(spec and IDB files are the files in which swpkg stores all the information about your product installation that you enter into the swpkg worksheets. For a definition of spec files, see IDREF="87148" TYPE="TITLE""What's a Spec File?".

The swpkg window always displays one of the five available worksheets. To see a worksheet other than the one currently displayed, use the Worksheet Selection tabs, discussed in IDREF="65956" TYPE="TITLE""Using the Worksheet Selection Tabs". Here are the five swpkg worksheets, listed in the order in which you should fill them out:Create Product HierarchyIDREF="93088" TYPE="TITLE""Creating a Product Hierarchy: The Basic Steps" lists the steps for filling out this worksheet.Tag FilesIDREF="47279" TYPE="TITLE""Tagging the Files: The Basic Steps" lists the steps for filling out this worksheet.Edit Permissions and DestinationsIDREF="49236" TYPE="TITLE""Editing Permissions and Destinations: The Basic Steps" lists the steps for filling out this worksheet.Add AttributesIDREF="37152" TYPE="TITLE""Adding Installation Attributes: The Basic Steps" lists the steps for filling out this worksheet.Build ProductIDREF="11306" TYPE="TITLE""Building the Product: The Basic Steps" lists the steps for filling out this worksheet.Work through the worksheets in order (beginning with the Create Product Hierarchy worksheet, which is the worksheet that's automatically selected when you start up swpkg). Fill in all necessary information before moving to the next worksheet. (It's necessary to work through the worksheets in order because the later worksheets depend on information entered in the earlier worksheets.)If you're new to packaging for Software Manager, you might want to read IDREF="88726" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "The swpkg Tutorial," before you try to use swpkg to package your own application.LBL="" HELPID="menu.bar"ID="96526"Using the swpkg Menusswpkg has three pull-down menus located on the menu bar, the horizontal bar at the top of the swpkg window.The three pull-down menus are:The File Menu, which allows you to clear, open, save, and append spec and IDB files or to quit swpkgThe View Menu, which allows you to hide or show the Message AreaThe Help Menu, which provides your main entry point into swpkg's online helpThe rest of this section explains each of the three menus in more detail.LBL="" HELPID="menu.bar.file"ID="94029"Using the File MenuThe File pull-down menu, shown in IDREF="50696" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-1, provides menu items that allow you to clear, open, save, and append spec and IDB files or to quit swpkg.

All of the File menu items log a message in the Message Area (located below the Worksheet Selection tabs).NoteWhen creating or renaming spec and IDB files, make sure that your spec filenames end with the .spec suffix and IDB filenames end with the .idb suffix.Here's a brief description of each of the items on the File pull-down menu:Use the "New" menu item to clear the spec and or/IDB file(s) for the current swpkg session of all entries. This overwrites any existing spec and/or IDB files for the current session. (swpkg posts a dialog asking if you want to abandon the current spec and IDB files before opening new ones. If you click the Cancel button, swpkg aborts creating a new spec and/or IDB file(s).)Use the "Open" menu item to open an existing spec and/or IDB file and load the information from the opened file(s) into the current swpkg session. This overwrites any existing spec and/or IDB files for the current session. (swpkg posts a dialog asking if you want to abandon the current spec and IDB files before opening new ones.

When you've finished, you'll have packaged an example application for installation. It's best to work along with the tutorial, completing the steps on your own workstation as you read through them.Noteswpkg is a versatile tool that allows you a great deal of freedom in creating installable files. Many of swpkg's features are not required to package an average product for installation. Rather than present all the features, this tutorial focuses on the basics needed to package an application. Don't worry that we don't use some of the buttons and text entry fields that appear in the worksheets. swpkg's more advanced features are discussed in the remaining chapters of this book.LBL="" HELPID="tutorial.setup"Step One: Setting Up the Example Application Used by This TutorialBefore you begin this tutorial, make sure you have the example application on your system. The example application is a loan calculator called finance. Given a term in years, the principle loan amount and interest rate, finance computes the monthly payment.   The files you need to use this sample application are part of the swpkg product. Before you begin this tutorial, set up the finance application by following these steps:Become superuser:% su Change to the directory containing the finance files:# cd /usr/share/src/swpkg To create the Makefile, enter: # xmkmf To compile the finance application, enter:# make LBL="" HELPID="tutorial.running"Step Two: Running swpkgTo run swpkg, enter:# swpkg A small dialog box appears with a copyright notice, requesting that you wait while the system initializes. Then swpkg appears.When swpkg first appears, it displays the first of its five main worksheets: the Create Product Hierarchy worksheet, shown in IDREF="27553" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-1.FILE="creat.prod.hierarchy.blank.ns.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="2-1"Figure 2-1 ID="27553"The Create Product Hierarchy WorksheetLBL="" HELPID="tutorial.hierarchy"Step Three: Creating a Product HierarchyThe Create Product Hierarchy worksheet helps you structure your product into three levels: product, images, and subsystems. This is called creating a product hierarchy. swpkg stores this product structure information in the spec file. (If you want more information now about spec files and product hierarchies, see IDREF="87148" TYPE="TITLE""What's a Spec File?", and IDREF="90360" TYPE="TITLE""About Product Hierarchies".)For our example program, finance, we're just going to use the simplest product hierarchy: a software image and a reference page image with one subsystem each. We enter this information into the Create Product Hierarchy worksheet and tell swpkg to save it in the spec file. To create the product hierarchy, follow these steps: In the text field labeled Product Name, change the text from "my_product" to "finance," then click the left mouse button on the Assign arrow button. (See IDREF="83246" TYPE="TITLE""Setting the Product Name" for more detailed instructions on setting product names.)If you neglect to click the Assign arrow button, swpkg will ignore your changes. After you click the Assign arrow button, the name of the node originally labeled "my_product" reads "finance."In the text field labeled My Product Description, change the product description from "My Product Description" to "Mortgage Calculation Program," then click the Assign arrow button on your keyboard. (See IDREF="33498" TYPE="TITLE""Setting the Product Description" for more detailed information on setting product descriptions.)NoteRemember to enclose the description within quotes. You can use either single or double quotes.It's a good idea to save the spec file at this point (although it is not necessary to do so, swpkg gives you a chance to save your spec and IDB files when you build your product). To save the spec file, open the File menu and select the "Save" menu item, then choose "Spec" from the rollover menu. (See IDREF="94029" TYPE="TITLE""Using the File Menu" for instructions.) A dialog box labeled "Save Spec" appears. Click the Ok button to save the spec file. That's it. You've created a product structure for your product and stored it in a spec file. Your completed worksheet should look like the one shown in IDREF="82872" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-2.FILE="creat.prod.hierarchy.tutorial.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="2-2"Figure 2-2 ID="82872"The Completed Product Hierarchy WorksheetNoteThe template in the Product Hierarchy graph follows Silicon Graphics conventions for structuring and naming a product. Silicon Graphics strongly recommends that you follow these conventions. Users are presented with this structure when they use Software Manager. The descriptions you provide for your product, images, and subsystems are the first information about your product that users see. LBL="" HELPID="tutorial.tagging"Step Four: Tagging the Files The next step is tagging the files, so that swpkg knows which files belong in which subsystem. To keep track of this information, swpkg stores this information in an installation database file (IDB file). swpkg uses the IDB file to keep track of all sorts of information about the files that comprise your product, such as which files are included in which subsystem, where the files are located, and where Software Manager should put the files when it installs them. (IDB files can include other information tooname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'for a more detailed explanation of IDB files, see IDREF="87631" TYPE="TITLE""What's an IDB File?"). For now, we'll use the Tag Files worksheet to create a simplest-case IDB file. First, switch to the Tag Files worksheet by clicking the tab labeled "Tag Files" (the second of the five Worksheet Selection Tabs at the top of the worksheet). When you do this, the Create Product Hierarchy worksheet is replaced by the Tag Files worksheet, shown in IDREF="57413" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-3. FILE="tag.files.blank.ns.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="2-3"Figure 2-3 ID="57413"The Tag Files WorksheetTo create a simple IDB file for the Finance product, follow these steps:Change the text in the text field labeled "File Browser" to:/usr/share/src/swpkg Press the <Enter> key. The contents of the /usr/share/src/swpkg directory appear in the File Browser.Select the files named finance, Finance.ad, finance.ftr, and finance.man from the File Browser. (To do this, use the scroll bar to scroll through the list of files in the directory until you find the file named finance and click the left mouse button on the finance filename. The line listing finance is highlighted in black. Then, hold down the <Ctrl> key and click the left mouse button on the Finance.ad,finance.ftr, and finance.man filenames.)Click the Add arrow button (located just to the right of the File Browser). These lines appear in the IDB File Viewer:finance.sw.base usr/share/src/swpkg/Finance.ad
finance.sw.base usr/share/src/swpkg/finance
finance.sw.base usr/share/src/swpkg/finance.ftr
finance.sw.base usr/share/src/swpkg/finance.man(Don't worry about the lack of the slash before the usr directory. swpkg strips the source root from the pathname and uses the root that you specify in the Source Tree Root text field in the Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet. The default source root is slash [/].)Notice that the lines listing the finance, Finance.ad, finance.ftr, and finance.man files now appear in bold in the File Browser. Files that are listed in the IDB File Viewer appear in bold in the File Browser so that they're easier to spot. Notice also that swpkg has assigned all four of these files to the finance.sw.base subsystem. This is because, when we added the files to the IDB File Viewer, the tag finance.sw.base was selected in the Tags Browser. The finance, finance.ftr, and Finance.ad files do belong in the finance.sw.base subsystem, but we'll need to switch the finance.man file to the finance.man.manpages subsystem. Click the left mouse button on the entry for finance.man in the IDB files list.In the Tags Browser, click the left mouse button on the finance.man.manpages tag. The line listing finance.man.manpages is highlighted in black.Click the left mouse button on the Assign arrow button.The IDB File Viewer now shows this line for the finance.man file: finance.man.manpages usr/share/src/swpkg/finance.manNow the finance.man file is assigned to the finance.man.manpages subsystem.It's a good idea to save the IDB file at this point (although it is not necessary to do so, swpkg will give you a chance to save your spec and IDB files when you build your product). To save the IDB file, open the File menu and select the "Save" menu item, then choose "IDB" from the rollover menu. (See IDREF="94029" TYPE="TITLE""Using the File Menu" for instructions.) A dialog box labeled "Save IDB" appears. Click the Ok button to save the IDB file. Now swpkg knows which files belong in which subsystems, and it has stored that information in the IDB file for the finance product. Your completed Tag Files worksheet should look like the one shown in IDREF="82212" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-4.FILE="tag.files.tutorial.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="2-4"Figure 2-4 ID="82212"The Completed Tag Files WorksheetLBL="" HELPID="tutorial.permissions"Step Five: Setting Permissions and Destinationsswpkg now knows which files are in which subsystems and where to find each file, but it doesn't know where you want the files installed or what the permissions should be. You provide this information using the Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet, and swpkg stores it in the IDB file that you created in Step Four. Open the Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet by clicking the worksheet selection tab labeled "Edit Permissions & Destinations." The Tag Files worksheet is replaced by the Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet, shown in IDREF="94583" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-5.FILE="permiss.destin.blank.ns.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="2-5"Figure 2-5 ID="94583"The Edit Permissions & Destinations WorksheetIn the Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet, you enter permissions and destination information for each file in your product. swpkg stores the information you enter in this worksheet in the IDB file. Later, when users install your product, Software Manager uses these lines to figure out where to install the files and how to set the file modes, owners, and groups. To edit the permissions information for the Finance.ad file, follow these steps:Double-click the left mouse button on the first item in the IDB File Viewer, the Finance.ad file. The current values for all the fields in the worksheet appear.In the text field labeled "Mode," change the mode to:444 In the text field labeled "Owner," change the owner to:root In the text field labeled "Group," change the group to:sys In the text field labeled "Destination Directory," change the destination directory to:usr/lib/X11/app-defaults In the text field labeled "Destination Filename," change the destination filename to:Finance Click the left mouse button on the lower of the two Assign arrow buttons.Save the IDB file by selecting the "Save" menu item from the File menu. (See IDREF="94029" TYPE="TITLE""Using the File Menu" for instructions.)You've finished filling in the worksheet for the Finance.ad file. The Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet should now look like the one shown in IDREF="86488" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-6.

In this example, we'll go with the simplest case: we'll use the exitop installation attribute to tell Software Manager to install the application's icon in the Icon Catalog after the user gives the quit command.To add an installation attribute, you need to switch from the Edit Permissions & Destinations worksheet to the Add Attributes worksheet. Click the left mouse button on the Worksheet Selection Tab labeled "Add Attributes."

LBL="" HELPID=""PrerequisitesTo package an application successfully, you need knowwhat objects need to be builthow these objects should be grouped within the productwhere the objects are locatedwhere they should be installed on the users' workstationswhat permissions they should have on the users' workstationsLBL="" HELPID=""About ID="90360"Product Hierarchiesswpkg requires that you organize your application's files into a three-level hierarchy. The highest level is the product level, the second level is the image level, and the third level is the subsystem level. At the product level, software is grouped into distinct products. At the image level, a single product's files are grouped according to type: for example, one image for the software, and another for reference pages. At the subsystem level, the files in each image are organized into groups of files that are installed as a unit. The purpose is to create subsystems consisting of related files that your users might want to install (or decline to install) as a group. For example, if your application provides several optional templates, you might group them together into a single subsystem. That way, users who are short on disk space, or who don't think they need the optional templates, can choose not to install that particular subsystem. Similarly, if all your documentation files (reference pages, release notes, online help, online books, and so on) are grouped into a single image, users can choose to install them all together, rather than subsystem by subsystem. So, if you choose your product structure carefully, you can make the installation process much easier for your users.LBL="" HELPID=""An Example Product HierarchyHere's an example of how you might create a product hierarchy for a simple application. Suppose you want to package a paint application called magritte. Let's say that the magritte application includes the basic application software, some clip art, a reference page, and some release notes. Here's a good way to structure your files for installation:Separate the software files (the application software and the clip art) and the documentation (the reference page and release notes) into two separate images, called sw and man, respectively. Divide the software image (sw) into two subsystems: one, called base, containing the base application software; and the other, called optional, containing the clip art. Divide your documentation image (man) into two subsystems: one, called manpages, containing the reference page and the other, called relnotes, containing the release notes. In this example, our product hierarchy would be one product (magritte) containing two images (sw and man), with each image containing two subsystems (base and optional, and manpages and relnotes, respectively).

(You might put optional software in a subsystem named optional, but this is not required.)If your product contains reference pages or release notes, it must also include an image named man that contains the subsystems that include the reference pages and release notes.The subsystem containing the reference pages must be named manpages and the subsystem containing the release notes must be named relnotes.You are not required to follow these conventions, but Silicon Graphics strongly recommends that you do.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="87148"What's a Spec File?swpkg stores information about the product hierarchy in the product specification (spec) file for your product.

For example, `Acme 1/2" Tape Support' is a valid description as long as you enclose it in single quotes.Click the Assign arrow button.The product description is a brief description of your product that begins with the product name. This description is the "long" name that appears in Software Manager listings (the description also appears in versions listings). The description should be brief but informative, since this might be the only information users have to help them to decide whether to install your software.In particular, the product description should begin with the marketing name of the product. Do not use the words "option," "version," "system," or "release," unless they are part of the name of the product (for example, Maintenance Release and Network File System).Here are some general guidelines for creating descriptions:Limit the string to 30 characters, if possible. Anything larger gets wrapped or truncated by Software Manager and versions.When abbreviating words, use only standard, easily understood abbreviations.Capitalize the first letter of each word, except prepositions.Do not use punctuation. Do not include part numbers or marketing codesInclude a market version number (version 1.2, for example)So, for example, assume your product is a mortgage calculation application called Mortgage Calculator, that this is the first version of the product, and that its marketing code is M3-486.

Since this description appears in Software Manager listings, it's important that the description be informative and distinct from the product and subsystem descriptions.

Do not include part numbers or marketing codes.LBL="" HELPID="spec.detail.imageversion"Changing the Version Number of the ImageChoose a version number for your images. You can keep the existing, default value for the version number or you can create a version number of your own. Some rules and suggestions for selecting version numbers are:The version number can contain no more than ten digits.The version number cannot contain a decimal. Do not use your software release number as the version number.Start with a low version number. The version number of each software distribution you create for your product is higher than the last value. Over the lifetime of your product, 999999999 is the highest version number you can use. After that, you must change product or image names.Type the version number directly into the text field labeled "Version," then click the Assign arrow button.LBL="" HELPID="spec.detail.imageorder"Changing the Installation Order of the ImageThe number in the text field labeled Installation Order tells Software Manager the order in which to install the various images. If you want to specify that some of your images be installed before others, select the installation order numbers accordingly. (Remember to click the Assign arrow button after typing in each order number.)Installation order is specified by numbers in the range of 0 to 9999. The lower the order number, the earlier that image will be installed. If you do not specify an order number, the default is 9999 (the highest order, meaning the last to be installed). Images with equal order numbers are installed in alphabetical order.Software Manager installs products in alphabetical order by default. Within each product, images are also installed in alphabetical order. Similarly, the subsystems in each image are installed in alphabetical order. For example, suppose there are two products, a and b. Each of them contains two images, sw and man. Each image has two subsystems, x and y. The installation order of these subsystems is:a.man.x
a.man.y
a.sw.x
a.sw.y
b.man.x
b.man.y
b.sw.x
b.sw.yYou can control the order in which images are installed. In the example above, for instance, when you package the b product you can specify that the subsystems in the b.sw image should be installed before the subsystems in the a.sw image.In the example above, to force b.sw to be installed before a.sw, give the b.sw image an order number less than 9999. The installation order of the subsystems would then be:b.sw.x

Essentially, this means telling Software Manager to replace one subsystem with another, usually newer, subsystem. You do this using the replaces statement.Replaces statements are powerful and flexiblename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'taking the time now to learn how they work will help you later when you need to make changes to your product. The replaces line is critical when a product is repackaged (for example, when files in the product get moved around, when subsystems get new names, and so on).A replaces line simply specifies that you want to replace an older subsystem with a newer subsystem. Specify the name of the subsystem and the range of version numbers you want replaced. Here's the format of the replaces statement:replaces name lowvers highvers or      replaces selfwherenameis the name of the subsystem that is going to be replaced.lowversis the lower boundary of the range of versions of name that should be replaced. It can be 0, or any version number value that you supply.highversis the higher boundary of the range of versions to be replaced. highvers can be one of the following:oldvers, defined as the current version minus 1an actual version number that you supplyselfSoftware Manager always assumes that a subsystem replaces an older subsystem of the same name. Since this is the default case, you do not need to specify it explicitly.You can specify as many replaces statements as you need.For each subsystem that has a replaces line, Software Manager looks to see if the subsystem specified in the replaces line is installed and if its version falls in the range given in the replaces line. If the installed version is in the range, the new subsystem is selected for installation automatically. If the new subsystem is installed, the old version is removed automatically.There are four typical ways to use replaces:Specify that a subsystem replaces older versions of itself.Specify that a subsystem replaces maintenance versions of itself.Specify that a subsystem replaces different subsystems that are now obsolete.Specify replacement directions in complex repackaging situations where one subsystem has become several or several older subsystems have been restructured into several new ones.Here are some examples of replaces statements:A subsystem gets a name change. Suppose that the subsystem rfind.man.rfind is split into two subsystems, rfind.man.client and rfind.man.server. To make sure that rfind.man.rfind is replaced properly, you could create a replaces statement that looks like this: replaces rfind.man.rfind 0 oldvers Alternately, you could specify an exact old version number so that your replaces statement would look something like this:replaces rfind.man.rfind 0 1006000106 Or, suppose two or more subsystems get repackaged into a single subsystem. For example, say the rfind.sw.client subsystem and the rfind.sw.server subsystem are combined and the new subsystem is called rfind.sw.rfind. To replace the old client and server, you would use these replaces statements: replaces rfind.sw.client 0 oldvers 
replaces rfind.sw.server 0 oldvers If either of the old subsystems rfind.sw.client or rfind.sw.server is installed, rfind.sw.rfind will replace them.Finally, suppose you want to replace a maintenance release of rfind.sw.client with a new base release. You need to replace both the maintenance release and the previous base release. Your replacement statements would look like this:replaces maint.rfind_sw.client 0 oldvers 
replaces rfind.sw.client 0 oldvers Setting IncompatibilitiesYou can specify that a subsystem in your product can be installed on a user's workstation only if one or more other subsystems are not installed. This is known as specifying incompatibilities. NoteDo not specify incompatibilities unless absolutely necessary.When incompatibilities are specified, Software Manager does not allow users to install subsystems that are incompatible. It checks for incompatibilities at two different times: When a subsystem is selected for installation, Software Manager determines whether or not it is incompatible with something that has already been installed.When the user quits, Software Manager checks again among the subsystems it has just installed for incompatibilities.The format for incompatibility statements is the same as for replaces statements. Specify the name of the subsystem and the range of version numbers you want to declare incompatible. The format of the incompatibilities statement is:incompat name lowvers highvers wherenameis the name of the subsystem that is incompatible.lowversis the lower boundary of the range of versions of name that are incompatible. It can be 0, or any version number value that you supply.highversis the higher boundary of the range of versions that are incompatible. highvers can be one of the following:maxint, the maximum value that a long int can holdoldvers, defined as the current version minus 1an actual version number that you supplyHere are some examples of incompatibility statements:To specify that the rfind.man.rfind subsystem is incompatible with the selected subsystem, you could create a incompatibility statement that looks like this: incompat rfind.man.rfind 0 oldvers Alternately, you could specify an exact old version number so that your incompatibility statement would look something like this:incompat rfind.man.rfind 0 1006000106 Setting PrerequisitesYou can specify that a subsystem in your product can be installed on a user's workstation only if one or more other subsystems are also installed. That is, you can set prerequisites for the installation of a subsystem. Do not specify subsystems outside your product as prerequisites unless absolutely necessary.

Then type the text specifying the prerequisites into the Rules text field. You can specify a list of subsystems that must all be installed in order for users to install the new subsystem:prereq (

       )
prereq (
        name lowvers highvers 
       )Remember to press the Assign arrow button to update the subsystem node after filling in the text area. Here are some examples of prerequisite statements:To specify that the rfind.man.rfind subsystem is a prerequisite for the selected subsystem, you could create a prerequisite statement that looks like this: prereq rfind.man.rfind 0 oldvers  Alternately, you could specify an exact old version number so that your prerequisite statement would look something like this:prereq rfind.man.rfind 0 1006000106To specify that the rfind.man.server subsystem and the rfind.man.client subsystem must both be installed in order for the selected subsystem to be installed, you could write a prerequisite statement that looks like this:prereq (

         rfind.sw.client 0 oldvers
        )To specify that either the rfind.man.server subsystem or the rfind.man.client subsystem must be installed in order for the selected subsystem to be installed, you would need to write two prerequisite statements. They might look like this:prereq (

Typically, these modifications are made to reflect site- and machine-specific information. It's important that you identify all the configuration files in your product so that modifications users made to older versions of these files are not lost during installation on the new versions.By checking the config attribute check button, you identify the selected file as a configuration file. You must then specify a configuration type to specify how to deal with each configuration file. There are three configuration types. The first configuration type, update, is listed on the large button located to the right of the config attribute. Click this button to see all three choices, then select the appropriate configuration type from the list.

The three types of lists and when they are executed are:preopThis list of commands is executed before installing the selected file.postopThis list of commands is executed after installing the selected file. Configuration files cannot have postops.exitopThis list is executed when the user quits Software Manager (assuming the user is installing the selected file).Although preops, postops, and exitops provide the flexibility to perform many types of processing at installation time, you should limit their use for these reasons:If the commands in a command list do any type of processing that increases the use of disk space, such as uncompressing files, the user could run out of disk space during installation because Software Manager has no way of knowing how much disk space is required.If files in the software product are modified during installation, the versions -m command reports them as being modified. This can be confusing for users because they have no way of finding out what the changes were and in many cases won't know that they were done during installation.Extensive processing in preops, postops, and exitops makes installations take longer.Errors that occur while running preops, postops, and exitops are very hard for users to diagnose and correct.To specify a list of commands for execution during installation, follow these steps:Select a file from the IDB file list.Select either the preop, postop, or exitop attribute.Type the desired commands into the text field associated with that attribute, making sure toenclose the list of commands in a pair of double quotesprecede semicolons with a backslash, if you want them taken literallypress <Enter> after each separate commandHere's an example of a one-line exitop command that sends mail to the developer when users install the application:"echo $USER@`hostname`.`domainname` got product | Mail me" Click the Assign arrow button when you're finished. NoteWhen saving your preop, postop, and exitop commands into the IDB file, swpkg converts any new lines into semicolons. When you start a new session with this IDB file, swpkg converts the semicolons back to new lines. So, when you type in your commands, you need to put a backslash in front of all "real" semicolons, to tell swpkg that you really do want a semicolon and not a new line.It's a good idea to include an exitop to install your application's icon into the Icon Catalog. To do this, you would select your executable file and type into the exitop text field:"tag tagnumber filename

This means that just one copy of each file is installed on the server and that copy is used by all diskless clients of that server. Your product may contain files that need to be duplicated for each client, typically because they are configuration files that must be modified for each client workstation.To indicate that a file is to be replicated for each diskless client, select the noshare attribute from the Attribute Viewer. After selecting this attribute, click the Assign arrow button to assign the attribute to the selected file.LBL="" HELPID="file.attrs.nostrip"The nostrip AttributeBy default, swpkg automatically strips all binaries. You can override this behavior by selecting the nostrip attribute from the Attribute Viewer. After selecting this attribute, click the Assign arrow button to assign the attribute to the selected file. (See the strip(1) reference page for more information.)LBL="" HELPID="file.attrs.mach"Specifying Hardware Restrictions: The mach AttributeIn most cases, the files you include in your software product are applicable to all models of Silicon Graphics workstations. However, swpkg does provide a mechanism for restricting the installation of files to particular models on a per-file basis. You can use this mechanism to prevent users from installing files on a workstation that can't run them (which is better than allowing users to install files that won't work properly). You'll need to set up installation restrictions if:your application doesn't run on all Silicon Graphics workstationsdifferent versions of a file are required for different modelsa file in your product doesn't apply to particular modelsTo restrict installation to specific models, you use the Machine Dependent (mach) attribute.

This sublist provides two buttons that allow you to automatically select either all the R3k boards or all the R4k boards. When you click one of these buttons, all the CPU boards of that type are automatically selected. You can still make further CPU board selections and deselections by clicking the check button corresponding to a particular CPU board.NoteThe R4000 boards include derivatives of the R4000 architecture, such as R4400.GFXBOARDThe GFXBOARD sublist allows you to specify the graphics boards with which the selected file is compatible. If you've already made selections from the CPUBOARD sublist, some of the boards in the GFXBOARD list may be disabled (grayed out).

Graphics board: GR2-ElanTo find out whether the workstation has an R3k or an R4k processor, look at the line that starts with "CPU." In this example, hinv lists an R3000 (R3k) processor.For more information on the type of CPU board, look at the first line of the hinv output. In this example, hinv lists an IP12 processor. The hinv output provides graphics board and subgraphics board information using a different terminology than is used in the GFXBOARD and SUBGR sublists. To determine the values for GFXBOARD and SUBGR from hinv output, first look at the line labeled "Graphics board." The IRIS Software installation Guide provides a table that maps the hinv output for each type of graphics board to the corresponding GFXBOARD and SUBGR values. Since new values of CPUBOARD, GFXBOARD, and SUBGR may have been added for new models of workstations released after the IRIS Software Installation Guide was published, always check the most recent Release Notes for System Software to see if there is a more recent list of the possible values of CPUBOARD, GFXBOARD, and SUBGR.NoteWhen you make selections of mach attributes, some of the buttons in the lists may appear disabled ("grayed out").

In general, rather than creating a maintenance product, it's better to create a new version of your product.A maintenance product contains only files that include bug fixes, new features, or support for new hardware. When users install a maintenance release, the files in the maintenance release overwrite existing versions of those files. If a previously installed file does not have a replacement file in the maintenance release, it is not removed.A maintenance release can include files from many products, but is packaged as one or sometimes two products. Product names for maintenance releases are usually of the form "maint" followed by a digit (this digit has no inherent meaning). Image names are created by taking the original product names and image names and joining them with an underscore (_) rather than a period. Subsystem names remain the same.
