It doesn't tell you everything you need to know to write your IRIX application, but it does give you an overview of IRIX and the tools and libraries it provides, and it tells you where to go to learn more.The IRIX operating system is Silicon Graphics' implementation of the UNIX operating system. All application programs written for Silicon Graphics platforms run in the IRIX environment. Writing an application with a graphical user interface that runs on Silicon Graphics platforms requires the IRIX operating system, a compiler for your source code, tools to build your user interface, tools to debug and tune your program, and typically one or more application libraries. This guide describes the software Silicon Graphics provides to perform these tasks.IDREF="91023" TYPE="TEXT"Figure i illustrates the relationship between Silicon Graphics software, your application, and your user. In this example, an application uses one of the application libraries, Open Inventor, to create an image and display it on the monitor.FILE="aboutThis.ras" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="i"Figure i ID="91023"Building an Application with Silicon Graphics SoftwareFILE="" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="" HELPID=""What This Guide ContainsThis introduction to programming on Silicon Graphics computers contains the following chapters:IDREF="27403" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 1, "The IRIX Operating System," briefly describes IRIX, the UNIX standards with which it complies, and the features added beyond UNIX to support the graphics and multiprocessing capabilities of Silicon Graphics platforms.

It also tells you about configuration management and version control software.IDREF="80680" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 6, "Application Libraries," provides an introduction to the application libraries you can use for graphics, image processing, digital media, and printer/scanner management applications.LBL="" HELPID=""What You Should Know Before Reading This GuideThis guide assumes that readers are experienced programmers who are familiar with a UNIX programming environment, but not necessarily familiar with IRIX. An understanding of object-oriented programming is helpful when reading parts of this book.LBL="1"ID="27403"The IRIX Operating SystemThis chapter provides a brief overview of the IRIX operating system, Silicon Graphics' implementation of the UNIX operating system. It describes IRIX compliance with standards, summarizes the features unique to IRIX (such as support for graphics hardware), briefly discusses writing device drivers (which run as part of the IRIX kernel), and lists the hierarchy of tools and libraries you can use when you write an IRIX application.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="28085"About the IRIX Operating SystemIRIX, Silicon Graphics' implementation of the UNIX operating system, is based on UNIX System V, Release 4 (SVR4). LBL="" HELPID=""Standards ComplianceIRIX provides standard SVR4 programming interfaces and BSD networking, and complies with the following standards:ID="01.IRIXOS1"System V Interface Definition, Issue 3 (SVID3), which is the defining document for SVR4. IRIX provides the SVR4 Applications Programming Interface (API) and the Applications Binary Interface (ABI) as defined in SVID3.X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 3 (XPG3), which specifies a set of programming interfaces to be provided by operating systems in order to facilitate the writing of portable programs.POSIX P1003.1, another standard for portable programming.X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (X11R6). IRIX provides the industry-standard X Window System‘.OSF/Motif‘ Release 1.2. IRIX includes IRIS IM‘, the Silicon Graphics port of the industry-standard OSF/Motif user-interface toolkit.OpenGL‘. IRIX provides a full implementation of this standard for 3D graphics.LBL="" HELPID=""InternationalizationInternationalization is the process of making a program capable of running in more than one spoken-language environment without recompiling. Internationalized software can be made to produce output in a user's native language, to format data (such as dates and currency values) according to local custom, and in other ways make the software more comprehensible for people whose culture is different than that of the original software developer.ID="01.IRIXOS2"IDREF="59814" TYPE="TABLE"Table 1-1 lists the internationalization features supported by IRIX and the standards with which this implementation complies.

ID="01.IRIXOS5"The International Standards Organization (ISO) has developed a standard known as the Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnection (ISO-OSI). This model uses a layered view of networking. The TLI, which defines an interface between two of these layers, provides a set of functions that applications can call to perform various network operations. TLI conforms to the MIPSÆ ABI (Application Binary Interface).Network interfaces (sockets) defined by the 4.3 release of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).The 4.3BSD Inter-Process Communication (IPC) facility provides a socket interface that enables low-level access to network addressing and data transfer. IRIX supports ID="01.IRIXOS6"libsocket, the standard SVR4 method of accessing the BSD4.3 networking interface. The libsocket library provides a socket interface that is MIPS ABI compliant.An implementation of the Sun MicrosystemsÆ Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library. ID="01.IRIXOS7"RPC implements a remote procedure call model, in which a procedure executing on a remote system can be treated as a local procedure call by the calling application. RPC enables synchronous execution of procedure calls on remote hosts and provides transparent access to network facilities.The IRIX operating system implements the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. The IP suite is a collection of layered protocols developed by the Department of Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA). The two most widely used IP protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The IRIX operating system implements the Internet Protocol suite and UNIX domain sockets using the 4.3BSD UNIX socket mechanism.ID="01.IRIXOS8"ID="01.IRIXOS9"LBL="" HELPID=""X Window SystemThe Silicon Graphics native X Window System is based on the X Version 11 Release 6 (X11R6) standard that supports multiple visuals, overlay windows, the X Input Extension, the Display PostScriptID="01.IRIXOS10"‘ Extension, the Shape Extension, and the Shared Memory Extension.

These interfaces include:ID="01.IRIXOS12"Low-overhead inter-process communication routinesname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'The IRIX IPC mechanisms use a shared arena (shared memory) for communication between processes. This arena is mapped into a process's user space, which means most of the shared arena IPC functions don't have to make system calls. This keeps overhead lower than for standard System V IPC. Read the chapter titled "Inter-Process Communication" in Topics in IRIX Programming for more information about shared arenas.Multiprocessor control routinesname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

Users can launch applications and select files using icons instead of pathnames. You can integrate your application into the desktop environment to give it the Indigo Magic look and feel. IDREF="56505" TYPE="TITLE""Indigo Magic Desktop Integration" provides an overview of desktop integration. The Indigo Magic Desktop Integration Guide covers the topic in detail.LBL="" HELPID=""Device DriversA device driver enables communication between a user process and a peripheral device. In addition to kernel-level drivers, there are user-level drivers and STREAMS modules. Device drivers perform functions such as taking the device online and offline, transmitting data from the kernel to the device, receiving data from the single device and passing it to the kernel, and handling and reporting I/O errors.ID="01.IRIXOS16"Silicon Graphics provides drivers for many popular devices. However, you still may find that you need to write a device driver to support a device for which no driver is available. The IRIX filesystem provides a device-independent interface that allows device drivers to be opened, read, written, and closed as though they were files. The program issues standard system I/O calls, and the system then calls the driver you've written to handle the device. IDREF="74553" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-1 illustrates the relationship between the various software modules that connect the user application and the device with which it needs to communicate.

This option provides the basic software and documentation for the development environment. ID="01.IRIXOS18"IDREF="65335" TYPE="TITLE""The IRIS Developer's Option" tells you more about the IDO.When you write an application for a Silicon Graphics platform, you can choose from a number of languages, toolkits, and libraries supplied by Silicon Graphics for developers. Your choice depends on the nature of your application and, to some degree, on your personal preference. Here are some choices you can make and the options available under IRIX:ID="01.IRIXOS19"A programming language. Choose a language that is best suited for your application. Silicon Graphics provides compilers for C, C++, Fortran, Pascal, and AdaÆ. If your application runs on a multiprocessing platform and performance is a key consideration, you may want to choose either Power C or POWER Fortran, the versions of C and Fortran with special support for multiprocessing.A graphical user interface. If you plan to incorporate a graphical user interface in your application, you can use one of the user interface toolkits provided by Silicon Graphics rather than writing your own. These toolkits are IRIS ViewKit‘ and IRIS IM, which is Silicon Graphics' port of the industry-standard OSF/Motif. They allow you to build an interface for your application that looks like the interfaces of other applications running in the Indigo Magic desktop environment.Software development tools. When you order the IDO, you receive tools for compiling, debugging, and tuning your application. These tools include the compiler driver, the dbx debugger, and several performance tuning tools. You can also order the CASEVision WorkShop, which provides several interactive, graphical tools for debugging and tuning your application. If your project is large, you may need configuration management and version control. You can use the CASEVision‘/Tracker and CASEVision/ClearCase tools for these tasks.An application library. You may want to use one of the application libraries developed by Silicon Graphics. These libraries provide tools for developers of 3D graphics, image processing, digital media, and printer/scanner management applications.IDREF="97514" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-2 shows, in a hierarchical arrangement, the components you can select.IDREF="97514" TYPE="TEXT"FILE="Fig1.2.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="1-2"Figure 1-2 ID="97514"Component Hierarchy of an IRIX Application ProgramNow that you have an overview of the IRIX programming environment, you're ready to learn more about the tools and libraries available and the documentation Silicon Graphics provides for reading about them.

Two Silicon Graphics compilers, C and Fortran, have preprocessors that analyze source code and produce, where possible, object code that utilizes the multiprocessor environment.LBL="" HELPID=""Power CIRIS Power C allows your program to make efficient use of Silicon Graphics multiprocessor platforms by generating code segments that execute concurrently. Power C consists of the standard C compiler and a preprocessor that automatically analyzes sequential code to determine where loops can run in parallel. The preprocessor generates a modified version of the source code with multiprocessing directives added. The C compiler, when it compiles the modified source code, interprets the directives and produces object code that uses multiple processors. An advantage of Power C is that you can use it to recompile existing serial C programs so that they run efficiently on multiprocessor computers without hand recoding.ID="03.IRIXLang4"The IRIS Power C Analyzer (PCA) is the C code optimization preprocessor that detects potential parallelism in C code. It also performs other optimizing tasks.

It is a preprocessor that automatically inserts special compiler directives into a Fortran program to produce a modified copy of the source. The Silicon Graphics Fortran 77 compiler can then interpret these directives to generate code that can run across all available processors. Because the directives inserted by PFA look like standard Fortran 77 comment statements, PFA does not affect the portability of the code to non-Silicon Graphics systems.

It is the lowest level programming interface to X. You can use Xlib to build a graphical user interface for your application, although most application developers choose higher level tools.It's difficult to build applications with a graphical user interface that uses a low-level library such as Xlib. The ID="04.IRIXUITools3"Xt Intrinsics library (or simply Xt) simplifies this task by providing a library of C language routines designed to facilitate the interface to Xlib. Xt is a standard established by the X Consortium that provides an object-oriented programming style in the C language. Xt routines can be used to create interface components called widgets. OSF/Motif, for example, uses Xt to create its widget set (see IDREF="33294" TYPE="TITLE""OSF/Motif and IRIS IM").Silicon Graphics implements Xlib and Xt as defined by the standard and supports them as dynamic shared libraries. LBL="" HELPID=""4DwmThe IRIS Extended Motif Window Manager, ID="04.IRIXUITools4"4Dwm, is an X Window System client based on mwm, the Motif Window Manager.

You can select either the OSF/Motif or the IRIS IM widget set for use with your application, although using IRIS IM widgets is preferable because their appearance conforms to the Indigo Magic style.In addition to the low-level building blocks such as buttons and scrollbars that IRIS IM provides, it also supplies some related software that isn't part of the standard OSF/Motif. This includes the GLwMDrawingArea widget for IRIS IM programs that use OpenGL to draw to a window within an IRIS IM application. LBL="" HELPID=""IRIS ViewKitIRIS ViewKit is a C++ toolkit that provides user interface facilities for applications. It defines a collection of high-level components that you typically must implement in all applications, for example, components such as windows, menus, and dialogs.

ELF is the format specified by the System V Release 4 Applications Binary Interface (SVR4 ABI).ID="05.IRIXDevTools3"ID="05.IRIXDevTools4"ELF provides support for dynamic shared objects (DSOs). A DSO is an object file that's shared by multiple applications as they are executing. The object code of a DSO is position-independent and can be mapped into the virtual address of several processes. DSOs are loaded at runtime (instead of at linking time) by the runtime loader, ID="05.IRIXDevTools5"ID="05.IRIXDevTools6"rld. DSOs replace the static shared libraries provided with releases of IRIX prior to IRIX 5.0. You can, and generally should, use them in place of archive libraries. Using DSOs with your application provides you with several benefits. These include the following:Overall memory usage is minimized because code is shared. Executables linked with DSOs are smaller (and take less disk space) than those linked with unshared libraries because the shared objects are not part of the executable file image.Executables containing DSOs don't have to be relinked if the DSO changes.DSOs are easier to use and build than the static shared libraries available in releases of IRIX prior to IRIX 5.0.Most libraries supplied by Silicon Graphics are available as DSOs. When you invoke a compiler driver to build an executable file from your source program, the driver links to DSOs unless you specify otherwise.You can build your own DSOs if you have the IRIS Developer's Option installed on your system.

OpenGL provides low-level graphics routines and is an interface to the graphics hardware. Open Inventor is a toolkit, built on OpenGL, that allows you to create interactive graphics applications.IRIS Graphics Library is a library of subroutines for creating 2D and 3D color graphics and animation.IRIS Performer is a toolkit for creating real-time graphics and visual simulation applications.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="64332"OpenGLOpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. It consists of about 120 commands that you can use to specify the objects and operations needed to create interactive programs that produce color images of moving 3D objects. OpenGL is an industry standard for 2D and 3D graphics rendering and is a part of the IDO. ID="06.IRIXLibraries2"OpenGL uses a client-server model for interpretation of commands. An application using OpenGL can run under IRIX on any Silicon Graphics platform and be rendered on a platform with another operating system and window system, provided the implementation of OpenGL on each platform conforms to the standard.OpenGL doesn't include commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input. For that you must work through the windowing system that controls your hardware. Since the OpenGL application programming interface (API) is independent of hardware platforms, window systems, and operating systems, porting among conforming implementations of OpenGL is an easy task.OpenGL allows you to build the models you need from a small set of geometric primitivesname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

You can write your application using the OpenGL API, although it's often easier to use one of the higher level libraries. Using the higher level graphics libraries makes rendering operations transparent to your application, which allows you to concentrate on your application rather than on the time-consuming details of rendering.NoteIRIS Performer and the ImageVision Library are being converted from IRIS GL (the precursor to OpenGL) to the OpenGL standard.The OpenGL library contains functions forrendering primitives (points, lines, polygons)controlling colors and lightingusing texture mapping to add surface characteristics to geometrysetting and controlling transformationsIDREF="94811" TYPE="TEXT"IDREF="94811" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-1 shows an object created by OpenGLname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

This environment, Impressario, has features for a wide range of IRIX audiences: printer and scanner driver developers, application program developers, and end users. Impressario allows files of different types to be printed on a wide variety of printers and allows images to be scanned from a scanning device, an IRIS screen, or a Silicon Graphics image file.ID="06.IRIXLibraries28"ID="06.IRIXLibraries29"Impressario provides the following libraries for application developers:libspool Provides an API to the IRIX printer spooling system and functions, allowing you to submit print jobs, query their status, and so on.libprintui Provides a graphical interface for printing that's compatible with IRIS IM.libpod Provides a network-transparent interface to the Printer Object Database (POD). Each printer has a POD that contains configuration, status, and other information about that printer.libscan Provides an interface to the Impressario scanning system.libstiff Allows you to read and write Stream TIFF (STIFF) files.libimp Allows you to read and write Silicon Graphics image files in RGB format.Impressario is built on top of the System V print spooling system. It provides model files, filters, and drivers to convert ISO text files, SGI images files, PostScriptÆ documents, and a wide variety of other file formats to a format suitable for both raster and PostsScript printers.
