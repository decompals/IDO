It may perform some or all of the following functions:Take the device online and offlineSet parameters in the deviceTransmit data from the kernel to the deviceReceive data from the device and pass it to the kernelHandle and report I/O errorsHandle exclusion and other multiuser, multitasking arbitrationLBL="" HELPID=""Device TypesThere are two basic types of devices available on any UNIX system: software devices, such as RAM disks, and hardware devices, such as hard disks and printers. Most of the discussions in this book are about hardware devices.LBL="" HELPID=""Software DevicesIn a UNIX system, the "device" driven by a software driver is usually a section of memory and is referred to as a pseudo-device. The function of a pseudo-device driver may be to provide access to system structures that are unavailable at the user level.LBL="" HELPID=""Hardware DevicesSome examples of hardware devices are CD ROMs, disk drives, tape drives, printers, scanners, and terminals.Hardware devices are categorized as block devices, character devices, mmapped devices, or networked devices. A block device is a mass storage device (such as a disk) that can accept data, store it, and return data to the processor in fixed-length transfers. A block device driver uses the integrated page cache for all data transfers. Device drivers that support the block interface are complex and are not covered in this manual.ID="chap11"ID="chap12"ID="chap13"ID="chap14"ID="chap15"A character device (such as a terminal, network interface, or plotter) is a device that deals with arbitrary streams of data that typically have no particular structure. In addition, many character devices impose alignment restrictions (such as ID="chap16"quad-aligned) and often require that you transfer data in multiples of the device's fundamental size. In particular, most IRIX devices doing DMA require the starting address at least to be aligned on a 32-bit boundary (the lowest two bits of the address are zeros). Unlike block devices, character devices do not use the integrated page cache.Mmapped device drivers are those in which the hardware is memory mapped into a user's address space. No interrupt or DMA service routine is available to the user process.Networked device drivers are covered in IDREF="81999" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 9, "Writing Network Device Drivers".It is possible, however, for some devices to fit both systems. Disk drivers often allow blocked, cached access as well as character, uncached access. Generally speaking, though, custom device drivers are most often written for character devices.In some cases, a controller board may have more than one device connected to it. A SCSI-bus controller board, for example, normally has up to seven devices attached to it, and there may be multiple boards.LBL="" HELPID=""Levels of Device DriversThere are two level of device drivers: user-level and kernel-level. For some devices, such as GIO bus cards, the device driver should be a kernel-level driver. Although it is possible to write a user-level GIO bus driver, it is discouraged because the user-level interfaces are not publicly available; in any case, most GIO bus boards are designed to take advantage of DMA, which requires a kernel-level driver.
 However, for devices that interface to a SCSI bus, EISA bus, or VME bus, it is possible to write a user-level device driver that controls the device by communicating directly to the bus.LBL="" HELPID=""User-level Device DriversUsers cannot always treat the user-level device as just another file to be opened, read, written, and closed with the standard IRIX system commands. If you write a user-level driver, you may have to provide your users with device-specific routines or encapsulate the functionality in an application. This is normally the case with printers and scanners, for example. LBL="" HELPID=""Kernel-level Device DriversDeciding whether you can write a user-level driver is not difficult. It is also fairly easy to decide whether to write a VME bus, EISA-bus, or SCSI-bus user-level driver. However, if you decide to write your own kernel-level device driver, it is a little more difficult to decide what sort of kernel-level device driver to write. This guide provides you with the criteria you need to determine the appropriate driver model for a given device.NoteBecause IRIX kernels cannot, as a rule, be preempted, any driver that sits in a loop waiting for some condition to be satisfied may tie a processor up for as long as it wants. Real-time processes, such as audio, are very sensitive to such delays.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="27449"System HardwareThe Silicon Graphics Indigo‘, Indigo 2‘, Indy‘, Crimson‘, CHALLENGE‘/Onyx‘, and POWER CHALLENGE‘/POWER Onyx‘ families of workstations and servers may contain the following hardware components:One or more MIPSÆ RISC CPUsLocal memory busZero or more VME-bus adaptersZero or more EISA-bus adaptersOne or more SCSI-bus adaptersZero or more GIO-bus adaptersAlthough each Silicon Graphics system provides a similar architectural interface, there are some hardware-specific differences that affect how you write a device driver. Most of this guide discusses only those features that are common to all systems. For a description of hardware-specific differences, see IDREF="34630" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix A, "System-specific Issues" (which also describes how to write drivers that work correctly across all Silicon Graphics systems).LBL="" HELPID=""Hardware PlatformsEach basic hardware design results in differences in the operating system kernel such that a driver must be compiled for each architecture.

That is, source code can be the same if interfaces are followed carefully. For further details, see IDREF="35547" TYPE="TITLE""CPU Types" in Appendix AID="26457"MIPS RISC ProcessorsAll MIPS 32-bit and 64-bit RISC processors have an on-chip memory management unit (MMU) that supports demand-paged virtual memory. For detailed information on the MIPS architecture, see MIPS RISC Architecture.LBL="" HELPID=""MIPS RISC Processors Interrupt MaskingID="chap17"Each device interrupts the CPU at a specific ID="chap18"interruptprioritylevel. While the CPU is serving an interrupt, it ignores any other interrupts at the same or lower interrupt level. To prevent device interrupts from occurring before your driver is ready for them, your driver can raise the processor interrupt level in the device driver at any time. After your driver executes the critical segment of code, it must restore the previous interrupt priority.ID="chap19"NoteOnly kernel-level drivers can handle interrupts.Raising the interrupt level is usually not sufficient to prevent your driver from being interrupted on multiprocessing systems. (See IDREF="17181" TYPE="TITLE""Reliable Multiprocessor Spinlocks" in IDREF="34630" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix A, "System-specific Issues.") Drivers on multiprocessing systems must use additional mechanisms, such as semaphores and spinlocks. (See IDREF="psema(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="psema(D3X)"psema(D3X)

.)LBL="" HELPID=""Understanding Driver Address Space Drivers have different functional needs for addresses, including:Mapping to (usually cached) physical memory for the driver's own codeStatic and stack dataDynamically allocated dataMapping to I/O control registers (called Programmed I/O or PIO)DMA address to map to physical memory for a controller to useTo describe kernel-resident driver address spaces, first recall the following points about the form of addresses in a user process:The virtual address is either 32 or 64 bits.The most significant bits are those in the virtual page number, which is translated to a physical page.An invalid address causes the user process to get a SIGSEGV, which typically results in a core dump.With respect to addresses in a kernel-resident driver:The virtual address is either 32 or 64 bits.A range of values, varying by processor type, called kseg0, translates 1:1 to physical addresses.kseg0 is often used for kernel code and data, as well as for some PIOs.A range of values, translated by the translation look-aside buffer ID="chap110"(TLB), are often used for dynamically allocated kernel data.ID="chap111"A driver should not assume that it knows that one type or the other is in use.A driver also has to manipulate DMA addresses. These address values cannot be used for driver (processor) load/store instructions; rather, they are for controller usage in DMA operations.CautionIf a driver executes a load/store to an address that is not valid, data corruption may result, or the kernel may panic.LBL="" HELPID=""Virtual to Physical Memory MappingThe R2000/3000 uses 4096-byte pages for virtual address mapping in the format shown in ID="chap112"ID="chap113"IDREF="77976" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-1. The most significant 20 bits of a 32-bit virtual address (the virtual page number, or VPN) allow mapping of 4 KB pages. The least significant 12 bits (offset within a page) are passed along unchanged. The three most significant bits of VPN (bits 31-29) further define how the addresses are mapped, according to whether the R2000/3000 processor is in user mode or kernel mode. NoteFor all device drivers, the R2000 and the R3000 processors are considered identical.FILE="Fig1-1.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="1-1"Figure 1-1 ID="77976"MIPS 32-bit Virtual Address Format (MIPS II Mode)The Crimson, R4000 Indigo, Indigo2, and Indy series workstations use a MIPS R4000 series microprocessor in MIPS II mode (see IDREF="77976" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-1). R4000 MIPS II mode implements the same address map as R2000/3000. (See the MIPS R4000 User's Manual for further details.) ID="chap114"FILE="Fig1-2.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="1-2"Figure 1-2 ID="87076"MIPS 64-bit Virtual Address Format (MIPS III Mode)The CHALLENGE/Onyx series uses the R4400, which is functionally the same as the R4000 for driver purposes, and the POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx series uses the R8000 processor. All MIPS processors use the same address mapping scheme in 32-bit mode; in 64-bit mode, they use R8000 (MIPS III) address mapping (see IDREF="87076" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-2).LBL="" HELPID=""ID="34822"Privilege States/ModesThe R2000/3000 provide two privilege modes:ID="chap115"KernelID="chap116"Analogous to the "supervisor" mode provided by other systems.ID="chap117"UserID="chap118"The mode in which the system executes non-supervisory programs.ID="chap119"The R4000/4200/4400/4600 provide three privilege modes:KernelFull privilege state (same as the R2000/3000 kernel mode).SupervisorID="chap120"A state of lesser privilege than kernel mode. When executing in supervisor state, the system has access to the supervisor and user address space, but not the kernel address space. This mode is currently unused in IRIX.UserThe same as the R2000/3000 user mode.The R8000 also provides three privilege modes:KernelFull privilege state.User 32-bitThe same as the R2000/3000/4000 user mode.User 64-bitR8000 64-bit user mode. LBL="" HELPID=""User Mode Virtual AddressingIn user mode, a 32-bit process has 2 GB of virtual address space, appearing to start at location zero. Therefore, all valid user-mode virtual addresses have the most significant bit cleared. If, when in user mode, your code tries to reference an address with the most significant bit set, it will generate an ID="chap121"ID="chap122"Address Error Exception. To help programmers detect a common error, page 0 is never mapped.LBL="" HELPID=""Kernel Mode Virtual AddressingBecause kernel virtual memory divides physical memory several different ways, you can control the use of data caches and ID="chap123"ID="chap124"Translation Look-aside Buffers (TLBs) by specifying ranges of virtual addresses with different attributes. ID="chap125"When the processor is operating in kernel mode, three distinct address spaces (in addition to kuseg) are simultaneously available:kseg0This virtual address range is cached but not mapped by the TLBs. This is the type of memory you get when you declare a global in your driver code. This memory goes through the data cache during read/write operations but is not mapped by the TLBs. It is easy to convert the kseg0 address to a physical address by using the masking address bits.NoteDriver globals may not always reside in kseg0; with loadable drivers, they may live in kseg2.kseg0ID="chap126" consists of 512 MB of cached, unmapped address space, starting at virtual address 0xa800000000000000.When the most significant three bits of an address are "100," the virtual address space selected is the 512 MB of kernel physical space, kseg0. The R2000/3000 directly maps references within kseg0 onto the first 512 MB of physical address space. These references use cache memory, but they do not use TLB entries. Typically, the operating system uses this segment of memory for kernel-executable code and static kernel data.kseg1This virtual address range is neither cached nor mapped. Memory does not go through the data cache during read/write operations, nor are the addresses translated by the TLBs. This space is used for ID="chap127"volatile memory.kseg1ID="chap128" consists of 512 MB of uncacheable, unmapped virtual address space, starting at 0x9000000000000000.When the most significant three bits of a virtual address are "101," the virtual address space selected is the 512 MB of kernel physical space, kseg1. The processor directly maps kseg1 onto the first 512 MB of physical space. The operating system typically uses kseg1 for I/O registers and ROM code.kseg2Although this virtual address range can be both cached and mapped by the TLBs, it is not physically contiguous. This is where automatic variables declared in your driver come from, and it is where calls such as kmem_alloc() get their memory.NoteUse the PHYSCONTIG flag to request physically contiguous pages.kseg2ID="chap129" consists of and address range of 1024 MB of cacheable, mapped virtual address space starting at 0xc000000000000000.When the most significant two bits of the virtual address are "11," the virtual address space selected is the 1 GB of kernel virtual address, kseg2, which uses TLB entries to map virtual addresses to arbitrary physical ones, with or without caching. The operating system uses kseg2 for stacks and per-process data that it must trap on context switches, for user page tables (memory map), and for some dynamically allocated data areas.kusegThis user physical space has only physical pages, from the point of view of a device driver. In kernel mode, access generates a bus error.Kernel virtual memory spaces k0, and k1 remain mapped unless you specifically unmap them; consequently, you can read from and write to these spaces from the bottom half of your driver. This is not true for kuseg.MIPS processors enter kernel mode whenever an interrupt, a system instruction, or an exception occurs, and return to user mode only with a "Return from Exception" instruction. In general, address mapping is different for user and kernel modes. However, the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) maps all references to user address space, ID="chap130"ID="chap131"ID="chap132"ID="chap133"kuseg, identically, whether those references are made from kernel or user mode. In addition, the TLB controls cache access.

Not available for custom devices.LBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus InterfaceThe VME (VERSA Module Eurocard) bus is an industry-standard bus for interfacing devices. It supports the following features:Seven levels of prioritized processor interrupts16-, 24-, 32-, and 64-bit address spaces8-, 16,- 32-, and 64-bit data accessesDMA to and from main memoryThe VME-bus does not distinguish between I/O and memory space, and it supports multiple address spaces. This feature allows you to put 16-bit devices in the 16-bit space, 24-bit devices in the 24-bit space, and 32-bit devices in the 32-bit space. So you must know which of the three address spaces that the board uses when designing a VME device driver. Most VME systems also support VME-SCSI adapters with two interfaces per board.IRIX assumes that VME devices are I/O channel resources and that they will relinquish bus access promptly to the MIPS processor. IRIX has no model for multiprocessing on the VME bus. PIO access is much slower than DMA, so you may want to "Just say `No' to PIO" for better performance.NoteOn some devices, you can use jumpers or switch settings to configure the device to use a particular address space. Some Silicon Graphics systems have DMA-mapping registers to make memory appear contiguous to the VME card.For additional information on VME-bus operation, see the ANSI/IEEE 1014-1987 Standard.LBL="" HELPID=""EISA-bus InterfaceThe EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture) bus standard is an enhancement of the ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) bus standard developed by IBM for the PC/AT. EISA is backward compatible with ISA and expands the ISA data bus from 16 bits to 32 bits and provides 23 more address lines and 16 more indicator and control lines. ID="chap135"The EISA bus supports the following features:all ISA transfersbus master devicesburst-mode DMA transfers32-bit memory data and address pathpeer-to-peer card communicationdynamic bus sizing (i.e., 32-bit bus master to 16-bit memory)For additional information on EISA-bus operation, see the ANSI/IEEE 1014-1987 Standard.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="40259"SCSI-bus InterfaceID="chap136"The SCSI-bus is an industry standard I/O bus designed to provide host computers with device independence within a class of devices, such as disk drives, tape drives, and image scanners. SCSI is an acronym for Small Computer System Interface.All Silicon Graphics systems that run IRIX 5.x or 6.0 provide an interface to at least a single SCSI-bus for peripherals that support the SCSI standard. Your device driver can place commands on the bus by using the SCSI host adapter driver. Systems with POWERchannel‘ I/O processor boards (IO3) support two SCSI interfaces per POWERchannel board; CHALLENGE systems support up to 32 SCSI interfaces. POWERchannel-2‘ (IO4) boards support many more SCSI interfaces per board. CautionAll SCSI devices on a bus should support the connect/disconnect strategy while performing operations that take relatively long periods to perform. However, while the device driver can be configured not to time out, serious system throughput and reliability issues could occur.Most VME systems also support VME-SCSI adapters with two interfaces per board.For additional information on SCSI-bus operation, see the ANSI standards X3.131-1986 and X3T9.2/85-52 Rev 4B.LBL="" HELPID=""GIO-bus InterfaceThe GIO-bus is a family of synchronous, multiplexed address-data buses for connecting high-speed devices to main memory and CPU for Silicon Graphics systems. The GIO-bus has three varieties: GIO32, GIO32-bis, and GIO64.The GIO32 is a 32-bit, synchronous, multiplexed address-data bus that runs at speeds from 25 to 33 MHz. This bus is found on R3000-based Indigos.The GIO32-bis is a 32-bit version of the non-pipelined GIO64 bus or a GIO32 bus with pipelined control signals. This bus is found on R4000-based Indigo and Indy workstations.The GIO64 bus is a 64-bit, synchronous, multiplexed address-data bus that can run at speeds up to 33 MHz. It supports both 32- and 64-bit GIO64 devices. GIO64 has two slightly different varieties: non-pipelined for internal system memory, and pipelined for graphics and pipelined GIO64 slot devices. This bus is implemented in the Indigo2 platform.For additional information on the operation of the GIO bus, see the GIO Bus Specification.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="12531"System SoftwareFor kernel-level device drivers, all 4.x and later versions of the IRIX operating system provide a consistent, device-independent interface that allows the user to treat a device as a file to be opened, read, written, and closed. These calls serve as the interface between the user and the device (see IDREF="42006" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 1-6). This means that, for most I/O operations, you need not provide the user with device-specific system calls. Instead, the user can use the standard system call, open(), to get a file descriptor for the device, then read, write, and close the "file" pointed to by the file descriptor. Internally, the system calls use the driver module that you have written to handle the device.FILE="Fig1-6.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="1-6"Figure 1-6 ID="42006"Device Driver Position in the KernelLBL="2"WritinID="55618"g a Device DriverThis chapter describes the general interface for both user-level and kernel-level device drivers and introduces the various user-level and kernel-level device driver models.It contains the following sections:IDREF="27045" TYPE="TITLE""Creating Device Drivers"IDREF="35263" TYPE="TITLE""Device-special File"IDREF="30634" TYPE="TITLE""Including a Device Driver in the Kernel"IDREF="91550" TYPE="TITLE""Driver Entry Points"IDREF="35705" TYPE="TITLE""Writing Other Driver Routines"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="27045"Creating Device DriversThere are two levels of device drivers: user-level and kernel-level. For some devices, such as GIO-bus cards, the device driver must be a kernel-level driver. You can write a user-level device driver, however, for devices that interface to a SCSI, EISA, or VME bus.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="27045"Creating User-level Device DriversUser-level device drivers let you use system functions to map the device to user space and perform simple I/O operations. You do not have to understand how the software environment affects devices in the IRIX operating system. However, where specific versions of IRIX, such as 5.2 and 5.3 (both 32-bit) and 6.0 (64-bit), affect your decisions, or the performance of your driver, the differences are noted.LBL="" HELPID=""Creating Kernel-level Device DriversIf you decide to write a kernel-level device driver, you need to become familiar with the software environment, conventions, and data structures that apply to device drivers running under the IRIX operating system. To create a kernel-level driver from scratch, you must:Create a device-special file.Create a master file.Write and compile the driver code (-coff) Compile the object file with the -coff compiler flag for all IRIX 5.x drivers but not for IRIX 6.0 drivers. While Indigo and Indigo platforms require this flag, IRIX 64-bit compilers do not support it. For the most appropriate flags for various system configurations, see the file /var/sysgen/Makefile.kernio.
.Create a kernel that includes the driver object code.Reboot using the new kernel.Debug the driver.Steps 4 and 5 may be omitted if the driver is loadable. See IDREF="89133" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 11, "Kernel-level Dynamically Loadable Modules (DLMs)," on how to make a device driver loadable. Except for step 3, all the steps in this procedure are simple and mechanical.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="35263"Device-special FileOnce you write a kernel-level IRIX device driver, communication with a device is a matter of accessing a file called a ID="chap21"device-special file. Each device has its own device-special file, conventionally kept in the /dev directory. Because IRIX makes kernel-driven devices look like files, a user-level process can use the standard operating system calls to open the file/device, read from the file/device, write to the file/device, and so on. For most I/O operations, the user program needs no device-specific system call when it deals with a device driven by a kernel-level device driver.

Instead, the kernel uses major and minor device numbers. The major device number identifies the driver module to use for a given special device. This varies among operating systems:ID="chap24"ID="chap25"IRIX 5.2 defines 255 distinct major numbers (0 to 254). IRIX 6.0 uses the same numbering scheme as IRIX 5.2.IRIX 5.3, on the other hand, defines only 511 major device numbers (0 to 510). While the change from IRIX 5.2 to IRIX 5.3 does not permit the use of all 14 bits of the SVR4 major_t value, it is a compromise between a demand for more major numbers and conserving kernel data space, since the number of major values defines the size of the MAJOR table and the [cb]devsw tables. This increases the size of the variable necessary to contain a major device number from an unsigned char to at least a short. The master.d/README files contain further information on this topic.Most device drivers do not need to know what their major number(s) are; those that do should use the DDI getmajor() routine and major_t data type to manipulate them. If you have been accessing the MAJOR array as an array of unsigned chars, it is now an array of unsigned shorts. The DONTCARE value has also changed, and the lboot program has been modified to accommodate these alterations.In any case, the number you choose as the major number for your device driver must not be assigned to any other device. See /usr/include/sys/major.h on your system for a list of assigned major numbers.The minor number is 18 bits long and can contain values from 0 to 0x3FFFF. The minor device number has no predetermined use, so your device driver can use the minor device number as you see fit. For example, the driver can use the minor device number to differentiate multiple devices on the same controller.ID="chap26"See the man pages for the MAKEDEV(1M), master(4), mknod(1M) commands for additional information.LBL="" HELPID=""Device-special File ExampleTo create a device-special file, use the ID="chap27"mknod command. For example:LBL="" HELPID=""Configuration FilesDevice controls are an extensible way to change or query things about devices. They fall into two categories: those intercepted by the X server and those used by the device drivers. The server uses the x_init controls, which change the way the X server views devices. The device drivers use device_init controls, which change device characteristics.You can issue X server device controls on the fly by using the devctrl program (in 4Dgifts While some of the files in /usr/poeple/4Dgifts are in the IRIX 6.0 release, 4Dgifts itself is not included.
) or by calling XSGIDeviceControl from within a program, or by storing them in configuration files, which reside in the /usr/lib/X11/input/config directory. There are (potentially) two configuration files per device in the directory /usr/lib/X11/input/config. The device_init options live in a file with the same name as the STREAMS module that implements the device (this is also the name of the link created in /dev/input). The x_init options live in a file with the X name of the device (as supplied by the STREAMS modules).

It requires the following files, all of which must reside under the ID="chap29"/var/sysgen directory:bootID="chap210"This file is a symbolic link to the directory /usr/cpu/sysgen/IPxxboot, where xx represents the CPU type. This directory contains all the device driver object files and archives. When your driver is successfully compiled, you must copy it to the /usr/cpu/sysgen/IPxxboot directory. The name of your driver must end with an ".o" suffix (or with ".a" if it is a library). See IDREF="35547" TYPE="TITLE""CPU Types" for a listing of MIPS CPUs and their IP numbers.NoteFor successful compilation, IRIX 5.x drivers require the -coff option; IRIX 6.0 drivers cannot use the -coff option.masterID="chap211"This file contains information that lboot uses to create the deviceswitchtable, as well as to indicate dependencies among other kernel modules. Each driver must have a master file stored in the /var/sysgen/master.d directory. The name of the master file must be the same as the software module. Among other things, the master file contains the major device number for the device-special file. It also contains a prefix used to build the driver entry points. For more information, see the master(4) man page.mtuneID="chap212"This directory contains information on the external system tunable parameters of the driver module, including default values and valid value ranges.

To create a new kernel:ID="chap214"Become root.Copy the current kernel to a safe place before rebooting.

Use ln to save space, use cp for reliability.# cp /unix /unix.origCreate the new kernel, /unix.install, by running:# /etc/autoconfig -f(Use the -v option during debugging.)Reboot the system. When you issue the reboot command, the system removes the current kernel and renames unix.install, the kernel you have just created, to /unix:# rebootNoteIf you include a just-written and undebugged device driver, create a debuggable kernel. See IDREF="32442" TYPE="TITLE""Making a Debuggable Kernel" in Chapter 10 for more information. It is also useful in this case to examine the generated file /var/sysgen/master.c to confirm that the entries for your new driver are correct.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="91550"Driver Entry PointsA set of ID="chap215"driver entry point routines define what the system must do when a user-level program executes a system call, such as open(), that accesses the device. Because the user expects to treat the device as a file, you must write a driver entry point routine for each operation normally performed on a file, such as open, read, write, and close. You will probably also have to write additional driver routines to handle initialization at system power-up.When you successfully configure a driver into the kernel, lboot automatically adds members (one for each entry point in the driver) to the cdevswID="chap216" structure, the character device switch table.ID="chap217"NoteThe cdevsw structure is used for character device drivers; a block device driver structure would be named bdevsw. STREAMS drivers, which have user-accessible device nodes, such as /dev/llc2, also belong in the cdevsw structure; STREAMS modules, which have no device nodes, belong in fmodsw.The section of the cdevsw structure that maintains the pointers to the device entry points for a device called drv would look like this:struct cdevsw cdevsw[] = {
    { nodevflag, 0, drvopen, drvclose, drvread, drvwrite,
    drvioctl, drvmmap, drvmap, drvunmap, drvpoll, 0, 0 },
};When the kernel handles a system call, it can find a specific entry point for a device if it constructs the name of the appropriate cdevswID="chap218" member. For example, if the kernel must handle an open() for a device, drv, the kernel knows that drvopen is the member of csdevsw that contains a pointer to the open routine for the drv device.LBL="" HELPID=""Missing Driver Entry PointsIf your driver is missing a definition for an entry point, lboot generates a stub that points to ID="chap219"nulldev(). If the user makes the corresponding system call on that device, the system call returns an error. Your driver must always include definitions for some driver entry points, such as the device ID="chap220"open() and close() entry points. However, many devices do not perform memory mapping and, therefore, do not need the ID="chap221"map() and unmap() entry points. You may omit such entry points from the driver object module.LBL="" HELPID=""Character and Block Entry Point Driver RoutinesCurrently, the standard names for entry points are as shown in IDREF="50868" TYPE="TABLE"Table 2-1:COLUMNS="4"LBL="2-1"Table 2-1 ID="50868"Standard Entry PointsLEFT="0" WIDTH="83"drvopen()LEFT="90" WIDTH="83"drvclose()LEFT="180" WIDTH="83"drvread()LEFT="270" WIDTH="83"drvwrite()LEFT="0" WIDTH="83"drvinit()LEFT="90" WIDTH="83"drvedinit()LEFT="180" WIDTH="83"drvmmap()LEFT="270" WIDTH="83"drvmap()LEFT="0" WIDTH="83"drvunload()LEFT="90" WIDTH="83"drvunmap()LEFT="180" WIDTH="83"drvpoll()LEFT="270" WIDTH="83"drvioctl()LEFT="0" WIDTH="83"drvhalt()LEFT="90" WIDTH="83"LEFT="180" WIDTH="83"LEFT="270" WIDTH="83"Your driver normally contains an entry point named for at least drvopen(), drvclose(), drvread(), and drvwrite().

Your code for the ID="chap243"drvopen() routine must be able to handle requests from multiple processes and to make appropriate responses, depending on the current state of the device. For example, an exclusive user device may be in a busy or not busy state; or a multiuser device may be not in use and in need of initialization; or the same device may be in use, initialized, and able to handle more users or not.Also, drivers need a way to determine the ABIID="chap244" (Application Binary Interface) of the current user process so they can properly interpret structures passed in for ioctls. By using the following defines, which give the driver the size of various entities in bytes, a function in usrabi returns an error if no user process is running or else copies the type size information into a structure provided by the caller.

When the transfer terminates, whether normally (upon completion) or abnormally (due to some error), the device sends an interrupt to the CPU. When the system receives the interrupt from the device, it looks in your device driver for the drvintr() routine and executes that routine. Some devices can interrupt when the open count is zero. The interrupt still must be handled. When the device I/O completes., the drvintr() routine awakens the sleeping process. Within the drvintr() routine, you can use the kernel function biodone() to awaken the sleeping process and report the status of the transfer (whether normal or error).For a SCSI device, there must not be a drvintr() routine because the driver is a "soft" driver that does not interact directly with the hardware. Instead, a callback routine is often provided. This routine may be given any name, but it is often of the form drv_intr():drv_intr(scsi_request_t *sp);ArgumentsspA pointer to a scsi_request_t type structure. (See the sample code in IDREF="83716" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Writing a SCSI Device Driver," for an example of a drv_intr() routine written for a SCSI type device.) You must explicitly pass drv_intr() in the sr_notify member of the scsi_request_t structure allocated for the device.LBL="" HELPID=""strategy ≠ Perform Block I/OID="chap288"The ID="chap289"drvstrategy() routine is not a character device driver entry point in the strictest sense (the user does not call it). However, when writing a device driver, you will probably want to write a drvstrategy() routine. Typically, you call the drvstrategy() routine from the drvread() and drvwrite() routines, through the physiock() kernel routine:drvread (dev_t dev, uio_t *uiop, cred_t *crp)
{
    return physiock(drvstrategy, 0, dev, B_READ,
           nblocks, uiop);
}
drvwrite (dev_t dev, uio_t *uiop, cred_t *crp)
{
    return physiock(drvstrategy, 0, dev, B_WRITE,
           nblocks, uiop);
}physiockID="chap290"() is a kernel routine that:Verifies whether the requested transfer is valid by checking whether the offset is at or past the end of the device and verifying that the offset is a multiple of the block size (512).Sets up a buffer header that describes the transfer.Faults pages in and locks the pages involved in the I/O transfer so they cannot be swapped out.Calls the strategy routine passed by the first parameter.Sleeps until the transfer is complete and awakens when the driver's I/O completion handler calls biodone().Performs the necessary cleanup and updates, then returns to the routine that called it.physiock() reports a data transfer as valid if the following conditions are met:the specified data location exists on the device the user has specified a storage area that exists in user memory space the user-space storage area is large enough.

 man page.NoteIn IRIX 5.x and earlier, pages are 4 KB, and the default maximum DMA size is 4 MB; in IRIX 6.0, pages are 16 KB, and the default maximum DMA size is 16 MB. You can change the DMA size by modifying maxdmasID="chap291"z, in /var/sysgen/mtune/kernel, using page as the basic unit. For other ways to modify this parameter, see the systune(1M) man page. I/O larger than what is allowed by maxdmasz produces the UNIX error ENOMEM. See IDREF="32705" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix B, "SCSI Controller Error Messages".If the second argument is 0, physiock() then allocates an IRIX buffer header (a kernel-level structure of type buf) and primes it with appropriate transfer information; otherwise, physiock() uses the argument as a pointer to a buf_t. This structure encapsulates all the information of a single I/O transfer.physiock() assigns the values of the following ID="chap292"buf type structure members:b_un.b_addrID="chap293"Contains the kernel virtual address from which information is read or to which information is written.b_flagsID="chap294"Contains a bit mask of flags that describe the transfer. B_BUSY is set to indicate that the buffer is in use for an I/O transfer. B_READ is set if the transfer is a read.b_bcountID="chap295"Contains the number of bytes to be transferred.b_edevID="chap296"Contains the major and minor device numbers.b_blknoID="chap297"Contains the device block number to be transferred.b_residID="chap298"On completion, before calling biodone(), the driver must set this member to the number of bytes that were not transferred.b_biodoneID="chap299"If nonzero, this is taken as a function pointer, and the routine in question is called from biodone(); all normal biodone() processing is skipped. b_biodone may also be set by the user.Finally, physiock() calls drvstrategy() and hands it a pointer to this buf structure.

{
    <your code>
}Your ID="chap2100"drvstrategy() routine programs the device for the transfer. The information it needs to do this is contained in the structure pointed to by bp. Typically, your drvstrategy() routine starts the I/O by programming appropriate registers. When drvstrategy() is done, control returns to physiock(). physiock() then calls ID="chap2101"biowait(), and the process sleeps until the transfer is complete.Normally, your interrupt handler will call ID="chap2102"biodone(bp) on completion. But before calling biodone(), your driver must have saved the bp value passed to the strategy routine. (You must awaken the sleeping process even if there is some initial error condition.) In addition, your drvintr() routine must indicate the success of the transaction by updating the ID="chap2103"b_residID="chap2104" member of the buf_t type structure to contain the number of bytes that were not transferred, then move to the next page.To handle any I/O errors that occur, use bioerror (bp, errno), where bp is a pointer to the buf_t type structure passed in as the first parameter of your drvstrategy(), and errno is the appropriate error number. ID="chap2105"bioerror() sets the members of the buffer header so that higher level code can detect the error and call ID="chap2106"geterror() to retrieve the error number from the structure.CautionYour drvintr() routine and the routines it calls must not try to access the uiop structure directly. The structure it gets might not belong to the process that made the I/O request.LBL="" HELPID=""edtinit and init ≠ Initialize a DeviceID="chap2107"Most devices need some initialization at boot time. The system looks in the object module for the driver for either of two routines, ID="chap2108"drvinit() or ID="chap2109"drvedtinit(), then executes the appropriate routine to initialize the device. If you use the INCLUDEID="chap2110" directive (in the /var/sysgen/system/irix.sm file) to add a device to the kernel, your driver must use the drvinit() routine to initialize the device at boot time. If you use the VECTORID="chap2111" directive, your routine must use the drvedtinit() routine to initialize the device at boot time.Because you use the INCLUDE directive to include SCSI device drivers in the kernel, your drivers for SCSI devices must include a drvinit() routine if you want to initialize the device at boot time (in which case, no edtinit() call will be generated). See IDREF="83716" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Writing a SCSI Device Driver," for a synopsis of the drvinit() routine.Because you use the VECTOR directive to include VME device drivers in the kernel, your device drivers for VME devices must include a drvedtinit() routine to initialize the device at boot time. See IDREF="61787" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 3, "Writing a VME Device Driver," for a synopsis of the drvedtinit() routine and a discussion of VME-bus address space and PIO mapping.Most device drivers of the general memory-mapping model are for VME type devices. (See ID="chap2112"IDREF="12573" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 7, "Writing Kernel-level General Memory-mapping Device Drivers.") Therefore, most device drivers of the general memory-mapping model are included in the kernel using the VECTOR directive. Your object module for this type of device driver usually contains a drvedtinit() routine.Synopsisvoid drvedtinit(struct edt *e);LBL="" HELPID=""halt ≠ Shut Down the Driver When the System Shuts DownThe drvhalt() routine, if present, is called to shut the driver down when the system is shut down. After the drvhalt() routine is called, no more calls are made to the driver entry points.This entry point is optional. The device driver can not assume that the interrupts are enabled. The driver must make sure that no interrupts are pending from its device and must inform the device that no more interrupts are to be generated.Synopsisvoid drvhalt(void);Return ValuesNoneLBL="" HELPID=""start ≠ Initialize a Device at System StartupThe drvstart() routine is called at system boot time (after system services are available and interrupts have been enabled) to initialize drivers and the devices they control.This entry point is optional.

The ID="chap2116"put routine is called by the preceding component (module, driver, or stream head) in the stream. put routines are designated write or read depending on the direction of message flow.This entry point is required in all STREAMS drivers and modules.Synopsisdrvput(register queue_t *q, register inblk_t *mp);UsageBoth modules and drivers must have put routines for writing. Modules must have put routines for reading, but drivers do not really need them because their interrupt handlers can do the work intended for the read put routine. If immediate processing is desired when a message is passed to the put routine, it can either process the message or queue it so that the service routine can process it later. See IDREF="srv(D2)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="srv(D2)"srv(D2)
.NoteThe majority of STREAMS drivers are software drivers, however, and do not have interrupt handlers.The put routine must do at least one of the following when it receives a message:pass the message to the next component in the stream by calling the IDREF="putnext(D3)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="putnext(D3)"putnext(D3)
 functionprocess the message, if immediate processing is required (for example, high-priority messages)queue the message with the IDREF="putq(D3)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="putq(D3)"putq(D3)
 function for deferred processing by the service routineTypically, the put routine switches on the message type, which is contained in mp->b_datap->db_type, taking different actions depending on the message type. For example, a put routine might process high-priority messages and queue normal messages.The putq function can be used as a module's put routine when no special processing is required and all messages are to be queued for the service routine.NotesAlthough queue flushing can be done in the service routine, drivers and modules usually handle it in their put routines.Drivers and modules should not call put routines directly.Drivers should free any messages they do not recognize.Modules should pass on any messages they do not recognize.Drivers should fail any unrecognized M_IOCTL messages by converting them into M_IOCNAK messages and sending them upstream.Modules should pass on any unrecognized M_IOCTL messages.Return ValuesIgnoredSynchronization Constraintsput routines do not have a user context and so may not call any function that sleeps.LBL="" HELPID=""srv ≠ Service RoutineThe srv (service) routine may be included in a STREAMS module or driver for a number of reasons. It provides greater control over the flow of messages in a stream by allowing the module or driver to reorder messages, defer the processing of some messages, or fragment and reassemble messages. The service routine also provides a way to recover from resource allocation failures.Synopsisdrvsrv(register queue queue_t *q);UsageThis entry point is optional and is valid for STREAMS drivers and modules only.A message is first passed to a module's or driver's IDREF="put(D2)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="put(D2)"put(D2)
 routine, which may or may not process it. The put routine can place the message on the queue for processing by the service routine.Once a message has been queued, the STREAMS scheduler calls the service routine at some later time. Drivers and modules should not depend on the order in which service procedures are run. This is an implementation-dependent characteristic. In particular, applications should not rely on service procedures running before returning to user-level processing.Every STREAMS queue has limit values it uses to implement flow control (see IDREF="queue(D4)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="queue(D4)"queue(D4)
. High and low water marks are checked to stop and restart the flow of message processing. Flow control limits apply only between two adjacent queues with service routines. Flow control occurs by service routines following certain rules before passing messages along. By convention, high-priority messages are not affected by flow control.STREAMS messages can be defined to have up to 256 different priorities to support some networking protocol requirements for multiple bands of data flow. At a minimum, a stream must distinguish between normal (priority band zero) messages and high-priority messages (such as M_IOCACK). High-priority messages are always placed at the head of the queue, after any other high-priority messages already queued. Next are messages from all included priority bands, which are queued in decreasing order of priority. Each priority band has its own flow control limits. By convention, if a band is stopped, all lower priority bands are also stopped.Once a service routine is called by the STREAMS scheduler, it must provide for processing all messages on its queue, restarting itself if necessary. Message processing must continue until either the queue is empty, the stream is flow-controlled, or an allocation error occurs. Typically, the service routine switches on the message type contained in mp->b_datap->db_type, taking different actions depending on the message type. Each STREAMS module and driver can have a read and write service routine. If a service routine is not needed (because the put routine processes all messages), a NULL pointer should be placed in the module's IDREF="qinit(D4)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="qinit(D4)"qinit(D4)
 structure.If the service routine finishes running for any reason other than flow control or an empty queue, then it must explicitly arrange for its rescheduling. For example, if an allocation error occurs during the processing of a message, the service routine can put the message back on the queue with putbq and, before returning, arrange to have itself rescheduled at a later time.

It gives a brief overview of the VME-bus interface, describes system configuration for VME device drivers, and introduces several VME-specific routines you must include in your device driver. Which of the several models for performing DMA ID="chap31"(direct memory access)ID="chap32" operations you choose for your device driver depends on the capability of the device (whether the device has scatter/gather registers, for example), the address space of the device (VME A24, A32, or A64), and whether the device provides address mapping capability.It contains the following sections:IDREF="35286" TYPE="TITLE""VME-bus Interface Overview"IDREF="57116" TYPE="TITLE""Choosing a Driver Model"IDREF="27051" TYPE="TITLE""Writing User-level VME Device Drivers"IDREF="76966" TYPE="TITLE""Writing Kernel-level VME Device Drivers"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="35286"VME-bus Interface OverviewAll high-end Silicon Graphics systemsname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

			descr='[mdash]'do not currently support the VME bus. The VME bus is an industry-standard bus for interfacing devices. It supports the following features:Seven levels of prioritized processor interrupts16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit data addresses and 64-bit memory addresses16-bit and 32-bit accesses (and 64-bit accesses in MIPS III mode)8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit data transferDMA to/from main memoryThe VME bus does not distinguish between I/O and memory space, and it supports multiple address spaces. This feature allows you to put 16-bit devices in the 16-bit space, 24-bit devices in the 24-bit space, 32-bit devices in the 32-bit space, and 64-bit devices in 64-bit space. 64-bit data transfers, accesses, and memory addresses do not depend on a 64-bit kernel, so they can be mapped to all MIPS R4000 series platforms.
 So you must know which of the four address spaces the board uses when you design a VME device driver.NoteOn some devices, you can use jumpers or switch settings to configure the device to use a particular address space. Some systems have DMA-mapping registers to make memory appear contiguous to the VME card.For additional information on VME-bus operation, see the ANSI standards specification for the VME bus.LBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus AdapterThe term VME-bus adapter (see IDREF="95352" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 3-1) refers to a hardware conduit that translates host CPU operations to VME-bus operations and decodes some VME-bus operations (as though the conduit were a memory board) to translate them to the host side.FILE="Fig3-1.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="3-1"Figure 3-1 ID="95352"VME-bus AdapterLBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus Address SpaceThe VME bus provides 32 address bits and six address-modifier bits. It supports four address sizes: 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bits (A16, A24, A32, and, on CHALLENGE/Onyx and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx series systems, A64). The VME bus allows the master to broadcast addresses at any of these sizes. The VME bus supports data transfer sizes of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits. To best understand the VME-bus addressing and address space, think of the device as consisting of two halves: the master and the slave. When the CPU accesses the address space of the device, the device acts as a VME slave. When the VME device accesses main memory through direct memory access (DMA) operations, the VME device acts as a VME master.Addressing behavior for a driver depends on whether the CPU or the device is the master. For example, a VME device can be a 16-bit slave and a 32-bit master. Silicon Graphics systems support 16-, 24-, and 32-bit slaves, but only 24- and 32-bit masters.Some Silicon Graphics systems provide additional hardware mapping registers that map a VME-bus address to an arbitrary location in physical memory. Device drivers can take advantage of this mapping hardware to provide scatter/gather capabilities (and to support DMA operations to all of memory for A24 devices). The IRIX operating system provides a procedural interface by which your device driver can allocate and use these maps. This interface also has a provision to handle multiple VME-bus systems.For other systems, 24-bit VME masters can access only the lowest 8 MB of physical memory, The highest bit is used to distinguish between user and supervisor access.
 so device drivers may need to allocate buffers in low memory and then copy data to its final destination. See /usr/include/sys/vmereg.h for macro #devices to facilitate VME access.ID="chap33"LBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus Read-Modify-Write CycleThe VME bus provides a read-modify-write (or RMW) cycle that allows users to read and change the contents of a device register or memory location in a single atomic operation. Although this feature is typically used to implement synchronization primitives on VME memory, you may occasionally find this feature useful for certain devices. The VME-bus adapter provides access to VME read-modify-write cycles through a set of kernel functions, such as pio_andh_rmwID="chap34"ID="chap35"() and pio_orw_rmwID="chap36"ID="chap37"().CautionThe VME RMW cycle is needed only when a controller allows both itself and a user to write a register. If a disk controller uses a single register for the status and command information for several disk drives, for example, you could be writing a command into the register from the driver while the disk controller is updating the status. The VME RMW cycle enforces exclusive use of an address. Since this operation is expensive, in terms of resources, it should rarely be used.NoteSilicon Graphics products do not support VME read-modify-write operations initiated by a VME master to host memory.LBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus Adapter RequestsThe VME-bus adapter provides four levels of bus request, 0-3, (3 has the highest priority) for DMA arbitration. Do not confuse these ID="chap38"bus request levels with the interrupt priorities described below. Bus requests prioritize the use of the physical lines representing the bus and are normally set by means of jumpers on the interface board. The IRIS-4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30, and 4D/35 support only Bus Request level 3 and Bus Grant level 3.LBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus InterruptsThe VME bus supports seven levels of prioritized interrupts, 1 through 7 (where 7 has the highest priority). The VME-bus adapter has a register associated with each level. On Silicon Graphics systems, all VME interrupts come in at the same CPU interrupt level. When the system responds to the VME-bus interrupt, it services all devices identified in the interrupt vector register in order of their VME-bus priority (highest number first). The operating system then determines which interrupt routine to use, based on the interrupt level and the interrupt vector value.NoteOn systems equipped with multiple VME buses, adapter 0 has the highest priority; other adapters are prioritized in ascending order (after 0).No device can interrupt the VME bus at the same level as an interrupt currently being serviced by the CPU because the register associated with that level is busy. A device that tries to post a VME-bus interrupt at the same VME-bus priority level as the interrupt being serviced must wait until the current interrupt is processed.Therefore, when choosing VME-bus priority levels for devices, be sure that the priority levels are well distributed. If you must double up on VME-bus priority levels, double up on those devices not likely to need the CPU at the same time.NoteAll VME interrupt levels map into one CPU interrupt level.LBL="" HELPID=""Distribution of VME Interrupts on MultiprocessorsOn CHALLENGE/Onyx, POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx, and   multiprocessor POWER Series systems, VME interrupt levels can be individually locked onto any processor in the system through the IPL directive. This prevents a processor running a real-time process or a process that needs a guaranteed response from being interrupted inconveniently, and it makes system load balancing easier. To lock a particular VME interrupt level to a processor, edit the /var/sysgen/system/irix.smID="chap39"ID="chap310"ID="chap311" file, then run lboot to implement the changes. The format is:IPL: level cpu#where level is the priority level (1-7, with 7 being the highest), and cpu# is the number of the CPU on which you want the VME interrupts of that level to occur. For example:IPL: 4 1designates VME interrupt priority level 4 on CPU number 1.CHALLENGE/Onyx and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx and   multiprocessor POWER Series‘ systems take advantage of multiple CPUs by distributing interrupts across all processors. These distributed interrupts are called ID="chap312"sprayed interrupts. To declare a CPU that is not suitable for sprayed interrupts (usually because they will be used for real-time activities), use the ID="chap313"NOINTR directive.Example: to declare that CPU 3 will not accept sprayed interrupts, use: NOINTR: 3You can tie a VME interrupt to a processor that accepts no sprayed interrupts using the IPL directives described above. You may not restrict CPU 0 from receiving interrupts. You can specify multiple CPUs on the NOINTR line.After editing the irix.sm file, you must run lboot to reconfigure the system before the changes can take effect. autoconfig is a script in /etc/init.d that runs lboot. See the  ID="chap314"ID="chap315"autoconfig(1M), lboot(1M), and system(4) man pages for details.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="57116"Choosing a Driver ModelChoosing between a user-level device driver and a kernel-level device driver model usually depends on the method used to transfer data to and from the device. However, the two driver models are not necessarily mutually exclusive. It is possible, for example, for a single VME driver to use both direct memory access (DMA) and memory mapping to transfer data.ID="chap316"ID="chap317"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="28926"User-level VME-bus Device DriverThe easiest way to handle a VME device is to write a user-level program that controls the device by dealing directly with the special /dev/vme driver. You can write a user-level device driver when your users need to access a VME-bus device that is not interrupt driven and does not require DMA operations. In fact, many boards that use DMA or generate interrupts can have these features turned off for simple, user-level device drivers.User-level VME-bus device drivers are convenient for determining whether a device responds to the correct address or simple register tests. They can also be useful for prototyping: you can quickly integrate boards whose interrupts can be turned off into a system, then later write a kernel-level driver that turns the interrupts back on for higher performance. In addition, you can use a user-level VME-bus device driver in real applications that require low-overhead access to on-board device registers or memory.A user-level VME-bus device driver might typically handle data acquisition hardwarename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'hardware that reads large amounts of data into device memory. Because the device memory is memory-mapped into the address space of the user program, it is available to the user program directly; the user program can avoid copying the data into host memory, processing the data in the device memory instead. However, these PIO accesses may have substantially lower performance than DMA-based kernel drivers. Refer to IDREF="21375" TYPE="TITLE""Programmed I/O (PIO)".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="29260"Kernel-level VME Device DriverYou must write a kernel-level device driver for a VME device that is interrupt-driven or that requires DMA. See ID="chap318"IDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," for a description of the IRIX device driver interface.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="29870"Kernel-level General Memory-mapping Device DriverIf you want to write a driver that lets users access the VME device as memory in user space and also supports DMA and interrupts, you cannot use the general-purpose VME device driver. Instead, you must write a kernel-level device driver of the general memory-mapping model. Likewise, if you need an efficient way to share main memory between a kernel driver and a user program, you must write a device driver of the general memory-mapping model.ID="chap319"The general memory-mapping model is a kernel-level device driver similar to the user-level memory-mapped device driver described above. See IDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," for a general description of kernel-level device drivers. See IDREF="12573" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 7, "Writing Kernel-level General Memory-mapping Device Drivers," for a description of the memory mapping facilities.LBL="" HELPID=""Writing ID="27051"User-level VME Device DriversThe IRIX operating system contains special files in /dev/vme/vme* that provide access to the various address spaces on the system's VME-bus adapters. These special files allow a user-level program to map arbitrary VME devices into its address space. You can take advantage of them to write a user-level memory-mapped device driver.Byte addresses in /dev/vme/vme* are interpreted as VME-bus addresses. Not all addresses can be read from or written to because of read-only or write-only registers and unequipped addresses. Reads or writes to invalid VME-bus addresses normally result in a SIGBUS signal being sent to the offending process. If multiple processes have the mapping for the VME address that got an error, a SIGBUS signal is sent to each of them. On multiprocessor systems, a write to an invalid VME-bus address behaves differently from one on a single-processor system. In these cases, since writes are asynchronous, processors do not wait for the completion of the write operation. If a write operation fails, it may take up to 10 milliseconds for the user VME process to be signaled about a failed write. (VME-bus time-out is about 80 microseconds.) So, if the user VME process has to confirm the successful completion of a write, it should wait for about 10 milliseconds. If the user VME process has already terminated by the time the kernel gets the VME write error interrupt, it sends a message to SYSLOG indicating the VME adapter number and failed VME-bus address.When your driver maps a device into the address space of a user-level program (through the mmap() system call), the user-level program can use simple loads and stores to and from program variables to read or modify device registers or to read or set on-board device memory. If you use memory mapping, you do not need to modify any irix.sm files.Recall that mmapped device drivers are slave devices in which the hardware is memory mapped into a user's address space. No interrupt or DMA service routine is available to the user process.ID="chap320"The special files found in /dev/vme/* are named in the format:/dev/vme/vme<adapter-#><address-space><address-mode>Argumentsadapter-#specifies which VME-bus adapteraddress-spacespecifies which address space, such as 16, 24, or 32(see IDREF="29660" TYPE="TITLE""VME-bus Space Reserved for Customer Drivers".)address-modeidentifies the addressing mode, which is n for non-privileged or s for supervisorUse the ID="chap321"hinv(1M) (hardware inventory) command to produce a list of valid VME-bus adapters present on the system. Adapter numbers range upwards from 0. These adapters can be used only for memory mapping VME-bus address space into the address space of a user's program. The address space can be 16, 24 or 32. The address mode is either n for non-privileged or s for supervisory. Thus, adapter 0, address space 16 in non-privileged mode is referred to as /dev/vme/vme0a16n.Use the technical specification for the device to determine the slave addressing mode.ID="chap322"ID="chap323"The kernel driver for user-level VME is referred to as usrvme. If VME buses are added to an existing system, it may be necessary to run MAKEDEV(1M), specifying a target of usrvme, to have the additional /dev/vme devices created.LBL="" HELPID=""Example VME Device DriverThe following code sample uses the user-level VME-bus interface to perform bus probes:#include <sys/types.h>

}LBL="" HELPID=""Using mmapID="chap324"After you have reconfigured the system correctly, the user-level driver can open the special file for a generic VME device /dev/vme/vme*. To map in the device, the user program must use the mmap() system call. For example:#include "fcntl.h"
#include "sys/mman.h"
fd = open("/dev/vme/vme0a16s", O_RDWR);
addr = mmap(
         0, len, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, off);The mmap() routine maps len bytes starting at (VME-bus) address off to the user virtual address addr. The prot argument is a bit mask that indicates the protection that the operating system enforces on access to the device memory. Thus, PROT_WRITE allows writing; PROT_READ allows reading. The flags argument can be either MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED when used with hardware devices (currently, /dev/vme/vme* makes no distinction between the two). These symbolic constants are defined in sys/mman.hID="chap325". See the IDREF="mmap(D2)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="mmap(D2)"mmap(D2)
 man page for further information on the use of this system call.Once the mmap call succeeds, reads and writes from the user virtual address addr for a length of len bytes result in the appropriate reads and writes for the VME device pointed to by the file descriptor fd.NoteThere is protection on a page boundary only. Even if the user-level program maps in less than a page, the entire page of device registers remains accessible to the user program. Use ID="chap326"getpagesize(2) to determine the page size of the system.ID="chap327"The amount of VME address space that can be mapped into user address space depends on two factors: VME address space type (A16, A24, A32) hardware platformFor VME A16 address space, the entire 64 KB of A16-VME address space is mappable to user virtual address space.For A24 address space, only 8 MB of the 16 MB of address space, starting at VME address 0x80000000, is mappable to the user virtual address space. The kernel reserves the remaining 8 MB of address space to support DMA transfers from A24 masters.For A32 address space, there is some variation according to hardware platform. CHALLENGE/Onyx systems support up to five VME buses. Users can map in a maximum of 96 MB of A32 address space on each VME bus. NoteMapping should be performed in 8 MB increments: Each mmap() system call can map a maximum of 8 MB of VME address space into user virtual address space, so eight such mmap() calls are needed to map the entire 96 MB of VME address space available.This 96 MB of VME address space is shared between the kernel and user-level device drivers. Any installed kernel-level VME device drivers that use VME address space reduce the amount of VME address space available for mapping by the user-level drivers.On other IRIS platforms (IP5/7/9/17), a maximum of 256 MB can be mapped into user virtual address space. On these platforms, mmap() can support mapping in the entire 256 MB of VME address space in a single system call. On systems with dual VME buses, however, the amount of VME address space available for mapping is reduced by half.See IDREF="34630" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix A for further details of what A32 address space is available for customer boards.LBL="" HELPID=""Accessing Mapped SpaceVME accesses are sensitive to the access size, so extra caution is called for once VME address space is mapped into a user's virtual space. For example, A16D8 boards may support only 8-bit accesses, while A16D16 boards may support both 8-bit and 16-bit accesses. Similarly, A32D32 may support only 32-bit accesses or may support 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit accesses. User-level device drivers should ensure that the data structures onto which the VME address space is mapped generate the proper size of transaction on the VME bus.LBL="" HELPID=""VME-bus Error Handling for User-level Device DriversBus errors can occur when a read or write on the VME times out. This can be triggered by user-level drivers accessing a mapped VME space for which no controller exists, or if the controller fails to respond.CautionIf the kernel cannot determine whether the bus error is harmless to the system, the system panics.Read ErrorsIf a VME-bus read error is triggered by a user-level VME driver, the driver process receives a SIGBUS signal. If the driver needs to be aware of the error, then it can catch the signal and take appropriate action. Read errors are synchronous, so the user process can get a definite idea of what PC or routine caused the error.Write ErrorsVME-bus write errors are asynchronous: when a user-level driver writes to the mapped VME address space, the CPU does not stall at that address, but continues executing further instructions. Since the write error time-out bus takes up to 80 microseconds on a VME bus and another finite amount of time for handling the error interrupt from the VME bus, handling write errors can be complicated.A bad VME write error results in a SIGBUS signal being sent to the offending process, if that process is still running on the system. Since it takes a finite amount of time to send the signal to the user-level driver process that triggers a bad VME write, it is essential for the user-level driver to wait for up to 10 milliseconds before exiting. However, this is only necessary before exiting the system (to allow for the handling of the last few bad writes) or when the user process wants to assure that the write completed. It is not necessary to wait for 10 milliseconds after every VME write.LBL="" HELPID=""User-level DMA Library (udmalib)A user-level interface for VME drivers provides access to DMA engines on CHALLENGE/Onyx (IP19) and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx (IP21) hardware platforms. This interface is meant to be used when performance is critical and the VME-bus board itself does not support DMA. Users can move data between a buffer and a VME-bus board faster with a DMA engine than with normal PIO operations. However, because there is only one DMA engine per VME bus on the CHALLENGE series, the DMA engine is a scarce resource. The user-level DMA support library ID="chap328"udmalib allocates the DMA engine exclusively to the first user to request it, and no other user can access it until the current user frees it up.

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="76966"Writing Kernel-level VME Device DriversLBL="" HELPID=""ID="36604"Determining VME Device AddressesEach VME device has a set of VME-bus addresses to which it responds. These addresses correspond to device registers or on-board memory, depending on the VME device. Your driver can map these VME addresses into the host processor address space: your users can access the device with simple reads and writes. VME devices can be classified as A16, A24, A32, or A64 VME slaves. Each class specifies a range of addresses to which the device responds. You determine the slave addressing mode from the technical specification for the device.ID="chap336"ID="chap337"ID="chap338"ID="chap339"Once you determine the addressing mode, choose VME addresses that do not conflict with existing VME device drivers. For each slave addressing class, Silicon Graphics has reserved a range of addresses for use by user-written drivers. These ranges are listed in /var/sysgen/system/irix.sm and tabulated in IDREF="34630" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix A, "System-specific Issues".You must choose a VME-bus interrupt priority level for the device. The VME-bus interrupt priority level must be a value from one to seven. Later, all VME interrupts are channeled into one CPU interrupt level. The priority of this CPU interrupt is below that of the clock and any on-CPU devices.In the past, it was necessary to reserve a VME interrupt vector. Since most VME devices can program the interrupt vector through software, a dynamic allocation scheme for vectors now hands VME vectors out to drivers at initialization time. However, if your VME device has a hard-wired or jumpered VME vector, it is still possible to reserve the VME vector that the device requires.When CPU interrupts are assigned to the VME bus, the CPU services the VME-bus interrupts in order of their VME-bus priority. For each CPU interrupt, the system services only one device per VME-bus priority level. If more than one VME-bus interrupt occurs at the same VME-bus interrupt priority level, all but one device must wait until the next time the CPU services the VME-bus CPU interrupt.After picking an appropriate set of addresses and an interrupt priority level, you must program the VME device to respond accordingly. Usually, you do this with jumpers or switches. Some VME devices allow you to program the VME vector and interrupt priority level at boot time (from your driver's drvedtinit() routine).If the device performs DMA, you need to know the addressing mode by which the device accesses main memory. This addressing mode is called its ID="chap340"master addressing mode, as opposed to the ID="chap341"slave addressing mode described above. Silicon Graphics supports A24, A32, and A64R4000 ≠ R4400 use 64-bit MIPS III mode in the CHALLENGE/Onyx chassis.
 VME master addressing. (POWERchannel-2 has master DMA capability.) The master addressing mode determines the driver structure to some degree.ID="chap342"ID="chap343"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="40037"Including VME Device Drivers in the KernelIDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," provides general information on adding a driver to the kernel. This section describes specifics concerning VME drivers.To add a new kernel-level device driver, you must create your own irix.sm file that contains the appropriate directive telling lboot how to include your driver. The filename, which must end with ".sm", belongs in the directory ID="chap344"/var/sysgen/systemID="chap345". Because lboot can probe for VME devices, lboot can conditionally include a VME device driver into the kernel.If the current system contains the VME device, lboot includes the driver; otherwise, it saves memory by leaving it out. Use the VECTOR directive to include a VME device conditionally. In addition to the module name, the VECTORID="chap346" directive requires that you fill out these fields:adapterThe adapter number identifying which VME bus out of possibly several.bustypeThis must be set to VME.ctlrThe device number that differentiates between more than one device of the same type.exprobe_spaceThis is an extended probe that can do reads and writes with compares against expected values to search for a VME device at an address. The first arg defines a sequence of reads and writes. The second arg specifies the address space. The third arg specifies the probe address. The fourth arg is the size of the probe, 1-4 bytes. The fifth arg is the expected read or write value. The last argument is a mask that the fifth arg is ANDed against.iospace, iospace2, iospace3This is a triple identifying a VME-bus space, address, and size. The bus space is one of A16NP, A16S, A24NP, A24S, A32NP, A32S.iplThe VME interrupt priority level. This must be a value from 1 to 7, as described above.probe_spaceThis is a triple identifying a VME-bus space, address, and read byte count. The address specified is read by lboot to determine the existence of device. If you do not specify a probe address, the module is automatically included in the kernel.vectorThe VME interrupt vector value. This must not be used unless the VME device has hard-wired or jumpered vector values.You must also create a master file under /var/sysgen/master.d. A master file has four sections:a tabulated ordering of flagsphrases and values interpreted by the configuration program and used to build device tablesa list of stub routinesa section of C code.The first, non-blank, non-comment line is interpreted for flags, phrases, and values. Other non-comment lines that follow, up to a line that begins with a dollar sign, specify stubs. Anything that follows the line beginning with a dollar sign is processed to interpret special characters, then compiled into the kernel.The name of the master file is the same as the name of the object file for the driver, but the master file must not have the .o suffix. The FLAG field of the master file must include at least the character device flag c. (You do not need the s flag for VME device drivers because lboot can probe for VME devices.) See /var/sysgen/master.d/README and the master(4) man page.NoteFor network drivers, the FLAG field would blank with a "-" (hyphen).As an example, suppose you want to add a mythical VME device driver to the kernel. You must copy the driver object file vdk.o to /var/sysgen/boot, and you must add a line similar to the following to a file called vdk.sm in /var/sysgen/system:VECTOR: bustype=VME module=vdk ipl=1 ctlr=0 adapter=0 iospace=(A16S,0x400,0x200) iospace2=(A16S,0x800,0x100) probe_space=(A16S,0x404,2)NoteThe above lines must all be on one line in the irix.sm file.Note that the bus addresses and sizes are specified in hexadecimal format. The ctlr= value helps identify a device when more than one uses the same driver. If there is more than one device, give each a unique number, starting from zero. In the above example, lboot reads two bytes at probe address 0x404 to determine whether the device is present.After examining /usr/include/sys/major.h, you determine that major device number 51 is available and can be used for this device. You then create a master file vdk in /var/sysgen/master.d, and enter:*FLAG     PREFIX    SOFT      #DEV       DEPENDENCIES

ID="chap347"LBL="" HELPID=""Writing edtinit()If you use the VECTOR directive to configure a driver into the kernel, your driver can use a routine of the form drvedtinit(), where drv is the driver prefix.

In general, you can use your drvedtinit() routine to perform any device driver initialization you want.Synopsisdrvedtinit(e)

};Based on e_bus_type, lboot will set up e_bus_info to point to the corresponding bus-dependent data structure (that is, vme_intrs). With this two-layer structure, it is easier to extend edt to support EISA, GIO, or other types of buses.CHALLENGE/Onyx and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx systems can support more I/O address space than the kernel can, so it is necessary to provide a way of allocating only the part of the I/O space that is needed into the kernel address space. Programming the I/O board/adapter registers dynamically assigns the mapping. The edt structure must describe the device by adapter ID and adapter bus address. The kernel uses this information to initialize the kernel virtual address.On POWER Series workstations, ranges of VME-bus address space are mapped one-to-one with K2 segment addresses. This makes accessing the VME bus easy, but is also limiting. Only a small amount of K2 space is available for use by VME, so very little of the VME address space is made available. Even worse, for dual VME-bus systems, the space previously available is now halved because the two buses must share it. The CHALLENGE series supports up to five VME buses. Since K2 space is a limited resource, and dividing up what is available by five makes the extra VME buses next to useless, a new approach was tried. The CHALLENGE series does not have a direct K2 address map into VME-bus space. Each VME-bus adapter has the ability to map fifteen 8 MB windows of VME-bus space into K2 space. These windows can be moved around at will to give the illusion of a much larger address space.To access a VME space, a user must allocate a PIO map, which provides a translation between a kernel address and VME space. These mappings can be "FIXED" or "UNFIXED." As on POWER Series platforms, a FIXED mapping is a one-to-one mapping of a range of VME-bus space into the driver's address space. An UNFIXED window takes advantage of the sliding window ability on the CHALLENGE series, which supports both FIXED and UNFIXED mappings. In an UNFIXED map, VME-bus space cannot be accessed directly; instead, access is provided through special bcopy() routines used to move data between VME space and kernel buffers. While it is not always possible to get a FIXED mapping, an UNFIXED mapping is always available. The special bcopy() routines work for both FIXED and UNFIXED mappings. On POWER Series and earlier workstations, UNFIXED mappings are treated as FIXED mappings.The PIO mapping routines also have a general interface that allows them to be used for mapping in bus spaces other than VME.The support routines for PIO mapping are:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_mapallocLEFT="90" WIDTH="252"Allocate a PIO map.LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_mapaddrLEFT="90" WIDTH="252"Map bus space to a driver accessible address (FIXED

The lineVECTOR: module=XXX intrcpu=3directs lboot (via ID="chap348"autoconfig) to set the v_intrcpu field for the module's edt struct to 3 and the v_setintrcpu field to 1, indicating that v_intrcpu is valid. If no intrcpu= statement appears in the VECTOR line, v_setintrcpu is set to 0. The module's edtinit function may then use these fields to route interrupts as desired.void

This lets you write a driver that is prepared if the device is removed from the system after the kernel has been built or when the kernel runs on another system.Continuing with this mythical VME device driver example, its drvedtinit() routine could look like:struct drvctlrinfo ctlrinfo[MAXCTLR];

}Two new routines vme_ivec_alloc(uint_t, adapter) and vme_ivec_set(adapter, vec, intr_func, arg) are implemented to dynamically allocate an interrupt vector and register this vector into vme_ivec(). This scheme supports multiple vectors and loadable drivers. ID="chap349"vme_ivec_alloc() and vme_ivec_set() are used in an edtinit routine; vme_ivec_free() can be called to free up a vector that has been allocated.You can specify the vector in the irix.sm file for old VME boards with a hard-wired interrupt vector. 0x30-0x3f and 0x70-0x7f are reserved for customer boards.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="14468"VME Interrupt HandlerYour driver module must contain a routine of the form drvintr(), where drv is the driver prefix. When the device generates an interrupt, the general VME interrupt handler calls your driver's drvintr() routine.When the VME interrupt handler calls your drvintr(), it passes it the value registered with the vme_ivec_set() routine for the device. Within your drvintr() routine, you must set flags to indicate the state of the transfer and to wake any sleeping processes waiting for the transfer to complete. Usually, the interrupt routine calls biodone() to indicate that an I/O transfer for the buffer is complete.CautionInterrupt routines (drvintr()) must not try to sleep themselves by using biowait(), sleep(), psema(), or delay() kernel calls.With the new dynamic interrupt vector allocation scheme, the argument passed to the individual drvintr() is arg, which is set by vme_ivec_set() in edtinit(). arg can be an index, a controller number, the address, or any argument that the driver wants to pass to interrupt the service routine.The IRIX 5.x and 6.0 vme_ivec structure is shown below:struct vme_ivec {
    int   (*vm_intr)(int);
    int    vm_arg;
}vme_ivec[ADAPTER][MAX_VME_VECTS];NoteAlthough the prototype for the VME interrupt handler routine in the vme_intrs (field v_vintr) and vme_ivec (field vintr) structures indicates that it returns an integer value, the return value is not used. The prototype should indicate that the function is of type void*. It was left unchanged to avoid breaking existing VME device drivers.To support the loadable device drivers, multiple adapters, and multiple interrupt vectors, the vem_ivec table is changed to be dynamically allocated at system boot time. The size depends on the number of VME adapters currently supported by the running system. After the table is allocated, the kernel fills the entries for the devices specified in the irix.sm file.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="21375"Programmed I/O (PIO)When transferring large amounts of data, your device driver should use direct memory access (DMA). Using DMA, your driver can program a few registers, return, and put itself to sleep while it awaits an interrupt that indicates the transfer is complete. This frees up the processor for use by other processes. See the ID="chap350"ID="chap351"ID="chap352"IDREF="ioctl(2)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="ioctl(2)"ioctl(D2)
 man page.Sometimes you must write a driver for a device that does not support DMA. Even if the device does support DMA, you may not want to use DMA to transfer amounts of data so small as not to warrant the DMA overhead.In these cases, the host processor usually copies the data from the user space to on-board memory. Your driver can then program the device registers to notify the device that the memory is ready. The device controller can then copy the data from its on-board memory to the peripheral device.Listed below is part of a mythical VME device driver for a printer controller that does not support DMA.To print data from the user, the driver copies data from the user's buffer to an on-board memory buffer of size VDK_MEMSIZE. Following the copy of each chunk, the driver programs the device register to indicate the size of valid data in memory and to tell the controller to start printing.The driver then sleeps, waiting for an interrupt to indicate that the printing is complete and that the on-board memory buffer is available again.

}The driver's use of the volatile declaration informs the optimizer that this variable points to a hardware value that may change. Otherwise, the optimizer may determine that one write to vdk_device->command or storage of the value in a register is sufficient. NoteIf your driver uses the ID="chap356"sleep() and wakeupID="chap357"() kernel routines to sleep and awaken, it is a good idea for the top half to verify that the event has occurred before awakening the sleeping process. (See IDREF="sleep(D3)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="sleep(D3)"sleep(D3)
 for details on the sleep/wakeup process synchronization mechanism.) If your driver uses the biowait()/biodone() routines or the psema()/vsema() routines to sleep and awaken, you need not worry about its awakening by accident. However, the routines psema() and vsema() are specific to IRIX and are probably not supported on other operating systems.The uiomove() kernel routine is a useful procedure to call in these situations because it automatically updates uio and iovec structures while checking for valid user addresses. Remember that uiop->uio_resid must be left with the number of bytes remaining untransferred.Noteuiomove() uses bcopy() to transfer data. bcopy() transfers data as fast as possible between locations in system memory. bcopy() takes advantage of CPU-specific commands to optimize performance. On the R4000 processor, bcopy() tries to move eight bytes at a time. Most VME-bus boards cannot move data eight bytes at a time, so using this routine directly may not work. A work-around would be to use uiomove() to copy the data from a user buffer into a kernel buffer, then to use pio_bcopy() to copy the data from the kernel buffer to the VME-bus board. pio_bcopy() allows the user to specify the element size being transferred.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="10599"DMA OperationsAs indicated in IDREF="21375" TYPE="TITLE""Programmed I/O (PIO)," use DMA (direct memory access) when the device supports it. In its simplest form, DMA is easy to use: your driver gives the device the physical memory address, and the transaction begins. Your driver can then put itself to sleep while it waits for the transfer to complete, thus freeing the processor for other tasks. When the transfer is complete, the device interrupts the processor. On most systems, when large amounts of data are involved, DMA devices obtain higher overall throughput than devices that do only PIO.DMA operations are categorized as ID="chap358"ID="chap359"DMA readsID="chap360" or ID="chap361"DMA writesID="chap362". DMA operations that transfer from memory to a device, and hence read memory, are DMA reads. DMA operations that transfer from a device to memory are DMA writes. Thus, you may want to think of DMA operations as being named the from the point of view of what happens to memory. There are important cache considerations for drivers using DMA. The cache architecture of the system dictates the appropriate cache operations. Write back caches require that data be written back from cache to memory before a DMA write, whereas both write back and write through caches require the cache to be invalidated before data from a DMA read is used. See IDREF="12969" TYPE="TITLE""Data Cache Write Back and Invalidation" in Appendix A and the IDREF="dki_dcache_wbinval(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="dki_dcache_wbinval(D3X)"dki_dcache_wbinval(D3X)
 man page for a discussion of these issues.ID="chap363"Another concern for driver writers is that DMA buffers may require cache-line alignment. If a driver allocates a buffer for DMA, it must use the kmem_allocID="chap364"() function, using the KM_CACHEALIGN flag.The interrupt service routine then calls your drvintr() routine. Your drvintr() routine can check that the transfer is complete (if necessary), set flags indicating the status of the transfer, and then awaken the sleeping process.Unfortunately, the details of how you implement the simple scheme described above is complicated by the use of virtual memory, different VME addressing modes, and a variety of device and system implementations. To sort through these potentially confusing choices, ask the following questions in order. If the answer to any question is "yes," go on to the section indicated. Otherwise, proceed to the next question.LBL="" HELPID=""A32 Addressing Scatter/Gather SupportModern computer architectures support ID="chap365"ID="chap366"virtual memoryname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

Because VME devices understand only physical page addresses, your driver would ordinarily be forced to do transfers one page at a time. At the start of each one-page transfer, your driver would have to awaken the sleeping process and compute the physical address for the next virtual page.ID="chap367"Because this is not efficient, many devices now provide a method to store the address mapping for the entire transfer up front. Your driver can usually do this merely by programming the device with a table of physical addresses for all of the upcoming transfer. This method of regrouping of noncontiguous physical memory is called ID="chap368"scatter/gather.If your VME device supports scatter/gather, uses A32 addressing, has less than 4 GB of physical memory, and you are not on a CHALLENGE/Onyx series system, proceed to IDREF="29011" TYPE="TITLE""VME Devices with Scatter/Gather Capability."LBL="" HELPID=""DMA Mapping for High-end Systems and Older SystemsOlder Silicon Graphics systems and current high-end systems provide for address mapping of physical addresses so that even devices that do not support scatter/gather in the controller can transfer to and from noncontiguous physical pages with ease. This facility, called ID="chap369"DMA mapping, is available on 4D/100 through 4D/400, Crimson, CHALLENGE/Onyx and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx series systems. Indigo, Indigo2, and Indy workstations have no VME-bus support. DMA mapping works equally well for both VME A24 and A32 master addressing. See IDREF="16918" TYPE="TITLE""Using DMA Maps" for a description of how to use DMA mapping.LBL="" HELPID=""Does the VME Device Perform A24 Master Addressing?If the VME device uses A24 addressing, and your system does not support DMA mapping, the controller can access only the first 8 MB of physical memory. Because user programs may use physical pages beyond 8 MB, your device driver must do DMA into a kernel buffer and copy from that buffer to the user's pages. See IDREF="93039" TYPE="TITLE""DMA on A24 Devices with No DMA Mapping."LBL="" HELPID=""A32 Addressing with No Scatter/GatherIf you are writing a driver for an A32 VME device that does not support scatter/gather on a workstation that does not support DMA mapping, see ID="chap370"IDREF="18725" TYPE="TITLE""DMA on A32 Devices with No Scatter/Gather Capability" for advice on how to implement this driver type.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="29011"VME Devices with Scatter/Gather CapabilityIDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," tells you to use the physiock() kernel routine to fault in and lock the physical pages corresponding to the user's buffer. physiock() also remaps these physical pages to a kernel virtual address that remains constant even when the user's virtual addresses are no longer mapped.Internally, physiock() allocates a structure of type buf if you pass a NULL pointer (physiock() uses this structure to embody the transfer information). physiock() then calls your drvstrategy() routine and passes it a pointer to the buf type structure that it has allocated and primed. Your drvstrategy() routine must then loop through each page, starting at the kernel virtual address, and load each device scatter/gather register in turn with the corresponding physical address. Use the kvtophys() routine to convert a kernel virtual address to a physical address.For example, suppose the mythical device is now an A32 VME device that supports scatter/gather. The scatter/gather registers for the device are simply a table of integers that store the physical pages corresponding to the current transfer. To start the transfer, the driver gives the device the beginning byte offset, byte count, and transfer direction. The code is:ID="chap371"#include <sys/sysmacros.h>

Because the addresses that are mapped are really no longer "physical" addresses, they are now referred to as "bus virtual" addresses. Your driver should allocate these system mapping registers when it opens the device, remap these registers for every transfer, and then free them when it closes the device.ID="chap372"Internally, all the mapping routines deal with a DMA map structure. The values stored in members of the structure are subject to change from release to release. Therefore, when your driver manipulates the DMA maps, it must use the following routines only.

Silicon Graphics workstations that support the VME bus provide a DMA mapping capability so that your driver can access all of physical memory. Some Silicon Graphics systems allow A24 masters to access only the first 8 MB of physical memory. Your driver must declare a static buffer assigned to contiguous physical pages in low memory, and it must do DMA transfers to and from this buffer only. After a transfer is complete, the driver can copy the data from this buffer to the user's memory. Because kernel static data uses contiguous physical memory pages, scatter/gather hardware is not needed. Keep this buffer no more than a few pages long; otherwise, the kernel BSS segment may be too large for the system to boot it. The limits on kernel size vary from system to system and sometimes across releases and other included kernel drivers.Using a DMA read operation, your driver can transfer data from a device directly to physical memory. Any words in the processor data cache corresponding to this memory are now stale. To invalidate the data cache lines associated with the physical memory addresses, your driver must call the ID="chap375"dki_dcache_inval() routine. If your driver calls the kernel routine, physiock(), it need not call ID="chap376"dki_dcache_inval() because physiock() calls the ID="chap377"userdma() routine and thus invalidates the data cache.Using a DMA write operation, your driver can transfer data from memory to the device. Prior to the transfer, any words in the processor data cache corresponding to this memory may be more up-to-date than the corresponding memory. In this case, memory is said to be stale with respect to cache, and any words in the cache corresponding to this memory must be written back to memory before the DMA starts. Use the dki_dcache_wbinvalID="chap378"() routine to write the contents of the cache back to memory. If your driver calls the kernel routine physiock(), it need not call dki_dcache_wbinval() because physiock() calls the userdma() routine and thus writes back and invalidates the data cache.The driver below does a DMA transfer into memory that has not been prepared by physiock(). The driver can do this because the data is in a kernel buffer, so there is no need to lock it in memory and remap it. See IDREF="34630" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix A, "System-specific Issues," for more information on data cache management.For example, suppose the mythical VME device is now an A24 master. The driver begins the transfer by programming the starting address, byte count, and transfer direction.ID="chap379"NoteOn systems with multiple word cache lines, this buffer must be aligned on a cache line boundary for correct operation. Normally, some extra bytes (currently 128) must be allocated, and a pointer into the buffer, whose address is adjusted to be cache-line aligned, must be used (see SCACHE_ALIGNED in sys/immu.h).Alternatively, allocate a buffer during the drvedtinit routine with kmem_alloc and the SCACHE_ALIGN flag, and verify that the address is in the low 8 MB of physical memory with kvtophys().A driver excerpt follows:#define V DKBUFSIZE 4096 /* kernel buffer size */

It expands the ISA data bus from 16 bits to 32 bits and adds 23 address lines and 16 indicator and control lines.ID="chap41"The EISA bus supports:All ISA transfers (except ISA-bus masters)EISA-bus master devicesBurst-mode DMA transfers32-bit memory data and address pathPeer-to-peer card communicationDynamic bus sizing (that is, 32-bit bus master to 16-bit memory)LBL="" HELPID=""InitializationA central component of the DOS-EISA world is a configuration program that allocates and sets up the resources that the EISA card uses. Once this program runs, the configuration results are downloaded into non-volatile memory for future driver use. Storing the configuration results serves two purposes:The stored results make it easy for drivers to operate as boot devices because the drivers can initialize in a standalone environment, in which the operating system is not up and able to allocate resources to the driver. But, because the Silicon Graphics EISA environment does not now support booting from EISA devices, saving the resource allocation information in nonvolatile RAM is superfluous.DOS saves the configuration file to store a set of card register programmatic instructions that initialize various I/O ports. This is useful when writing a generic device driver that must control boards that have different initialization registers but are basically the same, even though they come from different manufacturers.NoteAlthough Silicon Graphics does not support this functionality, it should not cause any problems because you can write the driver initialization routine to check the product ID and execute the appropriate initialization code. Be sure to consider the byte order when checking the product ID.In the DOS environment, the EISA configuration program allocates memory spaces, DMA channels, and interrupt request lines. In IRIX release 5.x, lboot handles the allocation of memory and I/O spaces. lboot passes the allocation results to the driver via the edt_t structure. Memory and I/O spaces are passed via edt, but dynamic resources are not. The driver requests DMA channels and interrupt request lines or queues (IRQs) as dynamic resources as required.ID="chap42"LBL="" HELPID=""EISA-Bus Locked CyclesThe EISA bus provides a locked cycle that allows users to read/write the contents of a device register or memory location as an atomic operation. This facility is normally implemented for semaphores' bit test-and-set operations.On the Indigo2, the hardware implementation of a locked cycle is limited. Indigo2 allows an EISA card to issue a locked cycle, but only for the duration of two contiguous read/write operations. Access to this class of cycles is provided on the CPU side, much like the read/modify/write cycle on a VME bus, through the pio_rmw* kernel functions. See IDREF="79991" TYPE="TITLE""Writing a Kernel-level EISA Device Driver."In general, LOCK* is not considered to be a supported feature of the Silicon Graphics EISA implementation. LBL="" HELPID=""EISA-Bus Request ArbitrationEISA provides server DMA channels arranged into two channel groups (channels 0-3 and channels 5-7) for priority resolution. Silicon Graphics uses the rotating scheme described in the EISA-bus specification. Although the channels rotate in this scheme, channels 5-7 receive more cycles, in general, than channels 0-3.LBL="" HELPID=""EISA-Bus InterruptsThe EISA bus supports 11 edge-triggerable or level-triggerable interrupts. IRQ0≠IRQ2, IRQ8, and IRQ13 are used for internal functions only and are not available externally. The remaining 11 interrupt lines (IRQ3≠IRQ7, IRQ9≠IRQ12, IRQ14, IRQ15) are available for external system interrupts.ID="chap43"On Indigo2, all EISA interrupts are received at the same CPU level. When the CPU receives an EISA-bus interrupt, it responds to each device in IRQ priority order (lower number first). The operating system then determines which interrupt routine to use, based on the value specified by the device driver. Devices may share the same IRQ level.LBL="" HELPID=""EISA-Bus Data TransfersThe EISA bus supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit data transfers through direct CPU access as well as DMA initiated by a bus-master card or the on-board DMA hardware.LBL="" HELPID=""EISA-Bus Address SpaceThe EISA-bus address space is divided into I/O address space and memory address space. I/O address space provides access to the 4 KB page that references the registers on an EISA card on a slot-specific basis and the registers on an ISA card on an address-range basis.The EISA memory space supports memory that is configured to respond to the address range starting at 0xa0000. On Indigo2 systems, the EISA memory address range extends 112 MB up to address 0x06ffffff (see IDREF="61416" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 4-1). Once properly mapped by the operating system, this memory space can be directly accessed by the CPU through loads and stores.FILE="Fig4-1.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="4-1"Figure 4-1 ID="61416"Indigo2 Memory SpaceIRIX release 5.2 and later releases provide a set of procedural interfaces that a device driver must use to allocate and map the EISA I/O address space and memory address space.The Indigo2 has four peripheral card slots that accept EISA, GIO, or graphics cards. A server can support up to four EISA cards, but then a graphics card cannot be used. CHALLENGE M platforms have four EISA slots available. Graphics cards are available that use one, two, or three slots:ID="chap44"With Extreme graphics installed, one slot is available for use by an EISA card.With XZ graphics installed, two slots are used by the graphics, and two are available for EISA cards. The XL graphics uses only one slot, so up to three EISA cards can be accommodated.LBL="" HELPID=""Byte SwappingAn important implementation detail of the EISA bus you need to be aware of is that the EISA bus uses little-endianID="chap45" byte ordering; the CPU running IRIX uses ID="chap46"ID="chap47"big-endian byte ordering. Hence, a byte reference by the CPU to the low-order byte within a word results in a reference to the high-order byte on the EISA bus. This can sometimes become complex when referencing data structures across the bus.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="14376"Choosing a Device Driver ModelYou can control a device connected to the EISA bus through a user-level device driver, a kernel-level device driver, or a kernel-level memory-mapping device driver.The simplest way to access an EISA device is through a user-level driver that controls the device by directly interfacing with the EISA-bus adapter.LBL="" HELPID=""When to Write a User-level Device DriverThere are several reasons why you might want to write a user-level device driver instead of a kernel-level device driver:If your user does not need to use EISA device interrupts or DMA operations.TipOn many EISA boards that generate interrupts or use DMA operations, these features can be disabled so that simple, user-level drivers can be used.It is more convenient to write a user-level EISA-bus device driver to determine whether a device is responding to the correct address or simple register tests.TipThis can be very useful for prototyping: you can quickly integrate boards into a system with the interrupts turned off, then later write a kernel-level driver that uses interrupts or DMA operations for better performance.You can use a user-level device driver in real applications that require low-overhead access to on-board device registers or memory.LBL="" HELPID=""When to Write a Kernel-level Device DriverThe main reasons for writing a kernel-level device driver are:You must use interrupts to access the EISA device.You must use DMA operations to transfer data from/to the EISA device.LBL="" HELPID=""When to Write a Kernel-level Memory-mapping Device DriverThe main reasons for writing a kernel-level memory-mapping device driver are:You need a driver that allows the user to access the EISA device as memory in user space yet also supports DMA and interrupts.You need an efficient way to share main memory between a kernel driver and a user program.See IDREF="12573" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 7, "Writing Kernel-level General Memory-mapping Device Drivers," for a description of the memory-mapping facilities.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="60512"Writing a User-level EISA Device DriverA typical application for a user-level EISA-bus device driver is to handle data acquisition hardware (that is, hardware that reads large amounts of data into device memory). Because the device memory is available to the user program directly (it is "mmapped" into the address space of the user program), the user program can avoid copying the data into host memory and can process the data in the device memory instead. However, on some systems, this PIO access may have substantially lower performance than DMA-based kernel drivers.LBL="" HELPID=""User-level EISA Special FilesIRIX Release 5.x contains special files in the /dev/eisa directory that allow a user-level program to map arbitrary EISA or ISA devices into its address space. These files can be used to write a user-level memory-mapped device driver. The driver uses the mmap() system call to map the card's address space into user-level program address space. Then the driver can access the card through simple loads and stores of program variables.The special device files found in the /dev/eisa directory are:eisaAioEISA-bus adapter's 64 KB I/O address spaceeisaAmemEISA-bus adapter's 112 MB memory address spaceWhere A is the specific EISA-bus adapter.An Indigo2 system has a single EISA-bus slot, so its special device files are limited to eisa0io and eisa0mem.LBL="" HELPID=""Using the mmap Operating System FunctionA user-level driver may access a generic EISA device by opening the appropriate /dev/eisa special file, followed by an mmap() call to map in the device. For example:int fd, len, off;
char *addr;
fd=open("/dev/eisa/eisa0io", O_RDWR);
len=4096;
off=0x1000;
addr=mmap(0, len, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, off);
 .
 .
 .
/* addr can be used to access any card register by adding the 
 * appropriate offset and then dereferencing the pointer
 */
 .
 .
 .Note that in the example above, the offset starts at 0X1000, which is the base address of the first EISA slot. On Indigo2 systems, the slots are numbered in ascending order from top to bottom (that is, slot one is the top and slot four is on the bottom.). See the IDREF="mmap(D2)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="mmap(D2)"mmap(D2)
 man page for a complete description of this system call.The mmap() routine maps len bytes starting at EISA address off to the user virtual address addr. Any loads or stores to the address range addr to addr+len will result in read or writes to the EISA I/O space. NoteYou are responsible for identifying the offset to reference each device on a slot-specific basis. The offset must be incremented by 4096 to reference the next EISA card's I/O space; the offset to an ISA card is its ISA address.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="79991"Writing a Kernel-level EISA Device DriverThis section provides in-depth information about data structures and drivers that interface through the kernel to the EISA bus. It describes system configuration for EISA device drivers and introduces several driver initialization routines.LBL="" HELPID=""Configuring a Kernel-level EISA Device DriverTo configure a kernel-level EISA device driver, you must add certain system files to the kernel, create various data structures, and write the driver.LBL="" HELPID=""File RequirementsThe following files must be created or modified from existing models and added to the kernel:A system file with a directive telling lboot, the configuration utility, how to include your driver and specify which memory space your device will allocate. This is installed into /var/sysgen/system directory using the driver name appended by ".sm". See IDREF="57387" TYPE="TITLE""Including EISA Drivers in the Kernel," for information on what to include in this file.A master file under /var/sysgen/master.d. The name of the master file is the same as the name of the object file for the driver, but the master file must not have the .o suffix.Copy the driver object file (the .o file) to /var/sysgen/boot.LBL="" HELPID=""Determining ISA/EISA Device AddressesThe I/O address space on an EISA card plugged into a card slot responds to the range of bus addresses for that slot. All EISA cards are identified by a manufacturer-specific device ID that the operating system uses to register the existence of each card. ISA cards, in contrast, are jumpered to respond to a specific address range that corresponds to the device's I/O registers.Your driver can map these I/O addresses into the host processor address space; it can then access these registers with simple reads and writes. For a card's memory space to be accessible, the card must be configured or jumpered to respond to the appropriate address range. The memory space can then be mapped to the host address space with the kernel mapping routines. The specified address range must be selected to avoid conflicts with other EISA/ISA devices.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="57387"Including EISA Drivers in the KernelThis section describes the configuration information needed to add an EISA driver to the kernel. To add a new kernel-level device driver, you must create your own system file. This file should contain the appropriate directive that tells lboot how to include your driver, and it should specify which memory space will be allocated by your device. The filename must include the .sm suffix and reside in the directory /var/sysgen/system. Because lboot can probe for EISA devices, it can conditionally include an EISA device driver into the kernel.LBL="" HELPID=""VECTOR DirectiveThe system file must have a VECTOR: line in it that causes lboot to check whether a hardware device corresponding to the particular module is connected to the system. If the device is found, and a driver exists, it is included in the kernel. SynopsisVECTOR:   bustype=EISA   module=driver_name   [options]ArgumentsbustypeThis must be set to "EISA".moduleThe drivername declares the name of the object file for the driver and its master.d configuration file, respectively, in the /var/sysgen/boot and /var/sysgen/master.d directories.The optional fields that can be appended to the VECTOR: directive are:adapterThe adapter number identifying which EISA bus out of possibly several. Indigo2 systems currently support only a single EISA bus, which is referenced as "adapter=0". You can also use "adapter=*" to reference all possible EISA adapters (as potentially available in future hardware). The default is zero.ctlrThe device number that differentiates between more than one device of the same type. This number is passed to the driver by the edt structure when multiple devices of the same type are connected. Generally, this number has some correspondence to the minor device number.A final set of VECTOR: line options probes for and configures address spaces used by the EISA or ISA card. EISA address space is divided into I/O and memory address space.The VECTOR: line space declarations are a triple of the form:(space_name, address_offset, size)Argumentsspace_nameMust be either EISAIO or EISAMEM (even for ISA cards).address_offset and sizeSpecified in bytes. If the card is an EISA card (as opposed to an ISA card), each card's I/O register space starts at0x1000 (4K) bytes * slot numberand extends the full 0x1000 (4 KB) to the next slot's space. For ISA cards, the I/O space addresses are not slot dependent, but rather card jumper dependent. They can be in the range starting at byte offset 0x100 (256) and extending up to 0x400 (1024). Similarly, the ISA address space size is card dependent and limited only by the ISA address space size. The EISAMEM space can begin at offset 0xa0000 (640 KB) and extend up to 112 MB.The VECTOR: fields that use these space declarations are:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"iospace1iospace2iospace3LEFT="80" WIDTH="261"These space declarations are defined so that the driver can 
map to the registers and memory on the card. Typically, 
iospace1 is used to define the I/O register space to be 
referenced, and iospace2 and iospace3 are used to gain 
access to one or two different on-card memory spaces.exprobe_spaceThere are two different techniques used to probe for the existence of an EISA or ISA card. For an EISA card, a read is compared to an expected value to determine the existence of a particular EISA card in a slot. Thus, probing for an EISA card is done by specifying a VECTOR: line with an exprobe_spaceID="chap48" read if the card's unique manufacturer product identifier at each EISA slot's product IS I/O address. The manufacturer's product ID is a 4-bit quantity that is encoded in a format specified by the EISA bus specification.The general form of exprobe_space allows for a more generalized extensive read/write sequence, which can be used to search for an ISA card at a particular address. The probing is accomplished by writing a value to a register located on the card and then reading it back to verify that a board responds to that location. Do not use a comparison value of 0xff because the bus floats to that value, which would cause the probe command always to believe that it had found a new board.exprobe_space is specified as a six-tuple consisting of:(rwseg, bus_space, address, size, value, mask)rwseg ≠ A sequence of one or more r's or w's indicating a read or write. To test for an EISA card, use a simple r. To test for an ISA card, use wr, which causes the value to be written then reread.bus_space ≠ Either EISAIO or EISAMEM. The manufacturer ID is located in EISAIO space.address ≠ The address offset to read. The manufacturer ID is located at 0xzC80, where z is the slot number for EISA cards. ISA cards must specify the address of a register that can be read from and written to.size ≠ The manufacturer ID is four bytes long, as described below. ISA cards must use the appropriate register width.value ≠ Compressed 4-byte value to look for (EISA). Non-0xff value for ISA.mask ≠ A bit mask to specify which bytes of the value to compare against.LBL="" HELPID=""EISA Product Identifier (ID)EISA expansion boards, embedded devices, and system boards have a four-byte product identifier (ID) that can be read from I/O port addresses 0xzC80 through 0xzC83. For example, the slot 1 product ID can be read from I/O port addresses 0x1C80-0x1C83.The first two bytes (0xzC80 and 0xzC81) contain a compressed representation of the manufacturer code. The manufacturer code is a three-character code (uppercase, ASCII characters in the range of A to Z) chosen by the manufacturer and registered with the firm that distributes the EISA specification.The manufacturer code "ISA" is used to indicate a generic ISA adapter. The three-character manufacturer code is compressed into three 5-bit values so that it can be incorporated into the two I/O bytes at 0xzC80 and 0xzC81, where z represents the slot number probed. The compression procedure is:Find the hexadecimal ASCII value for each letter:ASCII for "A"-"Z" : "A" = 0x41, "Z" = 0x5aSubtract 0x40 from each ASCII value:Compressed "A" = 0x41-0x40 = 0x01 = 0000 0001Compressed "Z" = 0x5a-0x40 = 0x1A = 0001 1010Retain five least significant bits for each letter:Discard three most significant bits (they are always zero)Compressed "A" = 0001. Compressed "Z" = 1010Compressed code = concatenate "0" and the three 5-bit values: "AZA" = 0 00001 11010 00001 (16-bit value)0xzC80 = 00000111, 0xzC81h = 01000001IDREF="97986" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 4-2 shows the format of the product ID (addresses 0xzC80-0xzC83).FILE="Fig4-2.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="4-2"Figure 4-2 ID="97986"Product ID FormatThe manufacturer ID is located at bytes offset 0xzC80-0xzC83, where z represents the slot number probed. exprobe_space usage when searching for an EISA card is:exprobe_space = (r, EISAIO, 0xzC80, 4, mfg_id, 0xffffffff)The first argument (r) specifies that this probe consists of doing a single read. The second argument (EISAIO) declares that the address space is in the EISA register range. 0xzC80 is the offset of the manufacturer's unique ID. The size of this read is four bytes. mfg_id is the compressed 4-byte value that is returned by the particular card being searched for. The last argument is a mask which the mfg_id is ANDed against.In addition to the system file described above, you must create a master file under /var/sysgen/master.d. (The name of the master file is the same as the name of the object file for the driver, but the master file must not have the ".o" suffix.) The FLAG field of the master file must at least include the character device flag c. (You do not need the s flag for EISA device drivers because lboot can probe for EISA devices.)A more detailed description of the master file can be found in IDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," and in the master(1M) man page.The following example explores adding an ISA card device driver to the kernel. Assuming that the driver is called isacard.o, the following steps are necessary:Copy the driver object file isacard.o to /var/sysgen/boot.Create an isacard.sm system file in /var/sysgen/system.The file might contain the following lines:VECTOR: bustype=EISA module=isacard ctlr=0 adapter=0iospace=(EISAIO,0x300,48) probe_space=(wr,EISAIO,0x300,1, 0x11,0xff)
VECTOR: bustype=EISA module=isacard ctlr=1 adapter=0iospace=(EISAIO,0x330,48) probe_space=(wr,EISAIO,0x330,1, 
0x11,0xff)This would allow a kernel to support two of the same ISA cards located at different addresses. A one-byte test for card existence will be made at ISA I/O addresses 0x300 and 0x330. If either card returns the value written at one of those locations, the driver will be included in the kernel. Also a 48-byte ISA register address space will be allocated to the card without a memory address space being allocated in the example above.Create a master file for the driver in the /var/sysgen/master.d directory. Check /usr/include/sys/major.h for available major device numbers or lboot can assign one. See IDREF="89133" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 11, "Kernel-level Dynamically Loadable Modules (DLMs)," for more information on loadable drivers and master.d configuration:COLUMNS="5"LEFT="0" WIDTH="45"*FlagLEFT="50" WIDTH="54"PrefixLEFT="110" WIDTH="45"SoftLEFT="160" WIDTH="45"#DevLEFT="210" WIDTH="126"DependenciesLEFT="0" WIDTH="45"cLEFT="50" WIDTH="54"isaLEFT="110" WIDTH="45"60LEFT="160" WIDTH="45"≠LEFT="210" WIDTH="126"Note that even though the module name is referred to as isacard, the prefix for each of the driver routines can be independently declared, in this case as simply "isa."LBL="" HELPID=""System File ExampleTo add an EISA driver to the kernel, the system file might look like this:VECTOR: bustype=EISA module=eisacard ctlr=0 adapter=0        iospace=(EISAIO,0x1000,0x1000)        iospace2=(EISAMEM,0xC8000,0x10000)        exprobe_space=(r,EISAIO,0x1C80,4,         0x00008107, 0xffffffff)

In this example, the manufacturer ID is AZA with a product number and revision number of zero. In addition to specifying the I/O register space on a per-slot basis, the VECTOR: lines in the above example also reserve 0x10000 bytes of memory space for each card. Each card placed in the system will be uniquely identified to the system by its ctlr number, which also happens to correspond directly to the slot number (although this is not a requirement).LBL="" HELPID=""Writing edtinit()If you use the VECTOR: directive to configure a driver into the kernel, your driver can use a routine of the form drvedtinit(), where drv is the driver prefix. If your device driver object module includes a drvedtinit() routine, the system executes the drvedtinit() routine when the system boots. In general, you can use your drvedtinit() routine to perform any device driver initialization you want. Typically, the edtinit() routine is used to allocate and map in the resources that are needed for the driver to initialize the hardware and execute. The resources that might need to be initialized are: semaphores or other locks used by the driverI/O and memory spaceinterrupt (IRQ) inputsDMA channels.When the system calls your driver's edtinit() routine, it hands the routine a pointer to a structure of type edt.Synopsisvoid drvedtinit(struct edt *e)

For bus type EISA_ADAP, it points to NULL.e_initDevice initialization routine.e_spaceThis array of iospace_t declarations tells the driver which I/O and memory spaces the hardware is programmed to respond to.LBL="" HELPID=""I/O and Memory Space InitializationIn the example below, e_space array contains the iospace structures that are used to map in the card's address space. There are two steps in this process: allocating a PIO map and then mapping the requested bus space address into a kernel address.On the Indigo2 the mapping is a fixed mapping, which permanently maps the entire EISA I/O and memory address space into kernel space, but using the piomap() call will allow your driver to remain fully compatible with potential future hardware that uses programmable I/O space map registers like those used for VME on the CHALLENGE and Onyx architectures. (Simplifies porting of the driver to future hardware.)NoteThe device will only respond to the requested memory address range if it has been programmed through software (in the case of an EISA card) or jumpered on the card (in the case of an ISA card).Before actually beginning to program the card after mapping in the I/O space, it is wise to probe for the card's existence by writing and rereading a register located on the card. This allows the driver to recover if the device has been removed from the system since the kernel was built or if the kernel is copied to another system with a different hardware configuration.CautionThe probe during edtinit() has a bus error handler in place. After this, a bus error ordinarily causes an operating system panic.In the edtinit() for your driver, you must allocate the necessary mapping resources before you actually map the memory address. The mapping resource allocation and mapping calls apply across all of Silicon Graphics bus adapters (i.e., VME). Their structures are defined in <sys/pio.h.>. piomap_t *pio_mapalloc(uint_t bus, uint_t adap, iospace_t
                       iospace, int flag, char *name)This routine allocates a handle that specifies a mapping from kernel virtual space to I/O and memory address space. The returned piomap_t handle is used to provide the mapping to the address space through additional PIO access functions.Currently, the bus and adap arguments must be ADAP_EISA and 0 respectively, because there is only one EISA bus on Indigo2 platforms. The name argument is a string used to identify which device has a particular space mapped.The actual mapping is returned by:caddr_t pio_mapaddr(piomap_t *piomap, iopaddr_t io)This function returns the kernel virtual address that maps to the PIO-mapped I/O space address.Silicon Graphics also supports a set of routines that allow a driver to operate on an I/O address space that has an allocated piomap, but does not have a kernel virtual address mapped to the I/O space. For example:void pio_bcopyin(piomap_t *pmap, iopaddr_t io, caddr_t a,     int len)
void pio_bcopyout(piomap_t *pmap, iopaddr_t io, caddr_t a,     int len)For a complete specification of the piomap* functions, see <sys/pio.h>.NoteThere is not currently any advantage to using the routines listed above, although they may be useful on future Silicon Graphics platforms.LBL="" HELPID=""Dynamic Resource AllocationRather than bind the interrupt IRQ input and a specific channel for DMA to a specific VECTOR: entry at lboot time, the driver allocates these resources dynamically. In the case of interrupts, there are three parts to the process:A specific IRQ number is obtained from the system on a "first come first served" basis through a call to eisa_ivec_alloc(). The mask parameter passed in its 16-bit bitmap vector specifies which IRQ choices are acceptable for this device hardware. This is necessary because most EISA cards can only be programmed to respond to a limited number of IRQ possibilities. In the case of an ISA card, which is jumpered to only respond to a single IRQ input, the vector only has a single bit "on" to specify this particular setting. Multiple cards can be assigned the same IRQ, although, by default, the allocation routine tries to assign an unused interrupt input. The allocation routine only returns failure if the driver requests a vector for a mask, and all mask choices are already programmed to respond to an incompatible choice for edge- or level-sensitive interrupts. Each IRQ can respond to either edge- or level-sensitive interrupts, but not to both.The EISA interrupt priority level is used to specify the interrupt IRQ number for the device. Its range is IRQ0-IRQ15, excluding IRQ2, which is used to cascade the interrupt controllers. EISA directly associates the interrupt priority to the IRQ input line. See the Intel 82357 Specification or the EISATechnical Reference Guide for a description of the priority ordering scheme.There are two system resources that need to be reserved by some EISA/ISA drivers: interrupt request inputs (IRQ's) and DMA channels. Instead of pre-allocating these in the system file, a dynamic allocation scheme hands them out to the driver at initialization time. The driver is responsible for specifying which choices for IRQs and DMA channels are acceptable for the particular hardware. The operating system uses the appropriate allocation routine to assign them to the driver, which then uses the returned value to configure the hardware to respond appropriately.The card is programmed to generate its interrupt on the assigned IRQ. This is a device-specific procedure. ISA cards typically cannot change their IRQ through software; they usually have to be jumpered.The value must be selected from IRQ 3-7, 9-12, 14, and 15. All EISA interrupts are channeled into one CPU interrupt level. The priority of this CPU interrupt is below that of the clock and at the same level as on-board devices. Although the EISA interrupt is generated at the same level, it is serviced when the CPU services EISA interrupts. It services the EISA-bus interrupts in order of their EISA-bus priority, at least in that order when multiple devices interrupt at the same time.A specific routine and argument input is associated with the assigned IRQ. This is done through the call to eisa_ivec_set().Once eisa_ivec_set() has been used to bind the selected IRQ to an interrupt handling routine, all interrupts generated to that IRQ cause the related handling routine to be called. Since multiple cards may be responsible for the interrupt, the driver is required to check its own hardware registers to test for the cause of the pending interrupt. The call is specified as:eisa_ivec_set (vint_t adapter, int irq, void (func*)(),      int arg);func passes arg as an argument when called. Typically, arg corresponds to the ctlr number of the device.The process for allocating a DMA channel is similar to that for obtaining an interrupt number. The call to the eisa_dmachan_alloc() routine uses an 8-bit mask to represent DMA channels zero through seven. Note that bit four must always be masked because that channel is unavailable for a card's case. The value returned by the channel allocation routine is then saved to program the device to transfer data on that particular channel, as specified in the section describing the EISA DMA utility functions.The following example is a possible outline initialization routine for the EISA device module declared in the previous section about the system files:#include <sys/types.h>

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="77936"EISA Locked CyclesThe EISA specification provides that you can lock the bus and hold it for exclusive access if you assert LOCK*. This allows atomic operations such as a test-and-set, and thus sets the basis for implementing semaphores between the CPU and bus masters. Because the actual system bus (a GIO bus) does not support a LOCK* operation, Silicon Graphics provides an interface that the CPU can use for read-modify-write style instructions.On Silicon Graphics systems that support EISA, if a bus master asserts LOCK*, some additional constraints apply to how long the bus master can hold the lock. Your locks should work correctly as long as your usage conforms to the read-modify-write paradigm used by the CPU programmatic interface. The following routines, which are also supported for VME device drivers, provide atomic and/or operations: they find the appropriate-sized mask by reading the PIO address, then they rewrite, modified by the mask value m.void pio_orb_rmw(piomap_t* pio, iopaddr_t io, uchar m)

If your driver passes addresses to bus masters, it must use a special set of DMA mapping routines to map the DMA target into physical addresses. The system uses these special mapping routines to support physical address spaces larger than 32 bits. On Silicon Graphics systems that support EISA, the physical address is used.

All Silicon Graphics systems provide an interface to at least a single SCSI bus for peripherals that support the SCSI standard. Your device driver can place commands on the bus by using the SCSI host adapter driver. Systems with POWERchannel I/O processor boards support two SCSI interfaces per POWERchannel board; those with POWERchannel-2 boards support two native SCSI interfaces plus as many as six additional SCSI interfaces, if mezzanine boards are used, for a maximum of eight SCSI interfaces per POWERchannel-2 board. Systems equipped with VME-SCSI (Jaguar) boards provide two buses per board.ID="chap52"The drivers support all three SCSI standards, SCSI-1, CCS The Common Command Set (CCS) standard is superseded by SCSI-2.
, and SCSI-2. Not all optional features are supported, and different systems support different features (such as synchronous, fast, and wide). In addition, DMA address mapping registers allow noncontiguous physical memory to appear contiguous to the SCSI host adapter. This allows your driver to handle I/O across noncontiguous pages in a single transfer (scatter-gather). The IRIX operating system provides an interface that hides much of the complexity of the SCSI bus management.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="59933"Choosing a Driver ModelChoosing between a user-level and a kernel-level device driver model usually depends on the method used to transfer data to and from the device.ID="chap53"NoteSilicon Graphics has a generic SCSI device driver to support its SCSI hardware. This driver has entry points that enable programs to control devices unknown to the generic Silicon Graphics SCSI device driver. In other words, there are hooks to extend the SGI SCSI device driver to manage customer SCSI devices. In the strictest sense, this is not a device driver but an extension to a device driver.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="18160"User-level SCSI-bus Device DriverIf you must write a driver for a device that conforms to the SCSI standard, you can often use the ID="chap54"/dev/scsi/sc* special files and the dslib library of routines and macros to write a user-level program that sends SCSI commands to a device on the SCSI bus.ID="chap55"Although this dslib interface to the SCSI device differs from the IRIX standard device interface and requires that you be familiar with the SCSI protocol, you can typically write this sort of user-level SCSI device driver in a fraction of the time that it takes to write a kernel-level SCSI device driver. As a result, even if your ultimate goal is to write a kernel-level driver for a device, you can write a user-level device driver to test the device and familiarize yourself with its features.However, there are some limits. For example, quasi-SCSI devices that do not strictly adhere to SCSI standards for reporting errors can cause problems. In earlier IRIX releases, the user-level driver did not support SCSI commands of an unusual length (commands not of grp0, grp1, or grp2 length). IRIX 4.0 and later supports commands of 6-12 bytes, regardless of group. Finally, the dslib routines and macros may be somewhat less efficient (in terms of throughput) than a kernel-level SCSI driver. This lower efficiency may not be a problem when dealing with devices such as scanners and printers. DMA is used for all I/O, just as with kernel SCSI drivers.IRIX uses the devscsi driver for CDROM ISO-9660 filesystems as well as for HFS (AppleÆ MacintoshÆ) and DOS‘ floppy filesystems.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="11431"Kernel-level SCSI Device DriverYou may have to write a kernel-level SCSI driver for a SCSI device when you need the best throughput possible or when you must control an unusual SCSI device. See ID="chap56"ID="chap57"IDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," for a general description of the IRIX device driver interface.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="37474"User-level SCSI Device DriversThis section explains how to write a user-level driver for a SCSI device. It describes the SCSI interface routines for the integral SCSI controller and gives a short example.In IRIX 5.0 and later releases, a SCSI target may, in most cases, be used by more than one driver at a time unless it is opened in exclusive mode (currently, only the tpsc tape driver uses exclusive mode). See IDREF="90071" TYPE="TITLE""Kernel-level SCSI Device Drivers" for more information.NoteThere have been extensive changes in the kernel SCSI driver interface in the IRIX 5.x releases. In IRIX 5.x, the devscsi interface is available on the wd93, wd95, and VMESCSI (Jaguar) drivers. In prior releases, it was available only on the wd93. IRIX 5.2 and 5.3 remain source compatible, however.To control a SCSI device from a user-level program, you need the routines of the dslibID="chap58" library and a device-special file created for the device. The system comes with device-special files for SCSI adapters in the directory /dev/scsi. These files can be especially useful because they insulate the device driver writer from changes in operating system releases, and they remain valid across all Silicon Graphics platforms, independent of the low-level SCSI driver. Their limitation is that they are created for logical unit 0 only. (If the logical unit number for your device is not zero, you need to create a device-special file for the device. See IDREF="24560" TYPE="TITLE""Creating Device-special Files for User-level SCSI Drivers.")Which special files you use depends on the SCSI ID for the device, a number from 1-7 (wide SCSI is 1-15). The SCSI ID for a device is usually controlled by switch settings or jumpers. (See the device technical specification for details.) For a SCSI device with a SCSI ID of 3 on controller 0, use /dev/scsi/sc0d3l0; use /dev/scsi/sc0d7l0 for a SCSI device with a SCSI ID of 7, and so on. See the man page for the ds(7M) command for more details on device naming.The remainder of this chapter assumes that you are familiar with the SCSI interface.

Understanding this structure is essential to writing a user-level SCSI driver. Your driver can access these fields directly; however, for many common tasks that involve controlling a SCSI device, dslib has simple routines or macros that can access these values for you. The advantage of using these macros and routines is that, if the structure should change in a future release, you can accommodate the change by changing the internals of the macros or simply recompiling with new macro defs in dsreq.h.

To open and close the device, your program must use the dslib routines ID="chap5176"dsopen() and ID="chap5177"dsclose(), rather than the ID="chap5178"open() and ID="chap5179"close() system calls. These routines set up data structures for the other library routines.NoteThis means that only specially compiled programs can use these devices; most standard programs will not be able to use them.The reason for this departure from IRIX is that dslib is actually a library of routines and macros that provide an interface to the device driver for the SCSI bus. By controlling the SCSI bus, you can control any device on that bus, providing the SCSI-bus device driver contains support for it. Such a SCSI-bus device driver is available on Silicon Graphics systems. However, using the ioctl() of the SCSI bus device driver directly can be complex. The routines of dslib provide access to ioctl() for the SCSI bus in a safe and relatively straightforward way.For more on the dslib routines, see the online man pages dslib(3X) and ds(7M). The source for dslib is included in 4Dgifts.sw.giftsfull in 5.0 in the directory /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/devices/devscsi.LBL="" HELPID=""Opening a SCSI DeviceTo open a device on the SCSI bus, a user-level program calls dsopenID="chap5180"(), which calls the open() of the device driver for the SCSI bus and allocates data structures. If the open succeeds, the kernel allocates a SCSI subchannel for the device on the bus that you want to control. If this succeeds, a dsreqID="chap5181" type structure is allocated, which in turn sets the values of some of its members and returns a pointer to this structure as its function value. This allocated and primed dsreq type structure is the medium of communication between your user program and the SCSI device.LBL="" HELPID=""Sending Commands to a SCSI DeviceTo send commands to the device on the SCSI bus, your program can modify the members of the dsreq type structure and call the dslib routine doscsireqID="chap5182"(). This command uses an ioctl() call to the SCSI bus interface driver to set the members of the scsisubchanID="chap5183" type structure for the device according to the information in the dsreq structure.To simplify sending commands to a SCSI device, dslib provides routines and macros that set members of the dsreq type structure and call doscsireq(). For example, dslib provides the routine write0aID="chap5184"() to give you an easy way to issue a simple group 0 "write" command. However, since few truly general SCSI commands exist, the dslib provides functions such as ID="chap5185"fillg0cmd() to give you a relatively painless way to send vendor-specific commands to a device on the SCSI bus. You can (and are expected) to extend these as needed, since the library source is included in the 4Dgifts subsystem.LBL="" HELPID=""Closing a SCSI DeviceWhen your user-level program is done with the SCSI device, it must call dsclose() to close the device. This involves freeing the dsreq type structure and kernel data structures, among other things.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="90071"Kernel-level SCSI Device DriversThis section shows how to write a kernel-level driver for a SCSI device. Starting with IRIX 5.x, all supported SCSI controllers use the same interface.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="36812"Configuring a Kernel-level SCSI DriverIDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," gives a detailed description of how to configure a kernel to include a new driver. This section presents only the material that is unique to SCSI drivers. Recall that you must:Create the object code for the driver you want to include in the kernel.Move that object code to the directory /usr/sysgen/boot.Edit the system file. Use a directive telling lboot, the configuration utility, how to include your driver and specify which memory space your device will allocate. Install it in the /var/sysgen/system directory using the driver name appended by .sm.Create a master file in the directory /usr/sysgen/master.d.Create a new kernel. (To create a debuggable kernel, see IDREF="32442" TYPE="TITLE""Making a Debuggable Kernel" in IDREF="57559" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 10, "Driver Installation and Testing.")To edit the system file (/usr/sysgen/system) to include a SCSI driver, use the INCLUDE directive to tell ID="chap5186"ID="chap5187"lboot to unconditionally add the named SCSI module into the new kernel.To create a ID="chap5188"master file, create an ASCII file, enter the appropriate information (described below), and move the file to the /usr/sysgen/master.d directory. The name of the master file must correspond to the name of the file containing the object code for the driver.Ensure that the FLAG field of the master file includes at least the character device flag c and the software driver flag s. You must flag all SCSI device drivers as software drivers (drivers that do not control actual hardware) because lboot cannot probe for SCSI devices. Although lboot does probe for the SCSI controller, the target devices that the SCSI controller manages cannot be probed by a memory reference/access.
 If lboot tries to probe for a SCSI device, it fails, then assumes that the device is not present, and does not include your SCSI device driver in the kernel.For example, assume that you want your kernel to include a device driver for a SCSI device that you call sdkID="chap5189". Create the object code for the device driver, and move the sdk.o object file to the directory /usr/sysgen/boot. After examining /usr/include/sys/major.h, you determine that major device number 61 is available and can be used for the device, sdk. Create a file sdk.sm with the following line, and also add it to the system file:INCLUDE: sdk
ID="chap5190"You then create a master ASCII file called /usr/sysgen/master.d/sdk and enter:*
* sdk
*
*FLAG   PREFIX   SOFT   #DEV   DEPENDENCIES

The SCSI interface is described later in this chapter.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="17539"Writing a SCSI init()ID="chap5191"Because you use the INCLUDE directive to include a module into the kernel, your driver object module must contain a routine of the form ID="chap5192"drvinit(), where drvID="chap5193" is the prefix for the device that you specified in the master file.

};LBL="" HELPID=""ID="13658"SCSI Device Interface OverviewThe SCSI host adapter communicates with devices, known as ID="chap5199"targets, on the SCSI bus. Each SCSI target can control a number of actual devices, known as ID="chap5200"logical units. Most SCSI targets, however, control a single device.There are two types of SCSI drivers: device level drivers and host adapter drivers. The host adapter drivers handle the low-level communication over the SCSI interface, such as programming the SCSI interface chip or board, negotiating synchronous or wide mode, and handling disconnect/reconnect. The device drivers handle high-level communication, primarily by issuing SCSI commands and interpreting sense data.Some examples of host adapter drivers are wd93, wd95, and jag. Examples of device level drivers are dksc, tpsc, and smfd.There are four basic interfaces used to communicate to a host adapter driver: scsi_info, scsi_alloc, scsi_free, and scsi_command(). Each of these interfaces is implemented as an array of pointers to functions, indexed by a host adapter driver number. The host adapter driver number is determined from the adapter number. The adapter number ranges are defined in sys/scsi.h, and are different on different architectures. In general, Integral SCSI controllers start at adapter 0, and Interphase VME-SCSI (Jaguar) controllers start after the last Integral adapter. Each SCSI bus is considered to be one adapter. On a POWER Series or Crimson system, for example, Interphase VME-SCSI controller 3, bus 0, would be adapter number 10. On a CHALLENGE/Onyx system, VME-SCSI controller 3, bus 0, would be adapter number 134. See the definitions of SCSI_SGISTART, SCSI_SGICOUNT, SCSI_JAGSTART, and SCSI_JAGCOUNT in sys/scsi.h.LBL="" HELPID=""Determining Driver NumberTo determine the correct number for your driver, see ID="chap5201"scsi_driver_table in sys/scsi.h. scsi_driver_table is an array, indexed by adapter number, that returns the adapter type, which is a constant defined by the SCSIDRIVER_XXX definitions. scsi_driver_table may be sparsely populated to accommodate possible options. This avoids the reassignment of major and minor device numbers in cases where hardware is added at a later time.SCSI_XXXSTART definitions define the starting adapter number for the various adapter types. SCSI_XXXCOUNT is the number of possible adapters for a given controller type. Both SCSIDRIVER_WD93 and SCSIDRIVER_WD95 are part of Silicon Graphics-built SCSI controllers, and so use the SCSI_SGISTART and SCSI_SGICOUNT#define's. For example, on a CHALLENGE system, the second bus on Interphase VME-SCSI controller 4 would be considered adapter number 137. Counting SCSI_JAGSTART as 128, (controller 4 * 2 adapters per controller) + bus 1 (the second bus on the controller) gives 9 to be added to the value of SCSI_JAGSTART to give adapter (or bus) number 137 from the point of view of a SCSI device driver.Typically, the major and minor numbers of a device are used to determine the adapter number, which can then be used to index into scsi_driver_table.adap = sdk_adap_num(device);
driver_num = scsi_driver_table[adap];LBL="" HELPID=""scsi_info ≠ Getting Information About a DeviceBefore your driver tries to access a device, it must call the host adapter scsi_info function. The host adapter driver then issues an Inquiry command to the given device and returns a pointer to a struct scsi_target_info. If the Inquiry is not successful name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' or if the adapter, target, or lun is invalid name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' the return value is NULL. The SCSI device driver must examine the inquiry data to determine whether it is the appropriate driver for the device.Synopsisstruct scsi_target_info * (*scsi_info[])                         (u_char adapter, u_char target, u_char lun);ArgumentsadapterThe adapter number.targetThe target number.lunThe logical unit number.ExampleThe following would be the way to use scsi_info to get information about target 5, LUN 0 on Interphase controller 4, bus 1 (the second bus):info = (*scsi_info[SCSIDRIVER_JAG])(9, 5, 0);LBL="" HELPID=""scsi_alloc ≠ Initializing a ConnectionBefore your driver can issue a command to a SCSI device through scsi_command, it must have the low-level driver initialize the connection. The interface to this low-level driver is through the scsi_alloc(), typically in the drvopen() routine.Synopsisint (*scsi_alloc[driver_num])    (unsigned char adap, unsigned char target,      unsigned char lun, int option, void (*callback)());Argumentsadap The number of the SCSI adapter for the device you want to control. All IRIX systems support at least one adapter (0). Systems with POWERchannel have two or four built-in adapters and up to 16 VME-SCSI adapters (two per controller). CHALLENGE/Onyx systems can have up to 120 different built-in SCSI adapters (although one system can have only a fraction of those installed at one time) and 16 VME-SCSI adapters; Indigo2 systems have two adapters.targetThe target ID of the SCSI controller for the device your driver wants to control. This must be a value from 0 to 15, but cannot be the ID of the controller itself (typically 0 for built-in and 7 for the Jaguar). Not all host adapter implementations support SCSI device numbers 8 through 15. (Note that for this purpose, the Jaguar VME_SCSI controller has two SCSI host adapters, so only devices 0-7 are valid. Choose the bus number with adap.) Usually, the device is configured to a fixed ID by switch settings or jumpers. Refer to the device technical specification for details. If the system contains more than one of a particular device, the device driver normally uses the minor device number to distinguish between devices.lunThe logical unit number for the device your driver wants to control. This is often 0 because most SCSI targets support only a single logical unit.optionTwo options are available to scsi_alloc:SCSIALLOC_EXCLUSIVE specifies that the device driver wants to have exclusive access to the target in question. If any other device has allocated a connection, the scsi_alloc call fails.SCSIALLOC_QDEPTH, the queue depth that your driver requests, is the bottom eight bits of option. It is considered advice only, and may or may not be followed.callbackGets a pointer to a function that the host adapter driver calls every time it has sense data. Only one driver at a time may have a callback allocated, so, in this respect, it functions like SCSIALLOC_EXCLUSIVE in the option argument above. If the callback argument is not NULL, the host adapter driver calls it with a pointer to the sense data (an array of char) every time there is any. This allows multiple drivers to access a device while still allowing one of them to keep apprised of all sense data.ReturnsIf the call to scsi_alloc is successful, the type of SCSI adapter being used (SCSIDRIVER_WD93, SCSIDRIVER_WD95, or SCSIDRIVER_JAG) is returned. Otherwise, this routine returns 0, which indicates that no connection could be established between the host adapter driver and your driver, probably because the arguments were included for the adapter.LBL="" HELPID=""scsi_command ≠ Executing a SCSI CommandOnce your driver has established a connection to a host adapter driver with a successful call to ID="chap5202"scsi_alloc[](), your driver can send SCSI commands to the device. To send SCSI commands to a device, fill out a scsi_request structure and then call scsi_command[](), passing it the address of this structure. The system uses this structure to report back on the status of the SCSI command.Not all scsi_request type structure members are of interest to your device driver (some members are of interest only to the SCSI host adapter driver and may change across releases of the operating system). Following is the definition of the structure scsi_request:struct scsi_request

typedef struct scsi_request      scsi_request_t;Before calling scsi_command[](), your driver must fill in the values indicated above. Some are optional.sr_ctlrNumber of the adapter where the command will be transferred.sr_targetID of the target where the command will be transferred.sr_lunNumber of the logical unit where the command will be transferred.sr_tagType of queue tag to use (see SCSI-2 specification). Not all tag types are supported by all drivers.sr_commandGive this member a pointer to the SCSI command descriptor block that you want to send to the device.sr_cmdlenThe length (in bytes) of the command to which the sr_command member points. You can use three symbolic constants for this member (the constants are defined in sys/scsi.h), but other values are permitted for vendor unique commands, too:SC_CLASS0_SZ is a command size of 6 bytes.SC_CLASS1_SZ is a command size of 10 bytes.SC_CLASS2_SZ is a command size of 12 bytes.sr_flagsThis member must set zero or more options as specified below:SRF_DIR_IN name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' Data associated with the command will be written into memory.SRF_FLUSHname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' A cache operation is required on the data.SRF_MAPname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' The sr_buffer address needs to be mapped -- it is a kernel virtual address.SRF_MAPBPname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'sr_bp has a pointer to a structbuf that is not mapped (BP_ISMAPPED returns false).SRF_AEN_ACKname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' This request acknowledges an error in a previous request. Once a scsi_request is returned with an error, all further requests are returned with SC_ATTN, without being acted upon, until SRF_AEN_ACK is set.SRF_NEG_ASYNCname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' This request attempts to negotiate async xfer mode on this command (if currently using sync xfers).SRF_NEG_SYNCname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' This request attempts to negotiate sync xfer mode on this command if currently asynchronous. It may be ignored by some adapter drivers, either always or if the driver has previously failed to negotiate sync xfer mode with this target. This overrides the SCSIALLOC_NOSYNC flag to scsi_alloc (if it has been specified).sr_timeoutThe maximum amount of time, in Hz, that a command can take.sr_bufferA pointer to the start of the data associated with a command. If there is no data (as with a test_unit_ready for instance), sr_buffer must be NULL.sr_buflenThe maximum amount of data that can be transferred. This is not necessarily the amount that will be transferred, but is an upper limit.sr_senseA pointer to a buffer where request sense data can be copied in case a command gets a check condition status.sr_senselenThe amount of space reserved for request sense data.sr_notifyA pointer to a notification routine. The notification routine gets called when a command is complete or gets an error. This value must be set (NULL is not a valid value).sr_bpThis field must point to the struct buf corresponding that generated the scsi_request if the SRF_MAPBP flag is set in sr_flags. If the SRF_MAPBP flag is not set, then sr_bp is not used by the host adapter driver.sr_devThis field is never used by a host adapter driver and is reserved for the use of your device driver.After control returns from the host adapter driver to your driver, your driver must check the following members of the scsi_request type structure. These members are:sr_statusThis member reports the overall status of the SCSI command (this is the host adapter driver status; SCSI bus status is in sr_scsi_status). sr_status can report one of these values:SC_GOODID="chap5203"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates no error. The bus successfully processed the SCSI command; however, the command itself may still have failed (see sr_scsi_status).SC_TIMEOUTID="chap5204"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates selection timeout. The device did not respond to selection within 250 milliseconds.SC_HARDERRID="chap5205"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates hardware or SCSI device error, usually a SCSI bus reset, possibly caused by a bad phase or time-out on some other device.SC_PARITYID="chap5206"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates an unrecoverable parity error on the SCSI bus.SC_MEMERRID="chap5207"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates an unrecoverable parity or ECC error from host memory.SC_CMDTIMEID="chap5208"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates the command did not complete before the time-out specified in s_timeoutval elapsed.SC_ALIGNID="chap5209"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates the buffer address did not meet the alignment requirements of the system. Most Silicon Graphics systems require starting buffer addresses to be on a four-byte boundary.SC_ATTNID="chap5210"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates the scsi_request() has been aborted by a SCSI bus reset, the device, or the driver, due to an error in another request.SC_REQUESTID="chap5211"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates the request is not a valid request. This can be because no scsi_alloc has been done successfully or because the scsi_request() has conflicting or illegal values, such as sr_notify being set to NULL.sr_scsi_statusThe SCSI status byte sent by the target. sr_scsi_status can report any one of these values: The values of sr_sci_status correspond to those described in the SCSI specification:ST_GOODID="chap5212"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates the target has successfully completed the SCSI command. On this value, sr_sensegotten must be checked to see if a check condition occurred on the command.ST_CHECKID="chap5213"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates that the request sense command generated by the host adapter driver in response to a check condition also got a check condition. This is a special case. If a device reports a "check condition" status, the host adapter driver automatically issues a requestsense command and reports the status of that command in this byte. If sr_sense is set and sr_senselen is > 0, sr_sensegotten is set to the number of bytes of sense data received, or to -1 if an error occurs during the request sense command.ST_COND_METID="chap5214"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates search condition satisfied.ST_BUSYID="chap5215"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates the target is busy. Normally, the driver should delay, then reissue the command.ST_INT_GOODID="chap5216"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates this status is reported for every command in a series of linked commands. Although they are not supported, these linked commands may sometimes work.ST_RES_CONFID="chap5217"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' indicates an attempt to access a logical unit or an extent within a logical unit that reserves that type of access to another SCSI device.This byte corresponds to the SCSI command status byte as documented in the SCSI specifications.sr_sensegottenThe number of bytes of sense data gotten as a result of a request sense command issued in response to a check condition status from this command, if any, or -1 if a check condition occurs, but the request sense command fails.sr_residThe difference between sr_buflen and the number of bytes actually transferred.LBL="" HELPID=""scsi_free ≠ Freeing the ConnectionID="chap5218"When your driver is done with a SCSI device, it must call through the array scsi_free to indicate to the host adapter driver that your driver no longer needs to use the device. Typically, you do this in your drvclose() routine.Synopsisint (*scsi_free[driver_num])    (unsigned char adap, unsigned char target,      unsigned char lun, void (*callback)());The arguments to scsi_free are similar to those to scsi_alloc except that no option argument is used.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="42451"Using the SCSI Access RoutinesIDREF="13658" TYPE="TITLE""SCSI Device Interface Overview" describes the four routines that make up the device driver interface to host adapter SCSI-bus drivers. This section describes how you can use these routines in your driver.Your drvopen() routine should first use ID="chap5219"scsi_info to determine whether a device is present on the SCSI bus and to examine the inquiry information to see what type of device it is. Remember, SCSI target 3 may be a disk on one system but a tape drive on another. So be sure to check the inquiry information to determine whether your driver is appropriate to the device in question.After your driver has determined that it is appropriate to talk to a device, it must then use ID="chap5220"scsi_alloc to initialize a connection between your device driver and the host adapter driver.Your driver can free the connection by using scsi_free. Remember that if your driver uses the exclusive option, no other SCSI device driver can communicate with a target until your driver calls scsi_free. Similarly, if your driver uses a sense callback, no other driver can use a sense callback until your driver calls scsi_free, although other drivers that do not need a sense callback may still communicate with the target.Because the IRIX SCSI interface transfers data using direct memory access (DMA) only, your driver must use the kernel routine physio() and a drvstrategy() routine for SCSI I/O to transfer data to pages that a user process is using. Internally generated requests that transfer data into kernel memory (either statically allocated at compile time in the driver or allocated through ID="chap5221"kmem_alloc() or similar functions) do not need to use ID="chap5222"physio(). However, in this case your driver must do its own cache flushing.When filling out a scsi_request structure in preparation for a call to scsi_command, be sure to fill out the sr_ctlr, sr_target, sr_lun, and sr_tag fields with appropriate values. The sr_command field must point to an array of characters filled out with the SCSI command byte values, and sr_cmdlen must be the length of the command. sr_flags is used to specify the direction of data transfer, if any, whether cache flushes need to be done, and what kind of mapping needs to be done. If the data transfer involves direct mapped K0SEG or K1SEG memory, then no mapping need be specified, although the host adapter may still perform some mapping. The flags must also acknowledge an error by setting the SRF_AEN_ACK bit on the next command or the command will fail immediately.sr_timeout must be the command timeout in clock ticks (defined by Hz), typically 1/100 of a second. Check the header file and include the file that defines Hz. Do not hard-code the value of Hz into a driver.sr_buffer must be a pointer to the start of the buffer to be transferred to, unless there is no data transfer or the SRF_MAPBP flag in sr_flags is set, in which case sr_buffer can be NULL. sr_buflen must be an amount equal to the maximum amount of data to be transferred in the command.If your driver wants to examine sense data from a request sense caused by a check condition that occurs as a result of the command you issued, it can set the sr_sense field to point to such a buffer, with sr_senselen set to the size of the buffer. The sr_notify must point to your driver "interrupt" routine. This is not a real interrupt routinename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'it is called indirectly as a result of an interrupt from the interrupt handlername='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'so it can have any name you desire. This routine is called when the host adapter driver has completed processing your command.If the SRF_MAPBP flag is set, sr_bp must point to the buf structure that generated the SCSI request. Sometimes your driver strategy function will get a buf that is not mapped into kernel virtual memory. In this case, BP_ISMAPPED(bp), where bp is a pointer to the buf, will return false. If SRF_MAPBP is not used, sr_bp is free to be used by your driver for other purposes. sr_dev is always a spare field usable by your driver, often for linking lists of active or queued requests or to keep special information.After your notify function is called, your driver must check the sr_status, sr_scsi_status, and sr_sensegotten fields to see whether there were any errors. See /usr/include/sys/scsi.h for additional information on return values for the sr_status field. The sr_scsi_status field corresponds to the SCSI status byte that a target sends at the end of every command. However, if a target sends a check condition (status 2), a request sense is issued instead; otherwise sr_scsi_status is 0. sr_sensegotten is nonzero: -1 if there is an error getting sense data or the amount of sense data actually received. Otherwise, sr_resid will be the difference between sr_buflen and the amount of data actually transferred.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="31646"SCSI Device Driver ExampleThe following example shows how a driver can communicate with a direct access SCSI device, such as a disk. Note the use of scsi_info[]() to determine that the device is actually present and of the appropriate type.This driver is simplified and does not do as much error checking as a real driver would do. Also, this example uses a global SCSI request structure that does not work in real drivers, since multiple reads or writes would overwrite a command in progress.#include "sys/param.h"

It describes the system configuration for GIO device drivers and introduces several GIO-specific functions you must include in your device driver. There are several models for performing DMA operations. Which model you choose for your device driver depends on the capability of the device, which may either require a software implementation or have hardware support for scatter/gather. Memory-mapped, user-level drivers for GIO devices are not supported; all GIO drivers must be kernel-level drivers.This chapter contains the following sections:IDREF="95208" TYPE="TITLE""GIO-bus Architecture"IDREF="36604" TYPE="TITLE""Determining GIO Device Addresses"IDREF="40037" TYPE="TITLE""Including GIO Device Drivers in the Kernel"IDREF="22713" TYPE="TITLE""Writing edtinit()"IDREF="52744" TYPE="TITLE""GIO-specific Functions"IDREF="14468" TYPE="TITLE""GIO Interrupt Handler"IDREF="21375" TYPE="TITLE""Programmed I/O (PIO)"IDREF="10599" TYPE="TITLE""DMA Operations"IDREF="34402" TYPE="TITLE""Memory Parity Workarounds"IDREF="29011" TYPE="TITLE""GIO Devices with Hardware-supported Scatter/Gather Capability"IDREF="18725" TYPE="TITLE""DMA on GIO Devices Without Scatter/Gather Capability"IDREF="58731" TYPE="TITLE""Device Driver Example"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="95208"GIO-bus ArchitectureThe GIO bus is a family of synchronous, multiplexed address-data buses for connecting high-speed devices to main memory and CPU for entry-level Silicon Graphics systems. The GIO bus has three varieties: GIO32, GIO32-bis, and GIO64.The members of the GIO-bus family are all similar; however, the GIO32 and GIO64 are not compatible. A GIO32 device does not work in a GIO64 slot, but a GIO32-bis device does fit in either a GIO32 or GIO32-bis option slot. It is possible to design a board that functions in systems with either a GIO32 or GIO32-bis bus.The form factor and bus protocol depend on the specific platform in which the device is installed. GIO32 and GIO32-bis devices can be either single or double-wide (that is, taking one or both board slots), while GIO64 boards are the size of an EISA board. Slots in Indigo2 systems can accept either an EISA board or a GIO64 board. These two types of boards share common board dimensions but have different connectors for attaching to their respective buses.The GIO Bus Specification contains more detailed information about the various types of GIO buses, from both an electrical and a mechanical point of view.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="36604"Determining GIO Device AddressesEach GIO device has a range of GIO-bus addresses to which it responds. These addresses correspond to device registers or on-board memory, depending on the GIO device.ID="chap61" Unlike VME, where the class of device determines the address range, each GIO device responds to the same address range.
 GIO-bus addresses cannot be mapped into user address space. GIO devices can be classified as 32-bit or 64-bit. The address range for GIO-bus devices is determined by the slot number of the device. The hardware must be designed to determine which slot the device is in and make the appropriate adjustments to respond to that slot's address range.ID="chap62"Indigo, Indigo2, and Indy systems all have two slots available for GIO devices. However, the address spaces for Indigo2 are slightly different than for Indigo and Indy.For Indigo and Indy, the two slots are known as exp0 and exp1. The Indigo2's slots are known as gfx, exp0, and exp1.The gfx slot is normally used for the graphics card, but it can be used as a regular GIO card slot if the graphics can be moved up into the exp0 slot. This slot's address space is also available on Challenge M (Indigo2 with no graphics) systems.IDREF="59181" TYPE="TABLE"Table 6-1 shows the slot names and addresses available on the Indigo, Indigo2, and Indy platforms.

Interrupts 0 and 2 are used by the graphics system and may not be used by GIO-bus devices.Since one interrupt serves multiple GIO devices, the interrupt routine in each driver must be able to deal with the various interrupt situations:The interrupt is for the board.The interrupt is for some other GIO device.There is no interrupt pending.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="40037"Including GIO Device Drivers in the KernelIDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," provides general information on adding a driver to the kernel. This section describes specifics concerning GIO drivers. To add a new kernel-level GIO device driver, you must:Create a system fileCreate a master fileCreate the boot fileFor GIO drivers, use the INCLUDE directive, which unconditionally adds the module to the kernel. Because lboot can probe for GIO devices, lboot can conditionally include a GIO device driver into the kernel.NoteBecause IRIX kernels cannot, as a rule, be preempted, any driver that sits in a loop waiting for some condition to be satisfied may tie a processor up for as long as it wants. Real-time processes, such as audio, are very sensitive to such delays.ID="chap63"LBL="" HELPID=""Creating a System FileThis file resides in the /var/sysgen/system directory and contains the instructions that lboot uses to add the software module to the kernel. This normally consists of the VECTOR directive; in fact, the ID="chap64"system file may consist of one or more VECTOR directives. The filename must end in .sm for lboot to recognize and include the software module. Typically, the filename is the software module's name with the .sm suffix, as in gbd.sm.If the current system contains the GIO device, lboot includes the driver; otherwise, it saves memory by leaving it out. Use the VECTOR directive to include a GIO device conditionally. In addition to the module name, the VECTORID="chap65" directive requires that you fill out these fields:vectorThe interrupt vector value, as described previously. The interrupt vector for GIO devices is set using the setgiovectorID="chap66"() function (see IDREF="86230" TYPE="TITLE""setgiovector"). Therefore, the vector in the VECTOR statement must always be 0x0 for GIO devices.unitThe device number that differentiates between more than one device of the same type. This value is related to VME-style devices. For GIO devices, this value can be anything, but for consistency, make it 0.baseThe device address(es) on the GIO bus, determined by the slot in which the board is installed. This is a K1 address (see the ID="chap67"IDREF="kvtophys(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="kvtophys(D3X)"kvtophys(D3X)
 man page).base2, base3Additional addresses passed to driver edtinit() routine through the edt structure. These are K1 addresses (see the IDREF="kvtophys(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="kvtophys(D3X)"kvtophys(D3X)
 man page).exprobe   The address read when lboot determines the existence of the device. This address is often the same as the base address. If you do not specify a probe address, the module is automatically included in the kernel. For GIO bus devices, the exprobe() call is used in place of the probe call. The fields used for this call are:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"operationLEFT="80" WIDTH="189"read (r) or write (w)LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"addressLEFT="80" WIDTH="189"address to probeLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"# of bytes LEFT="80" WIDTH="189"number of bytes to read or writeLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"valueLEFT="80" WIDTH="189"expected response value (the GIO ID

It contains the information that lboot uses to create the device switch table as well as indicating dependencies with other kernel modules. The name of the master file must be the same as the software module. This file also contains the prefix used in building the driver entry points. The FLAG field of the master file must include at least the character device flag c. LBL="" HELPID=""Creating a Boot FileThe boot file must reside in the /var/sysgen/boot directory. This file is the successfully compiled driver object file. The name of the boot file must end with the suffix ".o". The ".a" suffix is used for archived files.LBL="" HELPID=""The GBD ExampleFor example, to add a mythical GIO device driver to the kernel of an R4000 Indigo (IP20), you must copy the driver object file gbd.o to /usr/sysgen/boot, create a master file (as shown below), and create a system file with the following VECTOR directive:VECTOR: bustype=GIO module=gbd vector=0x0 unit=0         base=PHYS_TO_K1(0x1f400000) base2=0xBF410000         exprobe=(r,PHYS_TO_K1(0x1f400000),4,0x75,0xff)Note that the interrupt vector (vector=), the base addresses, and the probe address must all be specified in hexadecimal format. The base address and the address in the exprobe must agree. In the example above, lboot reads four bytes at probe address PHYS_TO_K1(0x1f400000) to determine whether the device is present in slot 0. In this example, base2 is used to point to the location of on-board memory.In actual use, it is advisable to add a second VECTOR line to the system file, to perform a probe of the other GIO slot. If only the line above had been used and the GIO device were physically placed in slot 1 rather than slot 0 as specified in the VECTOR line, the probe would fail, and the driver would not have been included in the kernel. Using this situation as an example, the following line must be added to the system file:VECTOR: bustype=GIO module=gbd vector=0x0 unit=0             base=0xBF600000 base2=0xBF610000         exprobe=(r,0xBF600000,4,0x75,0xff) This ensures that a GIO device placed in either slot will be recognized.After examining /usr/include/sys/major.h and looking for potential major device number conflicts in other device files in the /var/sysgen/master.d directory, you determine that major device number 51 is available and can be used for this device. You then create a master file, gbd, and enter:*FLAG     PREFIX    SOFT      #DEV       DEPENDENCIES

ID="chap68"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="22713"Writing edtinit()ID="chap69"If you use the VECTOR directive to configure a driver into the kernel, your driver can use a function of the form drvedtinit(), where drv is the driver prefix.

The name of this routine does not need to be drvintr(), since GIO uses setgiovector() to register interrupt routines. When the device generates an interrupt, the general GIO interrupt handler calls your driver's interrupt routine and passes it the unit number for the device. Within your interrupt routine, you must set flags to indicate the state of the transfer and wake up sleeping processes (if any) waiting on the transfer to complete. Usually, the interrupt routine calls iodone() to indicate that a block type I/O transfer for the buffer is complete.CautionInterrupt routines must not try to sleep themselves by calling iowait(), sleep(), psema(), or delay() kernel calls, nor should they try to access the per-process global variables in the u type structure directly. The u type structure they access may not be that of the process that made the I/O request.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="21375"Programmed I/O (PIO)When transferring large amounts of data, your device driver should use direct memory access (DMA). Using DMA, your driver can program a few registers, return, and put itself to sleep while it awaits an interrupt that indicates the transfer is complete. This frees up the processor for use by other processes.ID="chap613"ID="chap614"ID="chap615"However, sometimes you must write a driver for a device that does not support DMA. Even if a device does support DMA, you may not want to use DMA to transfer amounts of data so small that the DMA overhead is not warranted.In these non-DMA cases, the processor is used to copy data from user space to the device. Some device make additional operations on the data. These operations may then be triggered by writing to a register on the device, such as a printer or disk controller. Most such devices have a status register that is used to verify completion. Polling on an interrupt can be used, but it is expensive and should be used sparingly.Listed below is part of a mythical GIO device driver for a printer controller that does not support DMA. To print data from the user, the driver copies a number of bytes (as specified by uio_resid) from the uio_iov array to an on-board memory buffer of size GBD_MEMSIZE. Following the copy of each chunk, the driver programs the device registers to indicate the size of valid data in the memory and to tell the controller to start the printing.NoteBeginning with IRIX 5.0, direct access of the user structure u is not allowed. Instead, user data may be accessed only through the uio structure. For example, note that the field u.u_count is not found in this driver, and references are made to the uio_resid field only.The driver then sleeps, waiting for an interrupt to indicate that the printing is complete and that the on-board memory buffer is available again. To prevent a race condition, in which the interrupt responds before the calling process can sleep, the driver uses the ID="chap616"ID="chap617"splgio1() routine./* device write routine entry point (for character devices)*/
volatile int
gbdwrite(dev_t dev, uio_t *uio)

   int unit = geteminor(dev)&1;

      }

      splx(s);
   }
   return err;
}The driver's use of the ID="chap618"volatile declaration informs the optimizer that this register points to a hardware value that may change. Otherwise, the optimizer may determine that one write to gbd_device->command is sufficient.NoteIf your driver uses the ID="chap619"sleep() and ID="chap620"wakeup() kernel routines to sleep and awaken, it is a good idea for the drvintr() to verify that the actual event has occurred before actually awakening the sleeping process. (See sleep() for details on the sleep/wakeup process synchronization mechanism.) If your driver uses the iowait()/iodone() routines or the psema()/vsema() routines to sleep and awaken, you need not worry about it awakening by accident. However, the routines psema() and vsema() are specific to IRIX and are probably not supported on other operating systems.The uiomove() kernel routine is a useful procedure to call in these situations because it automatically updates the fields in the uio structure and uses copyout() (or copyin()) to check for invalid user addresses. Recall that uio_resid must be left with the number of bytes left untransferred.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="10599"DMA OperationsUse DMA (direct memory access) when the device supports it. In its simplest form, DMA is easy to use: your driver gives the device the physical memory address, and the transaction begins. Your driver can then put itself to sleep while it waits for the transfer to complete, thus freeing the processor for other tasks. When the transfer is complete, the device interrupts the processor. On most systems, when large amounts of data are involved, DMA devices obtain higher overall throughput than devices that do only PIO.DMA operations are categorized as ID="chap621"DMA reads or ID="chap622"DMA writes. DMA operations that transfer from memory to a device, and hence read memory, are DMA reads. DMA operations that transfer from a device to memory are DMA writes. Thus, you may want to think of DMA operations as being named the point of view is that of memory. There are some cache considerations for drivers using DMA. The cache architecture of the system dictates the appropriate cache operations. Write back caches require that data be written back from cache to memory before a DMA read, whereas both write back and write through caches require the cache to be invalidated before data from a DMA write is used. See ID="chap623"ID="chap624"ID="chap625"IDREF="12969" TYPE="TITLE""Data Cache Write Back and Invalidation" in Appendix A and the IDREF="dki_dcache_wbinval(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="dki_dcache_wbinval(D3X)"dki_dcache_wbinval(D3X)
 man page for a discussion of these issues.Another concern for driver writers is that DMA buffers may require cache-line alignment. To this end, when a driver allocates a buffer for DMA, it must use the kmem_allocID="chap626"() function with the KM_CACHEALIGN flag to obtain a buffer that is properly aligned.The interrupt service routine then calls your ID="chap627"drvintr routine. Your drvintr routine can confirm that the transfer is complete (if necessary), set flags indicating the status of the transfer, and then awaken the sleeping process.The GIO bus does not provide any address mapping registers. Any DMA operation that requires scatter/gather must be supported by GIO board hardware or a software implementation of scatter/gather.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="34402"Memory Parity WorkaroundsIf you are writing a GIO device driver for Indigo R4000, Indigo2, POWER Indigo2, or Indy systems, please make note of the following changes introduced in IRIX 5.3 (or IRIX 5.2 with Patch4, the Memory Parity Patch).ID="chap628"Beginning with IRIX 5.3, parity checking is enabled on the SysAD bus (see ID="chap629"ID="chap630"IDREF="19857" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-1). Unfortunately, with certain GIO cards, errors can occur if memory reads complete before the Memory Controller (MC) finishes calculating parity.FILE="Fig6-1.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="6-1"Figure 6-1 ID="19857"The SysAD Bus in ContextSome GIO cards do not drive all 32 GIO data lines during CPU PIO reads. These reads from the GIO card are either 8-bit (byte) or 16-bit (short word), so the lines are left floating. The problem is that to generate parity bits for the SysAD bus, the Memory Controller (MC) must calculate parity for all 32 bits. Since the calculation must occur before the CPU read completes, it is possible that one (or more) of the floating bits may change while parity is being calculated. Thus, when the CPU read completes, it may receive a parity error on the SysAD bus.CautionEven on GIO boards that do not drive all data lines, this problem may not show up on every transaction. It occurs only when one of the floating data lines changes state between the start of the MC parity calculation and the completion of the CPU read. Even if a driver appears to function correctly, the system may panic due to a parity error.If you are writing a driver for a GIO card that does not drive all 32 data lines, even when fewer bits are being read, you must either:Disable SysAD parity checking completely. This reduces the system's ability to recover from a parity error in main memory, but it is both reliable and easy to program. The way to implement this is simply to put a call to ID="chap631"disable_sysad_parity() at the beginning of your driver's init (or edtinit) routine before the driver attempts any PIO reads from the GIO device.Disable SysAD parity checking only when your driver is actually performing PIOs. The advantage here is that the software recovery procedures for memory parity errors are almost always in effect, but it requires a bit more work during driver development. Put wrappers around your driver's PIO transactions to disable SysAD parity checking before the transactions and re-enable it after the PIOs complete, as in the following code fragment:{
 int was_enabled = is_sysad_parity_enabled();

 if (was_enabled)
 disable_sysad_parity();

 /* do driver PIO transactions */

 if (was_enabled)
 enable_sysad_parity();

 }LBL="" HELPID=""ID="29011"GIO Devices with Hardware-supported Scatter/Gather CapabilityIDREF="55618" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Writing a Device Driver," tells you to use the physio() kernel routine to fault in and lock the physical pages corresponding to the user's buffer. ID="chap632"physio() also remaps these physical pages to a kernel virtual address that remains constant even when the user's virtual addresses are no longer mapped.Internally, physio() allocates a structure of type buf if you pass a NULL pointer. (physio() uses this structure to embody the transfer information.) physio() then calls your drvstrategy() routine and passes it a pointer to the buf type structure that it has allocated and primed. Your ID="chap633"drvstrategy() routine must then loop through each page, starting at the kernel virtual address, and load each device scatter/gather register in turn with the corresponding physical address. Use the kvtophys() routine to convert a kernel virtual address to a physical address.For example, suppose the mythical device is now a GIO device that has hardware-supporting scatter/gather. The scatter/gather registers for the device are simply a table of integers that store the physical pages corresponding to the current transfer. To start the transfer, the driver gives the device the beginning byte offset, byte count, and transfer direction. The code is:ID="chap634"/* Actual device setup for DMA, etc., if your board has

It introduces two system calls, mmap(2) and munmap(2),  as well as describing two IRIX driver functions, ID="chap71"drvmap() and ID="chap72"drvunmap() SVR4 also uses a drvmmap() function and an optional drvunmap() function.
. Because your driver allows the user to map the device user space, your driver may not need to include ID="chap73"drvread() and ID="chap74"drvwrite() functions.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="36632"Including a Memory-mapping Device Driver in the KernelFor a VME device driver, refer to IDREF="61787" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 3, "Writing a VME Device Driver," for details on adding a VME device driver to the kernel.For a EISA device driver, see IDREF="32625" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 4, "Writing an EISA Device Driver," for details on including this type of driver.For a SCSI device driver, refer to IDREF="83716" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Writing a SCSI Device Driver," for details on including this type of driver to the kernel.For a GIO device driver, see IDREF="22322" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 6, "Writing Kernel-level GIO Device Drivers," for details.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="94838"Mapping and Unmapping FunctionsThe functions for mapping memory and registers are mmap(), drvmmap(), munmap(), and v_mapphys().LBL="" HELPID=""mmap ≠ ID="23490"Mapping the Devicedrvmmap ≠ ID="23490"Mapping the DeviceWhen a user-level program wants to map device memory into its address space, the user program opens the special file corresponding to the particular device and uses the ID="chap75"mmap() system call.

fd = open(special_file, O_RDWR);
addr = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,             MAP_PRIVATE, fd, off);After the kernel performs basic sanity checking on the system call arguments, if the file descriptor passed to the mmap(2) system call represents a special file, the kernel looks in your driver object module and calls that device mapping function.Synopsisdrvmap(dev, vt, off, len, prot)       dev_t     dev;      /* device number*/       vhandl_t  *vt;      /* handle to caller's                            /* virtual address space */       off_t     off;      /* offset into device */       int       len;      /* # of bytes to map */       int       prot;     /* protections */ArgumentsdevGives your ID="chap77"drvmap() function the device major and minor numbers. Use the majorID="chap78" and minorID="chap79" macros to extract this information from dev.vtGives your drvmap function a pointer to the kernel-level data structure that describes the virtual space to which the device memory will be mapped. Your driver needs this pointer when calling certain kernel service functions.CautionYour driver must treat this pointer as an "opaque" handle and try not to set any of the member values directly. The specifics of this structure are likely to change from release to release. Your drvmap() function may change the member values of this structure indirectly, but only by calling kernel service functions.offThis offset within device memory, at which mapping begins, gives your drvmap() function the kernel's virtual address for the device.lenGives your drvmap() function the length of the device memory to be mapped into the user's address space.protGives your drvmap() function the protections that the user program specified when it called mmap().LBL="" HELPID=""munmap ≠ ID="35113"Unmapping the DeviceTo unmap a device, the user program calls the munmap(2) system call:munmap (ID="chap710"addr, len);where addr is the device virtual address returned by the mmap(2) function and len is the length of the mapped area. After performing device-independent unmapping in the user's space, the munmap(2) system call calls your driver's drvunmap() function if it is defined as an entry in the device switch table.Synopsisdrvunmap(dev, vt);
dev_t     dev;               /* device number */

Therefore, it is a good idea for your driver to provide a dummy unmapping function even if your driver does not need to perform any action to unmap the device.LBL="" HELPID=""v_mapphys ≠ ID="16442"Mapping Device Control Registers and On-board MemoryYour driver can allow the user to map device registers and local memory from the user's virtual space to physical memory if your driver's drvmap() function calls v_mapphys().Synopsisint v_mapphys(vt, addr, len);

              int len;ArgumentsvtYour drvmap() function must give this parameter the opaque handle to the user's virtual address space. (The internals of the structure for the opaque handle are likely to change from release to release.) addrYour drvmap() function must give this parameter the kernel virtual address by which the device is accessed. (See IDREF="27538" TYPE="TITLE""VME Slave Addressing" in Appendix A.) The system takes this address from the user's call to mmap(2) and hands it to the off parameter of your drvmap() function.lenYour drvmap() function must give this parameter the number of bytes to be mapped. The system takes this value from the user's call to mmap(2) and hands it to the len parameter of your drvmap() function.If successful, v_mapphys() returns 0. If v_mapphys() fails, it sets errno and returns -1. After a successful call to v_mapphys(), the device's registers at addr are mapped into the user's address space as designated by vt. You do not need any special unmapping, so the drvunmap() function does not need actions specified within it.CautionYour driver must be very careful when it maps device registers to a user process. It must carefully check the range of addresses that the user requests and make sure that the request references only the requested device. Because protection is available only up to a page boundary, configure the addresses of I/O cards so that they do not overlap a page. If they are allowed to overlap, an application process may be able to access more than one device, possibly a system device (for example, a disk controller or Ethernet). This can cause system secuity problems or other problems that are hard to diagnose.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="37620"Sharing Kernel Memory with a User ProgramTo allocate memory that is shared between the driver and the application process, your drvmap() function must do steps 1 and 2 of the procedure below. To free that memory later, your drvunmap() function must do step 3.Use the ID="chap711"kmem_alloc() kernel function to allocate some memory pages in the kernel:caddr_t *kaddr = kmem_alloc (len , KM_CACHEALIGN);Map the memory pages into the user's address space by calling ID="chap712"v_mapphys():v_mapphys (vt, kaddr, nbytes)To free the memory, your driver's unmapping function, drvunmap(), must call kmem_freeID="chap713"():kmem_free(kaddr, len);kmem_alloc() allocates physical memory and returns a kernel virtual address associated with that memory. The physical memory is not subject to paging. v_mapphys() returns 0 upon success and -1 upon failure. The parameters for these calls are:vtYour drvmap() function must give this parameter the opaque handle to the user virtual address space. (The internals of this structure are likely to change from release to release.) kaddrYour drvmap() function must give this parameter the virtual address returned by ID="chap714"kmem_alloc().

It contains the following sections:IDREF="82478" TYPE="TITLE""Preliminary Considerations"IDREF="51649" TYPE="TITLE""Shared Data between Upper-half and Interrupt Routines"IDREF="80470" TYPE="TITLE""Protecting Shared Data Among Upper-half Routines"IDREF="34260" TYPE="TITLE""Semaphore and Spinlock Calls"IDREF="69950" TYPE="TITLE""Multiprocessing STREAMS Drivers"By default, all upper-half device driver functionsname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'open(), close(), ioctl(), read(), write(), and strategy()name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]' and the interrupt function are forced onto processor 0 on a multiprocessor (MP) system. Therefore, a device driver written for a single processor will work unmodified on a multiprocessor system. To avoid context switches to processor 0 for every I/O call, you can modify a device driver to run on any processor. The process of making a device driver MP-safe is often called semaphoring, or multi-threading, a driver, although the preferred method relies, strictly speaking, on locks rather than on semaphores.NoteThe driver interface now uses the SVR4 MP DDI/DKI interface except for the Silicon Graphics-specific routines, such as pio_map() and dma_map(). For example, entry points such as open(), close(), read(), and write() all have slightly different arguments and, in some cases, different procedure types in 5.x than they had in earlier versions.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="82478"Preliminary ConsiderationsThe best way to develop a multiprocessor driver is to follow these steps:Implement and test a single-threaded version of the driver.Make the driver MP-safe with the use of the spinlock and semaphore calls described in this chapter.Test and debug this version of the driver. It must still work perfectly when forced onto processor 0.Add D_MP to the drvdevflag, recompile the driver, and rebuild the kernel with ID="chap81"lboot.This builds a kernel that no longer forces the upper-half routines onto processor 0; they are allowed to run on the current CPU instead.Run the device driver routines on an arbitrary processor to test and fix any bugs that have been exposed.Unfortunately, making a device driver MP-safe is not a mechanized procedure, but one that requires a good understanding of the driver and its data structures. When a driver is flagged as ID="chap82"semaphored, the driver writer must modify the code to prepare for two new scenarios:An upper-half routine may be executing on one processor while the interrupt procedure executes on another processor.ID="chap83"Upper-half routines may run concurrently on different processors. For example, a process on one processor can be executing an open procedure while another processor executes the strategy function.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="51649"Shared Data between Upper-half and Interrupt RoutinesIf the upper-half and interrupts use ID="chap84"biowait and ID="chap85"biodone for synchronization, the driver will perform as desired on both single-processor and multiprocessor systems. This is because these routines have already been made multiprocessor-safe. Often, however, an interrupt routine will synchronize with upper-half procedures by using the ID="chap86"ID="chap87"ID="chap88"sleep/wakeupID="chap89" functions and a shared flag word. The following is a common scenario:Upper-half routine:   s = splvme();
   flag |= WAITING;
   while (flag & WAITING) {
      sleep(&flag, PZERO);
   }
   splx(s);Interrupt routine:   if (flag & WAITING) {
      wakeup(&flag);
      flag &= ~WAITING;
   }The ID="chap810"splvme call is used to protect flag from being modified in an interrupt routine. The splvme call raises the interrupt priority level only on the current processor and is, thus, insufficient on a multiprocessor. In this case, semaphores can be used for synchronization. When you initialize a semaphore to 0, the first ID="chap811"psema call puts the calling process to sleep. A subsequent ID="chap812"IDREF="vsema(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="vsema(D3X)"vsema(D3X)
 call will put the process back on the run queue. See the IDREF="spl(D3)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="spl(D3)"spl(D3)
 man page.The following code can replace the upper-half and interrupt scenario above:ID="chap813"Initialization function:initnsema(&driversema, 0, "driver");Upper-half routine:psema(&driversema, PZERO);Interrupt routine:vsema(&driversema);Since the semaphore functions themselves are multiprocessor-safe, no additional locking is necessary.There may be other cases within the driver where data not specifically pertaining to synchronization is shared between an upper-half routine and an interrupt routine. You can identify these cases easily by searching for ID="chap814"splN/ID="chap815"splx calls and identifying the data actually being protected against concurrent access. In such cases, it is often useful to employ spinlocks. (They are called spinlocks because the locking functions actually loop until a test-and-set value is unset.) Replace the splN call with a LOCK(D3) call, and replace the ID="chap816"splx call with a corresponding UNLOCK(D3) call. These replacements allow the driver to perform as desired on a single processor while providing locking on a multiprocessor. See the ID="chap817"IDREF="spl(D3)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="spl(D3)"spl(D3)
 man page.ID="chap818"CautionData and cache interactions must be considered.Variables that might be in registers must be declared volatile and protected as well in multiprocessor device drivers.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="80470"Protecting Shared Data Among Upper-half RoutinesSince instances of the device open, close, ID="chap819"ioctl, read, write, and strategy functions may execute concurrently on a number of processors, all data that is shared among these routines must be protected. Unfortunately, you need to identify this data by careful examination of the driver code. It is not possible to look for all instances of certain procedure calls, as it is with the interrupt routine.You may use spinlock calls to protect shared data where the locks are held only for a short period of time. If a lock must be held for a longer period of time, you may use a semaphore initialized to 1. If this is the case, the first call to ID="chap820"psema is not blocked, but all succeeding calls are. When the lock is to be freed, a ID="chap821"IDREF="vsema(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="vsema(D3X)"vsema(D3X)
 call allows at most one process waiting for the semaphore to proceed. Semaphores involve slightly more overhead than spinlocks if the lock is free, and a great deal more overhead if the lock is held and the calling process must sleep. This may sound undesirable at first, but keep in mind that waiting on a locked spinlock ties up the processor from other work, while a process that puts itself to sleep allows the CPU to execute other processes. Thus, spinlock calls should be used only in situations where the lock will be held for a short duration.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="34260"Semaphore and Spinlock CallsThe remainder of this chapter is a listing of semaphore and spinlock calls. In each case, an example of the call precedes a brief explanation: LBL="" HELPID=""semapID="chap822"#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/sema.h>
void initnsema(sema_t *semap, int value, char *name);Allocate and initialize a semaphore addressed by semap, given value and name (for debugging).LBL="" HELPID=""freesemaID="chap823"void freesema(sema_t *semap);Free the semaphore addressed by semap.LBL="" HELPID=""psemaID="chap824"int psema(sema_t *semap, int priority);Decrement the current semaphore value by 1; if the semaphore value becomes less than 0, sleep at the given priority. The priority is the same as that given to sleep. The flag bit PCATCH may be bit-wise ORed into the priority if the sleep is breakable (greater than PZERO) and it is desired to catch the signal (as is usually the case).The call may be prefixed with ap if the call is to be a NOP on single processors. This is often the case when the semaphore is used for locking.This function returns 0 in normal operation or -1 if PCATCH is specified and a signal interrupted the sleep.LBL="" HELPID=""vsemaID="chap825"int vsema(sema_t *semap);Increment the current semaphore value by 1; if the result is less than or equal to 0, place a process sleeping on the semaphore onto the run queue. As above, the call may be prefixed with ap if the call is to be a NOP on single processors.This function returns 0 if no process is waiting on the semaphore, or 1 if a process is awakened.LBL="" HELPID=""cpsemaID="chap826"int cpsema(sema_t *semap);This call conditionally provides the functionality of the psema operation. If the semaphore count is already less than 0, the function does not affect the semaphore value and simply returns 0. Otherwise, the semaphore count is decremented.NoteIn no case does the calling process sleep; this function can be useful to test whether a given lock has been acquired.LBL="" HELPID=""cvsemaID="chap827"int cvsema(sema_t *semap);This function wakes up a process on the semaphore if there is one.

The kernel takes care of acquiring the monitor before running any of the regular STREAMS entry point routines. However, the device driver writer needs to take care of the  interrupt entry points (hardware interrupt and timeouts) with ID="chap838"ID="chap839"IDREF="streams_interrupt(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="streams_interrupt(D3X)"streams_interrupt(D3X)
 and IDREF="STREAMS_TIMEOUT(D3X)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="STREAMS_TIMEOUT(D3X)"STREAMS_TIMEOUT(D3X)
. For more detailed information, see the man pages for these two calls.LBL="" HELPID=""STREAMS MonitorThe STREAMS monitor ensures mutually exclusive access to STREAMS on multiprocessor systems. The STREAMS put, service, open, and close functions are guaranteed to have the monitor upon entry and, thus run with assured mutual exclusion. The kernel handles all monitor interactions for these procedures, although it does not acquire the monitor for STREAMS driver interrupt routines, which must acquire the monitor explicitly.All STREAMS drivers must acquire the monitor before performing any interaction with STREAMS from interrupt level, such as quenable(), getq(), or putq(). To obtain the monitor from an interrupt routine, the driver should call:int streams_interrupts (func,arg1,arg2,arg3)This routine either:Acquires the monitor and runs func with arguments of arg1, arg2, and arg3, then releases the monitor and returns 1orQueues the function on the monitor for execution once the current owner of the monitor releases it, and immediately returns 0. The example below shows how a STREAMS driver could use streams_interrupt().There are additional changes for STREAMS drivers that use calls to timeout() and delay(), which corrupt the mutual exclusion of the monitor. To make these calls safe, the device driver writer must replace them with macros defined in the include file sys/strmp.h. Replace all calls to timeout() with the macro STREAMS_TIMEOUT(); replace all calls to delay() with the macro STREAMS_DELAY(). For example, if the single-processor version of a driver contains the following calls:timeout(watchdog,unit,HZ/10);and delay(100);they should be replaced by:STREAMS_TIMEOUT(watchdog,unit,HZ/10;and STREAMS_DELAY(100);These macros revert to the original timeout() and delay() calls in the single processor case. The include file sys/strmp.h also defines the constant MP_STREAMS if the multiprocessor version of STREAMS is in use. This is useful for performing conditional compilation of sections of the STREAMS driver for multiprocessor systems. In any case, the use of these macros and definitions makes the driver machine-dependent.LBL="" HELPID=""STREAMS Example#include "sys/strmp.h"

In particular, it describes how to write an IRIX kernel ifnet interface networking device driver. Only issues specific to IRIX are covered here; this section does not describe the complete ifnet programmatic interfaces to the system although the sources for a sample skeleton ifnet device driver are included at the end of this section.Refer to the following books for more complete information on the BSD kernel protocol stack and device driver conventions:Egan, Janet I., and Thomas J.

IRIX 5.3 and IRIX 6.0, although divergent, accept device drivers that have run on IRIX 5.x. NoteA forthcoming release, IRIX 6.x, will represent a convergence of the two operating systems (32- and 64-bit). It is expected to be easier, as well as more time-efficient, in many cases, to postpone the development of new network device drivers until IRIX 6.x becomes available.CautionInformation in this chapter is subject to change without notice.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="40659"IRIX Kernel Networking DesignThe IRIX kernel networking design is based on the kernel networking framework in 4.3BSD. If you are familiar with the 4.3BSD kernel networking design, then you are already familiar with the IRIX kernel networking design because they are basically the same.The IRIX networking design is based on the socket interface: mbufs are used to exchange messages within the kernel, and device drivers support the TCP/IP internet protocol suite by supporting the ifnet interface.Since the kernel BSD-based networking framework and TCP/IP internet protocol suite implementation have changed little from previous releases of IRIX, porting your ifnet device driver to IRIX 5.3 from earlier releases of IRIX should be simple and straightforward.IDREF="37039" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 9-1 displays the basic IRIX kernel networking architecture.FILE="Fig9-1.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="9-1"Figure 9-1 ID="37039"IRIX 5.3 Kernel Network ArchitectureThe left side of the figure shows the native socket-based TCP/IP protocol code, socket layer, and ifnet-based device drivers. This portion comes bundled in the basic IRIX system. Socket-based applications such as rlogin, rcp, NFS client and server, and the socket-based RPC library operate directly over this native networking framework.The middle of the figure shows the optionally installed svr4net package, which provides compatibility support for user-level applications written to the STREAMS Transport Layer Interface (TLI). ID="chap91"tpisocket is a kernel library module used by protocol-specific STREAMS pseudo-drivers, such as ID="chap92"tpitcp, tpiudpID="chap93", and so on, providing a TPI interface above the native kernel sockets-based network protocol stack.The right side of the figure shows the optionally installed dlpi package which provides a STREAMS pseudo-driver that supports the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) for STREAMS-based kernel protocol stacks.Refer to the IRIX Network Programming Guide and the SVR4 man pages for STREAMS, TLI, and DLPI programming information.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="10129"ifnet Driver InterfacesThe interface definitions and contents of the following #include files are subject to change without notice. While the policy is to avoid or minimize driver modifications required as new releases of IRIX become available, no guarantees of source or binary compatibility between releases of the operating system are made for networking drivers.The primary ifnet data structure and routines to manipulate this are defined in net/if.h. They are augmented with interface types defined in net/if_types.h.Functions and macros to allocate, manipulate, and free mbufs are defined in sys/mbuf.h.The function schednetisr to schedule a kernel software interrupt routine, related macros, and a declaration for the IP input queue ipintrq are defined in net/netisr.h.Constants and structures for support of the raw protocol family are defined in net/raw.h.Routines defining a generic filter for use by network interfaces whose devices cannot perfectly filter multicast packets are declared in net/multi.h.DLPI interface support routines and structure definitions are in sys/dlsap_register.h.Socket interface ioctl definitions are in net/soioctl.h.Ethernet and ARP-related data structures and function prototypes are provided in netinet/if_ether.h.LBL="" HELPID=""Multiprocessor IssuesPrior to IRIX 5.3, the kernel BSD framework code and TCP/IP protocol executed under a single kernel lock on multiprocessor systems making it a single-threaded implementation. In IRIX 5.3, the BSD framework and TCP/IP protocol suite have been multi-threaded to support symmetric multiprocessing by the addition of kernel locks protecting critical sections. It now supports multiple, concurrent threads of execution within the TCP/UDP/IP protocol suite, kernel socket layer, and bundled networking device drivers.These changes are transparent to user-level programs, but, if you've written your own ifnet-based networking driver, it requires minor source-level changes in order to run in IRIX 5.3.In a multi-threaded kernel, raising the processor interrupt level (IPL) by calling one of the spl routines, such as splimp() or splnet(), blocks interrupts from occurring on the local processor; it does not prevent interrupts from occurring on other processors in the system, nor does it prevent other processes on other processors from executing code in your critical section.Under BSD networking, drivers interface with the protocol stacks by queueing the incoming packets on a per-protocol input queue. On multiprocessor systems, this protocol input queue must be protected by the locking macros defined in the file net/if.h.All the locking macros that protect the input queue are assumed to be called at the proper processor masking level, splimp. All input queue locking macros also take an input parameter ifq, which is a pointer to the protocol input queue that must be defined as a struct ifqueue.LBL="" HELPID=""Compilation Flags for MP TCP/IPFor IRIX 5.3, the following flag must be defined in order to enable the macros necessary to run under multi-threaded TCP/IP:-D_MP_NETLOCKS -DMPLBL="" HELPID=""IFNET_LOCK(ID="chap94"ID="chap95"ifp, s)Network driver interrupt handlers should call this macro to protect critical data structures against system calls that try to access the same data structures on other processors. This macro acquires the lock that is part of the driver ifnet structure pointed to by ifp. s is the return value of the processor interrupt mask. The lock is held at splimp level. The multiprocessor TCP/IP locking scheme in IRIX 5.3 automatically holds this lock when the system enters the driver via a system call. The lock is be released automatically upon returning from the driver to synchronize simultaneous accesses to the driver from multiple processors.LBL="" HELPID=""IFNET_UNLOCK(ID="chap96"ID="chap97"ifp,s) This macro is the reverse of IFNET_LOCK, IFNET_UNLOCK is used to release the lock. s is the value previously returned by IFNET_LOCK().LBL="" HELPID=""IFNET_LOCKNOSPL(ID="chap98"ID="chap99"ifp)This macro is similar to IFNET_LOCK but assumes that splimp has been called previously.LBL="" HELPID=""IFNET_UNLOCKNOSPL(ID="chap910"ID="chap911"ifp)This macro is similar to IFNET_UNLOCK but does not lower the spl.LBL="" HELPID=""IFQ_LOCK/UNLOCK(ID="chap912"ID="chap913"ifq)This macro acquires/releases the lock, which is part of the input queue.LBL="" HELPID=""IF_ENQUEUE(ID="chap914"ID="chap915"ifq, m)This macro acquires the lock on ifq and appends the packet pointed to by the mbuf m.

 * Locking strategy:
 * IFNET_LOCK() and IFNET_UNLOCK() acquire/release the

 * IFQ_UNLOCK() acquire/release the lock on a given ifqueue
 * structure. The ifnet or ifqueue lock must be held while
 * modifying any fields within the associated data
 * structure. The ifnet lock is also held to singlethread
 * portions of the device driver. The driver xxinit,
 * xxreset, xxoutput, xxwatchdog, and xxioctl entry points
 * are called with IFNET_LOCK() already acquired thus only
 * a single thread of execution is allowed in these
 * portions of the driver for each interface. It is the

 * other critical sections.  It is also the driver's
 * responsibility to acquire the ifq lock by calling
 * IFQ_LOCK() before attempting to enqueue onto the IP

LBL="10"ID="57559"Driver Installation and Testing This chapter explains how to use symmon, the kernel debugger. It contains the following sections:IDREF="32442" TYPE="TITLE""Making a Debuggable Kernel"IDREF="33580" TYPE="TITLE""Making an ASCII Terminal the Console"IDREF="40053" TYPE="TITLE""Invoking symmon"IDREF="30441" TYPE="TITLE""Displaying and Changing Registers"IDREF="26133" TYPE="TITLE""Using symmon Commands"IDREF="34987" TYPE="TITLE""Multiprocessor Debugging"NoteThis program requires an ASCII terminal on the first serial port.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="18282"Using the Kernel DebuggerLike all software, the IRIX kernel needs a reliable debugging tool. This chapter describes the kernel debugger, symmon(1), an indispensable tool for debugging device driver software. symmon(1) and the other kernel debugging tools are not automatically loaded during installation. To put these tools onto your system, install the subsystem eoe2.sw.kdebug manually from your software release CD-ROMs.You can load symmon(1) coresident with a standalone program or operating system, then use symmon(1) to control the execution of that program or operating system. symmon(1) gives you commands to examine and alter memory and registers, set breakpoints, and execute programs.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="32442"Making a Debuggable KernelTo make a kernel that you can debug from symmon(1), you need to create a kernel slightly different from the standard one. Use the following steps (many of which you used when you added a device driver to the kernel) to create a debuggable kernel.Become root:% suEdit /var/sysgen/system/irix.sm.Change the line:EXCLUDE idbgtoINCLUDE idbgFind the two lines containing LDOPTS toward the end of the file. Comment out the uncommented lines and remove the comment marker for the currently commented out lines. (To comment out a line, put an asterisk character in the first column.)Make a note of the change. When you are finished debugging, undo the change so that you can make a standard kernel.Copy the current kernel to a safe place before rebooting.# cp /unix /unix.orig or# ln /unix /unix.origRun /etc/autoconfig and answer yes if prompted.Use halt to bring the system down. When you issue the halt command, the system overwrites the current kernel, /unix, with the kernel you have just created, /unix.install.# haltOn IRIS-4D/100, 4D/200, 4D/300, and 4D/400 Series workstations, set the front panel dip switches as shown in IDREF="41811" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 10-1.CautionFor these workstations, you must not use any odd-numbered port connected to a CPU for data transfer because an inadvertent <ctrl-A> in the data stream can put the system into symmon. This is true of any odd-numbered port not connected to a 6-port serial card.Personal IRIS, Indigo, Indigo2, Indy, Crimson, CHALLENGE/Onyx, and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx systems do not require physical switches for kernel debugging.FILE="Fig10-1.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="10-1"Figure 10-1 ID="41811"IRIS Front Panel Dip SwitchesAfter halting the system, push the <Reset> button to force the processor to read the switches.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="33580"Making an ASCII Terminal the ConsoleTo use the kernel debugger, you must install an ASCII terminal as the system console. If you do not install an ASCII terminal as the system console, you can still use the newly built kernel under your normal configuration, but you cannot use the kernel debugger. Some systems (IRIS-4D/20, -4D/25, -4D/30, -4D/35, Indigo, Indigo2, Indy, and Crimson) allow you to use the graphics text port when the window system is not running. symmon may fail occasionally in this configuration, but it can be useful when no ASCII terminal is available.To install an ASCII terminal as the system console:Connect the terminal to Serial Port 1 for a single processor (or to the appropriate port number for multiprocessor systems).Shut the system down in an orderly fashion.Select the Command Monitor mode from the Bootstrap menu.Type the following from the Command Monitor mode:setenv console dinitAt this point, all console input and output occur on the ASCII terminal. Boot the system as usual. The kernel loads and, because the kernel includes the module idbg(), symmon() loads automatically from the root disk volume header partition for those systems where it is not part of the PROM.NoteAlthough kernel output normally appears in a graphics window once graphics are started, the debugger still uses the ASCII terminal. The interactive version of symmon, called idbgID="chap101", uses the same commands as symmon but does not stop the system from processing and does not require an ASCII terminal. You can use idbg to look at variables but not to set them. (See IDREF="28183" TYPE="TITLE""Using symmon's Kernel Print Command".)LBL="" HELPID=""ID="40053"Invoking symmonOnce symmon(1) is loaded, control is transferred to the kernel. Control transfers to symmon(1) in any of the following ways:From the console, press <ctrl-A>Notesymmon can also be invoked from any odd-numbered CPU port on IP5 and IP7 systems, except for the IRIS-4D/210.Set the dbgstop environment variable from command mode before booting the kernel. (You cannot use kernel symbols at this point, but all other functions work.) To do so, set the dbgstop environment variable:> setenv dbgstop 1This transfers control to symmon(1) early in system startup. (Symbolic debugging is not enabled at this point.)Set the symstop environment variable from command mode before booting the kernel:> setenv symstop 1This transfers control to symmon(1) after the symbol table has been loaded but early in the system startup procedure.Insert a call to the debug(uchar_t *msg) service from a known location within your kernel.The IRIX kernel executes a breakpoint instruction.A system panic occurs.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="30441"Displaying and Changing Registerssymmon(1) provides commands that allow you to display and alter the processor and coprocessor general-purpose registers. To identify a general-purpose register (there are 32 registers, numbered 0 through 31), you can use names such as "r0" or "r31," or you can use the compiler usage names (in some cases, you may need to prepend a "$").

After symmon executes the kp command, it returns to dbgmon mode.Use symmon's dgbmon mode when you need ordinary debugger commands such as brk, dump, get. Use symmon's KP mode when you want to view kernel structures and other information.LBL="" HELPID=""Help for symmon CommandsTo see a listing of messages concerning the symmon commands while running symmon, type a question mark (?) and press <Enter>. In addition, commands that require arguments give a usage summary if you enter the command without arguments.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="19253"symmon's dbgmon Mode CommandsThis section describes the commands of symmon's dbgmon mode. Each heading lists the name of the command, its option flags, and its arguments. The headings use square brackets to indicate optional arguments and option flags. Following each heading is text that describes the purpose of the command. Following the command description are descriptions of each argument or option flag (if any). Different systems and operating system releases may have slightly different commands or options.

You can also set special-purpose registers and the system coprocessor registers (see IDREF="92447" TYPE="TABLE"Table 10-2).To specify the pc register, use the entry point of a client routine as the location argument.valueUse this argument to specify the hexadecimal value you want to write to the specified memory location or register (value is always assumed to be hexadecimal.)LBL="" HELPID=""sleep CommandID="chap1019"Use sleep to put a processor into the waiting loop on multiprocessing systems. To awaken the sleeping processor, use the wake command. On IRIS-4D 100/200/300/400 Series workstations, do not use this command on CPU 0.SynopsissleepLBL="" HELPID=""s [count] and S [count]ID="chap1020"Both s and S allow you to execute one or more instructions of client code. These two commands differ only in the way they handle jal and bal, instructions that execute subroutines.When S executes an instruction that calls a subroutine, it executes the entire subroutine as a single instruction, up to and including the return instruction. S fails to regain control if the subprocedure does not return.When s executes an instruction that calls a subroutine, it counts the jump to the subroutine as a single instruction, then executes instructions within that subroutine up to the number you have specified (minus the one counted when executing the jump instruction). If you specify only one instruction (the default), and the next instruction calls a subroutine, s jumps to the subroutine and stops.Synopsiss [count]S [count]Arguments[count] Use this optional argument to specify the number of instructions you want s or S to execute. The default is 1.LBL="" HELPID=""string CommandID="chap1021"Use this command to display memory as a null-terminated ASCII string.

The default behavior is to display the entire contents of tlb. The three formats for range are:baserange is a hexadecimal value. An index into tlb. tlbdump displays the contents of this single location.base#countrange is a table index followed by a number "#" character, followed by a count value. tlbdump displays the contents of a range of count tlb entries starting at the tlb entry whose index is base. Both base and count are hexadecimal values.base:limitrange is a table index followed by a colon ":" character, followed by an upper limit index. Use this format to display a range of tlb entries whose indices are greater than or equal to base, but less than limit. These index values are all hexadecimal values.LBL="" HELPID=""tlbflush CommandID="chap1023"Use tlbflush to flush mappings from the R2000/3000/4000 address translation buffer, thus making them invalid, not matching any possible address/pid pair. You can use this command to clear translations for both symmon and the client process.Synopsistlbflush [range]Arguments[range] Use this optional argument to specify the range of tlb entries that you want to flush. If you do not specify a range, tlbflush defaults to clearing all tlb entries. To specify a [range], use one of the following formats:NoteMultiprocessor systems have an address translation buffer associated with each processor. A command that dumps or changes translation buffers affects only the processor associated with the debug terminal from which such commands issued.LBL="" HELPID=""tlbmap CommandID="chap1024"Use tlbmap to establish a virtual to physical address map in the R2000/3000/4000 translation buffer.

If you do not know the names of the kernel structures or summaries that you want to see, just issue the kp command without specifying an argument. If you do not specify an argument for kp, the command displays the names of all its subcommands. The ?? command lists the names of all the kp subcommands with short descriptions. For systems that do not have symmon in PROM, you may omit the leading "kp".Some of the information you can view using the kp command is not of interest to you when debugging device drivers. In the following sections, we describe only those structures and summaries useful when debugging a device driver. kp commands that display data are also used with the idbg command (without the kp keyword).NoteThe following sections mention a number called the "process table entry index." This number is not the process ID. To find the process table entry index that corresponds to a particular process ID, issue the command: kp plist proc_id, where proc_id is the process ID for which you want to find the process table entry index.LBL="" HELPID=""kp buf [index/address] ≠ View a buf StructureID="chap1032"The kernel can contain any number of ID="chap1033"buf type structures. Use these structures to manage data transfers to and from a device. To view all of these structures, use kp buf without specifying [index/address]. To see a particular buf type structure, specify either the buffer index number for the structure or the address for the buf type structure as the [index/address] argument.LBL="" HELPID=""kp eframe addressID="chap1034"This displays the exception frame at the given address. The exception frame holds the contents of the general purpose registers at the time the process last executed.

To see the plist information that applies to a particular process, specify the process ID as the [#] argument. Thus, to see the plist information that applies to a process with a pid of 16672, enter the command:% kp plist 16672The information that kp plist [#] displays for a process consists of items such as:process table entry number, or index (also known as the process slot number). You use this number, instead of the pid, when selecting process-specific information from other kernel structures via kp, so be careful not to confuse it with the pid.process IDprocess status (such as sleep)LBL="" HELPID=""kp pda [index] ≠ View a pda StructureID="chap1042"The pda structure contains information about a processor's private data area. If you do not specify [index], kp pda gives you the pda structure for all the processors. To see the pda structure for a specific processor only, use the [index] argument to specify the processor array index for that processor. The value of this argument must be 0 on a single-processor system or a number between 0 and n on a multiprocessor system.LBL="" HELPID=""kp proc index/address ≠ View a proc StructureID="chap1043"A proc structure contains process-specific information not listed in the plist summaries. kp requires that you specify the proc structure you want to see. You can specify a particular proc structure by giving either the process table entry number (index) for the process or the address (address) for the proc structure (in u.u_proc.p for the currently mapped process).LBL="" HELPID=""kp qbuf device ID="chap1044"Dump the contents of buffers queued for the given device. The device argument is given as the major/minor device number of the desired device.LBL="" HELPID=""kp runq ≠ View the runq StructureID="chap1045"The runq structure contains information describing the processes in the run queue. These are processes that are not running but that could run. kp runq displays all the information for every process in the runq structure.LBL="" HELPID=""kp sema address ≠ View a Semaphore StructureID="chap1046"The system uses sema type structures to manage the information associated with a semaphore (for example, the semaphore's name, the number of times it was used, whether it is free or locked). Use kp sema address to list the contents of a particular sema structure.LBL="" HELPID=""kp slpproc ≠ View Summary of Sleeping ProcessesID="chap1047"Use this command to view information on all sleeping processes. This information includes such items as the process name, the process address, and the name and address of the semaphore upon which the process is sleeping. kp slpproc lists all the information in the slpproc structure.LBL="" HELPID=""kp ubt [index] ≠ View Subroutine Backtrace SummaryID="chap1048"Use this command to view subroutine backtrace information for a user process. This information includes such items as the stack pointer, the caller, and the called function. If you do not specify [index], this command reports on the currently mapped user process. To specify a particular user process (one that may or may not currently be mapped) give kp ubt [index], the index into the process table for the user process in which you are interested.CautionIf a process is currently running on a CPU, you must issue the ubt command on the CPU the process is running on. Using ubt # on currently running process will produce erroneous results.kp ubt [index] is analogous to the dbx command, where.LBL="" HELPID=""kp user [index] ≠ View a User StructureID="chap1049"The user structure contains information that describes a user area. If you do not specify [index], kp user displays the user structure for the currently mapped user. To view the user structure for a particular process (one that may or may not currently be mapped), give kp user [index], the index into the process table for the user process in which you are interested.LBL="" HELPID=""kp wd ≠ View SCSI InformationID="chap1050"Use kp WD93 to view information concerning WD93 SCSI devices.Synopsiskp wd [0, 1, 2, address] Arguments0Use this option to display the contents of the WD93 registers.

There are two phases: debugging multiprocess code forced to run on a single processor, followed by debugging the same code as it runs on multiple processors.LBL="" HELPID=""Configuring the System SoftwareTo force a multiprocess device driver to run on one processor only, you must deactivate all but one processor. Currently, network load is spread across CPUs by default. To preempt network packet processing, see the rtnetd(1M) and network(1M) man pages.LBL="" HELPID=""Preparing the System HardwareOn IRIS-4D and POWER Series systems, multiprocessor debugging requires that you connect an ASCII terminal to each processor. On a two-processor system, the second terminal connects to Serial Port 3. For four-processor systems, the additional terminals connect to ports 5 and 7. Additionally, you must set the MODE switches 4 and 8 (located at the front of the 4D system panel) to "open." When these MODE switches are open, power-on diagnostics display on the terminal attached to each processor. symmon loads automatically on all non-console processors, and each prints a message to its terminal. The mode switches are depicted in IDREF="13211" TYPE="TABLE"Table 10-1.NoteIndigo, Indigo2, Indy, Crimson, CHALLENGE/Onyx, POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx systems do not require physical manipulation of MODE switches.LBL="" HELPID=""symmon and Multiprocessor DebuggingOn multiprocessor systems, a separate symmon runs on each processor. Breakpoints, however, are shared. When a processor reaches a breakpoint instruction, control is transferred to the symmon associated with that processor. Other processors may continue to run independently until they also happen to hit that breakpoint, which can happen if you set a breakpoint in a kernel function or anywhere in a multiprocessor device driver.At this point, before the kernel is loaded (through a boot command from command mode), you can disable processors not associated with the console (the console processor is referred to as the ID="chap1051"master processor) by pressing the <Enter> key on the keyboard. Disabling processors is useful during the initial debugging phase of a multiprocess program because it is easier to debug a multiprocess program first in single-processor mode. This way, you eliminate the usual sorts of bugs before you have to deal with bugs associated specifically with multiprocessing (such as synchronization bugs). (See also M. Maekawa, A. Oldehoeft, and R. Oldehoeft. Operating Systems Advanced Concepts. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1987 and A. Silberschatz, J. Peterson, and P. Galvin. Operating System Concepts, Third Edition. Addison Wesley Publishing Company, 1991.)By default, all device driver software runs only on the master processor. A driver that understands the multiprocessor environment can indicate that it contains semaphored code through a flag in the master file. However, it is still easier to debug drivers initially on a single-processor system.If you do not disable the non-master processors, processes run on them as usual. If a breakpoint is encountered on that (non-master) processor, or if a <ctrl-A> character sequence is entered on that (non-master) processor's terminal, control transfers to symmon on that processor. Other processors continue to execute kernel (and user) code until they detect a <ctrl-A> character sequence, reach a break instruction, or hit a lock or semaphore held by the stopped CPU.Debugging on CHALLENGE/Onyx and POWER CHALLENGE/POWER Onyx systems requires only a single ASCII terminal. All symmon output for all CPUs is multiplexed to the one port. To talk to an individual CPU, use the cpu# command. CPUs must be stopped (with the stop command) before you can connect to them. To restart all CPUs, use the C all command.

Kernel modules can be registered and then loaded automatically by the kernel when the corresponding device is opened, or they can be loaded using either the lboot or the ml command. Similarly, dynamically loaded modules can be unloaded from the kernel automatically or manually if the module includes an "unload" entry point. Loadable kernel modules that are supported include: character, block, and STREAMS device drivers; STREAMS modules; library modules; and the idbg.o module. This chapter describes how to configure and use dynamically loadable kernel modules.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="98209"Module ConfigurationEach loadable module must contain the string shown below, where M_VERSION is defined in the mload.h header file that must be included by the loadable module:char *drvmversion = M_VERSION;A loadable module must be compiled and linked with the following ID="chap114"cc options before it can be loaded into the kernel: No driver written for IRIX 6.0 should use the -coff flag.% cc -non_shared -coff -Wx,-G0 -Wc,-pic0 -r -d -c -Wc,-jalr-non_sharedProduce a static executable. The output object created does not use any shared objects during execution.-coffProduce a COFF object.-Wx,-G0Disable global pointer. Not supported for loadable modules.-Wc,-pic0Do not allocate extra stack space that is not necessary for non_shared coff objects.-rRetain relocation entries in the output file.-dForce definition of common storage and define loader-defined symbols. Without this option, space is not allocated in bss for common variables.-cSuppress the compilation loading phase and force an object file to be produced even if only one program is compiled.-Wc,-jalrForce the compiler to produce jalr instructions rather than jal instructions. A jal instruction has a 26-bit target, so if a module is loaded into k2seg, for example, it could not call a kernel function in k0seg.A loadable module must not be dependent on any loadable module, other than a library module. In order to load a module comprised of multiple object files, the object files must be linked into a single object file, using ld with the following options:1% ld -non_shared -coff -G0 -r -dFor more information, see the cc(1) and ld(1) man page entries.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="96954"Using a Dynamically Loadable Kernel ModuleYou can use either lboot or the ml command to load, register, unload, unregister, and list loadable kernel modules. TheID="chap115" lboot command parses module type, prefix, and major number information from the module's master file in the /var/sysgen/master.d directory. The loadable object file is expected to be found in the /var/sysgen/boot directory. The ml command also provides a means of loading, registering, and unloading loadable modules, without the having to create a master file or reconfigure the kernel.LBL="" HELPID=""LoadWhen a module is loaded, the following operations take place:The object file's header is read.Memory is allocated for the module's text, data, and bss.The module's text and data are read.The module's text and data are relocated, and unresolved references into the kernel are resolved.A symbol table is created for the module; the module is added into the appropriate kernel switch table.The module's drvinit() function is called.Space allocated for the module's text, data, and bss is located in either k0seg or k2seg. Static buffers in loadable modules are not necessarily physically contiguous in memory.A module can be loaded using the following lboot command:% lboot -L masterA module can also be loaded using the following ml command:% ml ld -[v] -[cbBfm] module.o -p prefix \ [-s major major...] [-a modname]If a major number is specified by the ml command, that major number must match the major number used to create the corresponding device in /dev. If a major number is not specified, a device needs to be created in /dev with the major number selected by the ml command. The major number selected by the ml command can be found by using the ml list command described below. For more information about creating devices, see the mknod(1M) man page entry.If a module is loaded successfully by the ml command, an id number, which can be used to unload the module, is returned.LBL="" HELPID=""RegisterA register command is used to register a module for loading when its corresponding device is opened. When a module is registered, a stub function is entered into the appropriate kernel switch table. When the corresponding device is opened, the stub function loads the module into the kernel.A module can be registered with the following lboot command:% lboot -R <master>A module can also be registered with the following ml command:% ml ld [-v] -[cbBfm] module.o -p prefix [-s major...] \ [-a modname] [-t autounload_delay]If a module is registered successfully with the ml command, an id number, which can be used to unregister the module, is returned.LBL="" HELPID=""UnloadA module can be unloaded only if it provides an "unload" entry point, described in IDREF="85457" TYPE="TITLE""Module Entry Points."

The d flag indicates to lboot that the module is a dynamically loadable kernel module. If the ID="chap118"d flag is present, lboot parses the module's master file but does not fill in the entry in the corresponding kernel switch table for the module. All global data defined in the master file are included in the master.c file generated by lboot. The kernel must be configured with master files that contain the d option for each module that will be a dynamically loadable module, if ID="chap119"lboot is used to load, register, unload, unregister, or autoregister the module. If the ml command is used, then it is not necessary to create a master file for the module.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="43242"Auto RegistrationLoadable modules can be registered by ID="chap1110"lboot automatically at system startup, when autoconfig is run. For a module to be auto-registered, its master file must contain an R in the FLAG field in addition to d, which indicates that the module is loadable. When lboot runs at system startup, it registers each module that contains an R in its master file.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="13633"Auto UnloadAll registered modules that include an unload routine are automatically unloaded after last close unless they have been configured not to do so. By default, modules are unloaded five minutes after last close. You can change the default auto-unload delay by using systune to modify the module_unld_delay variable. For more information about systune, see the systune (1M) man page entry. To configure a particular module with a specific auto-unload delay, use the ml command. To configure a module so that it is not auto-unloaded, place an N in the flags filed of its master.d file, if it is registered using lboot; otherwise, use ml to register the module, then use the -t option.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="91830"Kernel ConfigurationA kernel that supports loadable modules must be configured so that the kernel switch tables generated by lboot contain "extra" entries for the loadable modules.

It should not call any routines that would cause it to sleep, such as biowait(), sleep(), psema(), or delay().LBL="" HELPID=""ID="98032"Module InitializationAfter a module is loaded and linked into the kernel, and sanity checking is done, the module's initialization routines, drvinit(), drvedtinit(), and drvstart(), are called, if they exist. For more information on these routines, refer to the SVR4 DDI/DKI Reference Manual and the IRIX Device Driver Reference Pages.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="46974"Edt Type DriversDrivers that have an edtinit entry point are passed a pointer to an edt structure. You must use lboot to load these drivers. Add a vector line to the system file for the driver. When the module is loaded using lboot, lboot parses the vector line from the system file to create an edt structure, which is passed through the kernel and to the driver's edtinit routine. The driver's edtinit routine is called after the driver is successfully loaded, after the driver's init routine is called. For more information, see the system(4) man page.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="85634"ID="80972"Library ModulesA library module is a module that contains a collection of functions and data that other loaded modules can link against. A library module that contains an init function calls it automatically after the module is loaded and linked into the kernel. To load a library module, use the ml command:% ml ld [-v] -[l] library.oA library module must be loaded before other modules that link against it are loaded. Library modules cannot be unloaded, registered, or unregistered. Only regular COFF object files are supported as loadable library modules.ID="chap1114"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="26091"Loadable Modules and Hardware InventoryMany device drivers add to the hardware inventory in their init or edtinit routines. If a driver is a dynamically loadable driver and is auto-registered, it will not show up in the hardware inventory until the driver has been loaded on the first open of the corresponding device. If a clean install or a diskless install is done, a /dev entry will not be created by MAKEDEV for such a driver, since it does not appear in the hardware inventory. If this situation arises, the D master.d flag can be used to indicate that the driver should be loaded, then unloaded, by autoconfig. If the R master.d flag, which indicates that the driver should be auto-registered, is also used, then the driver will be auto-registered as usual. A startup script can then be added to run MAKEDEV after autoconfig, if necessary. For an example, see the startup script in /etc/init.d/chkdev.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="97584"Run-time Symbol Tablelboot creates a run-time symbol table from the tables in master.d/rtsymtab and master.d/*.exports. The run-time symbol table contains kernel routines and global data that modules can link against. Only routines and globals that are always present in the kernel should be added to master.d/rtsymtab.If a module contains a routine or global that could be configured out of the kernel, add it to an xxx.exports file that will not be included in the kernel if the module is configured out. See master.d/idev.exports for an example.If a loadable module contains globals in its master.d file, you must create an xxx.exports file to include those globals so that they can be added to the run-time symbol table. For more information, see master.d/rtsymtab.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="14341"Debugging Loadable Kernel Modulessymmon supports debugging of loadable kernel modules. symmon commands that do a symbol table lookup, such as brk, lkup, lkaddr, hx, and nm, also search the symbol tables created for loadable modules. The ID="chap1115"msyms command can also be used to list the symbols for a particular loaded module:% msyms idUse the mlist command to list correctly loaded and registered modules:% mlistID="chap1116"For more information about using symmon, refer to IDREF="57559" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 10, "Driver Installation and Testing".The ml command contains a debug option that can be used to turn verbose error reporting on or off; it may also be used to disable the loading and registering of modules:% ml debug [-vns]-vthe verbose option turns verbose error reporting on.-nno load or register disallows the loading or registering of modules.-ssilence silences verbose error reporting and enables loading a registering of modules.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="81219"Load/Register FailuresIf a registered module fails to load, unregister and reload it with ml, ld, or lboot -L to get a more detailed error message about the failure. The kernel will fail to load or register a module for any of the following reasons:The major number specified either in the master file or by the ml command is already in use.The object file is not compiled with the correct options.The module is an "old style" driver, with either xxxdevflag set to D_OLD, or if no xxxdevflag exists in the driver.If the object file is corrupted, it may cause "invalid JMPADDR" errors from the relocation code in the kernel.The kernel did not resolve all of the module's symbols.All major numbers are in use.The switch table is full.Required entry points for the particular type of module are not found in the loaded object file.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="24008"Example 1The following example lists the steps necessary to build a kernel and load a character device driver, called dlkm, using lboot:Add d to the dlkm master file:COLUMNS="5"LEFT="0" WIDTH="45"*FlagLEFT="50" WIDTH="54"PrefixLEFT="110" WIDTH="45"SoftLEFT="160" WIDTH="45"#DevLEFT="210" WIDTH="126"DependenciesLEFT="0" WIDTH="45"cdLEFT="50" WIDTH="54"dlkmLEFT="110" WIDTH="45"38LEFT="160" WIDTH="45"2LEFT="210" WIDTH="126"Make sure that the cdevsw_extra kernel tuneable parameter allows for extra entries in the cdevsw table.

See the hinv(1M) man page.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="12969"Data Cache Write Back and InvalidationAll CPUs use the MIPS R2000, R3000, R4000, or R8000 (formerly known as "TFP") series processor chips (R4400 and R4600 are the same as the R4000 for all practical purposes). These chips use a data cache to maximize the efficiency of fetching of heavily used memory.ID="apenA1"The IP5, IP7, IP11, IP15, IP19, and IP21 multiprocessor CPUs have ID="apenA2"bus-watching cachesID="apenA3" that automatically invalidate the data cache when the system performs DMA (direct memory access) into physical memory. For these CPUs, no data cache write back or invalidation is required by software because these functions are performed by hardware.DMA operations are categorized as ID="apenA4"ID="apenA5"DMA readsID="apenA6" or ID="apenA7"DMA writesID="apenA8". DMA operations that transfer from memory to a device, and hence read memory, are DMA reads. DMA operations that transfer from a device to memory are DMA writes. Thus, you may want to think of DMA operations as being named from the point of view of what happens to memory. The single-processor CPUs based on the R2000 or R3000 employ a cache architecture known as a write through cacheID="apenA9"ID="apenA10"ID="apenA11". This means that all stores generated by the processor to a cached memory location go into the cache and into memory at the same time. Therefore, the data caches on these systems never contain data that is more recent than memory. However, after the system performs DMA to physical memory, the data lines in the processor's cache corresponding to this physical memory contain data that is ID="apenA12"stale with respect to memory. Therefore, a driver running on a single-processor CPU must explicitly invalidate the data cache before reading from the corresponding cached address, after the DMA completes.R4000s and R8000s employ a cache architecture known as a ID="apenA13"write back cacheID="apenA14". This means that stores generated by the processor go only into cache; they are written back from cache to memory only when a cache miss causes that cache line to be replaced. For this type of cache, the cache contains data that is newer than the corresponding memory locations. Memory is then ID="apenA15"stale with respect to the cache. Drivers that perform DMA reads from memory to device must specifically cause the cache to be written back to memory before the DMA starts. On IP19 and IP21 platforms, DMA pulls data from the processor caches, if necessary, thus providing ID="apenA16"coherent I/O. Recall the code examples that read kernel data in IDREF="61787" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 3, "Writing a VME Device Driver," and IDREF="83716" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Writing a SCSI Device Driver." Before reading the data, the driver code used the dki_dcache_inval() function to invalidate the appropriate data cache lines. When the data cache lines are invalidated, accessing the kernel data causes a cache miss and, thus, forces a read from physical memory. Therefore, to ensure driver portability, your driver must always use ID="apenA17"ID="apenA18"dki_dcache_inval() to invalidate the data cache. This is the case even though the ID="apenA19"ID="apenA20"ID="apenA21"dki_dcache_inval() functions defined for the IP5 and IP7 use stub functions that do not do any actual work, although they use ID="apenA22"dki_dcache_wb() before starting a DMA from memory to device. See IDREF="91239" TYPE="TABLE"Table A-2 for a summary of cache line sizes for various MIPS processors. If your driver uses the functions ID="apenA23"userdma() or ID="apenA24"physio() (physio calls userdma() internally), the data cache is automatically written back and invalidated for you no matter what system you are using. If your driver does not use these functions for a DMA write into cached memory, your driver must use ID="apenA25"dki_dcache_inval() to invalidate the data cache explicitly after the DMA completes. On systems with write through caches, and othe dki_dcache_inval() functions are stub functions that perform no actual work.
 Further, if your driver does a DMA read from memory to device, it must use dki_dcache_wbID="apenA26"() to write back the data cache explicitly before the DMA is started.FILE="" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"COLUMNS="7"LBL="A-2"Table A-2 ID="91239"Cache Line Sizes by Processor TypeLEFT="0" WIDTH="69"LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"LEFT="125" WIDTH="36"LEFT="170" WIDTH="58"LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"LEFT="280" WIDTH="36"LEFT="325" WIDTH="58"LEFT="0" WIDTH="69"Processor TypeLEFT="75" WIDTH="42"Size (D/I)LEFT="125" WIDTH="36"TypeLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"Line Size (D/I)LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"Size (D/I)LEFT="280" WIDTH="36"TypeLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"Line Size (D/I)LEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R3000 (IP12)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"32K/32KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"4/64LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"NoneLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"NoneLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"NoneLEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R3000 (IP7)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"64K/64KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"4/64LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"NoneLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"NoneLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"NoneLEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R4000PC (IP20)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"8K/8KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"NoneLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"NoneLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"NoneLEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R4000SC (IP17)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"8K/8KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"1-4 MBLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"128/128LEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R4400MP (IP19)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"16K/16KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"1-4 MBLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"128/128LEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R4600PC (IP22)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"16K/16KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"2LEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"NoneLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"NoneLEFT="325" WIDTH="58"NoneLEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R4600SC (IP22)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"16K/16KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"2LEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"512KLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"2LEFT="325" WIDTH="58"128LEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R8000 (IP21)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"16K/16KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"4 MBLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"4LEFT="325" WIDTH="58"512LEFT="0" WIDTH="69"R8000 (IP26)LEFT="75" WIDTH="42"16K/16KLEFT="125" WIDTH="36"DLEFT="170" WIDTH="58"32/32LEFT="235" WIDTH="39"2 MBLEFT="280" WIDTH="36"4LEFT="325" WIDTH="58"128Another consideration worth mentioning is that of buffer alignment for DMA. The R4000 processor implements a secondary cache line size of between 4 and 32 words (the secondary cache line size is dependent upon the CPU board implementation). Buffers used for DMA must be aligned on a byte boundary that is equal to the cache line size. To accomplish this, use the ID="apenA27"kmem_alloc() function with the KM_CACHEALIGN flag. This returns a buffer with the necessary alignment for the system. NoteThe R8000 has the same DMA alignment problems in general as the R4000. This is true for all systems with write back caches. Why is this alignment necessary? Suppose you have a variable, X, followed by a buffer you are going to use for DMA write. If you invalidate the buffer prior to the DMA write, but then reference the variable X, the resulting cache miss brings part of the buffer back into the cache. When the DMA write completes, the cache is stale with respect to memory. If, however, you invalidate the cache after the DMA write completes, you destroy the value of the variable X.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="99460"Flushing the Write BufferYou may, in some cases, want to call flushbusID="apenA28"() to ensure that any writes in the write buffer have actually been flushed to the system bus. This is sometimes necessary when a device requires delays between PIOs, particularly between a write and a read, since they might otherwise arrive at the device back-to-back.For example, you write to the device, delay, write to the device, delay. These writes may be buffered regardless of the delay and still be sent to the device in quick succession.LBL="" HELPID=""Registers and Register OptimizationVariables not declared volatile may be optimized to registers in the processor, since there are multiple processors. Multiple inconsistent copies of a variable may exist in registers if volatile is not declared.NoteUse the -O compiler flag to turn optimization on. The -g compiler flag for debugging disables optimization. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="17181"Reliable Multiprocessor SpinlocksThe multiprocessor CPUs implement test-and-set variables in hardware. These variables are known as ID="apenA29"spinlocks. Your code can use functions such as LOCK_ALLOC(D3) and LOCK(D3) to take advantage of these variables to protect a critical region of code or data on one processor from interference from other processors.ID="apenA30"ID="apenA31"All kernels for all Silicon Graphics CPUs support the spinlock functions (although these functions perform no actual work on single-processor systems). Therefore, a fully semaphored multiprocessor device driver can run unmodified on a single-processor system.NoteBecause IRIX kernels cannot, as a rule, be preempted, any driver that sits in a loop waiting for some condition to be satisfied may tie a processor up for as long as it wants. Real-time processes, such as audio, are very sensitive to such delays.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="27538"VME Slave AddressingRecall that these base addresses are passed to the driver through the device edtinit() function.

Silicon Graphics systems support both A24 and A32 VME master addressing. Although there are a few minor differences in the addressing modes supported (non-privileged versus supervisor), the main difference is that the 4D/100, 4D/200, 4D/300, 4D/400, and Crimson series systems support dynamic address mapping. This allows IP5, IP7, IP9, and IP17 CPUs to access all of physical memory for A24 addressing and allows scatter-gather for both A24 and A32 addressing.You can still write an IRIS-portable device driver if the dma_mapalloc() function does not return ≠1 and if the device driver can take advantage of the DMA mapping functions described in IDREF="83716" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Writing a SCSI Device Driver."

This made accessing the VME bus easy but was also limiting. Only a small amount of K2 space is available for use by VME, so very little of the VME address space was made available. Even worse, for dual VME-bus systems, the space previously available was now cut in half as it was shared between the two buses.The CHALLENGE series supports up to five VME buses. Since K2 space is a limited resource, and dividing up what is available by five would make the extra VME buses next to useless, a new approach was tried. The CHALLENGE series does not have a direct K2 address map into VME-bus space. Each VME bus adapter has the ability to map fifteen 8 MB windows of VME-bus space into K2 space. These windows can be slid around at will to give the illusion of a much larger address space.To access a VME space, a user must allocate a PIO map, which provides a translation between a kernel address and VME space. These mappings can be "FIXED" or "UNFIXED." As on POWER Series platforms, a FIXED mapping is a one-to-one mapping of a range of VME-bus space into the driver's address space. An UNFIXED window takes advantage of the sliding window ability on the CHALLENGE series, which supports both FIXED and UNFIXED mappings. In an UNFIXED map, VME-bus space cannot be accessed directly; instead, access is provided through special bcopy() routines used to move data between VME space and kernel buffers. While it is not always possible to get a FIXED mapping, an UNFIXED mapping is always available. The special bcopy() routines work for both FIXED and UNFIXED mappings. On POWER Series and earlier workstations, UNFIXED mappings are treated as FIXED mappings.The PIO mapping routines also have a general interface that allows them to be used for mapping in bus spaces other than VME.The support routines for PIO mapping are:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_mapallocLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Allocate a PIO map.LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_mapaddrLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Map bus space to a driver accessible address (FIXED maps only).LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_mapfreeLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Free a previously allocated PIO map.LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_badaddrLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Check to see whether a bus address is equipped.LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_wbadaddrLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Check to see whether a bus address is equipped.LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_bcopyinLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Copy data from bus space to kernel buffer.LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"pio_bcopyoutLEFT="90" WIDTH="287"Copy data from kernel buffer to bus space.These PIO maps are normally set up in the driver's drvedtinit() routine.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="62665"VME-bus Space Reserved for Customer DriversIDREF="29660" TYPE="TABLE"Table A-7 shows the VME-bus space reserved for customers.COLUMNS="3"LBL="A-7"Table A-7 ID="29660"VME-bus Space Reserved for Customer DriversLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"SpaceLEFT="70" WIDTH="103"VME ModifierLEFT="180" WIDTH="164"VME AddressLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A16LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x2DLEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x6000 ≠ 0x7FFFLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A16LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x29LEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x6000 ≠ 0x7FFFLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A24LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x3DLEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x800000 ≠ 0x9FFFFFLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A24LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x39LEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x000000 ≠ 0xFFFFFFLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A32LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x09LEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x1A000000 ≠ 0x1BFFFFFFLEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A32LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x09LEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x1E000000 ≠ 0x1FFFFFFF (IP5/7/9/17 Only)LEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A32LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x0DLEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x1E000000 ≠ 0x1BFFFFFF (IP5/7/9/17 Only)LEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A32LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x09LEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x20000000 ≠ 0x3FFFFFFF(IP19 and IP21 only)LEFT="0" WIDTH="64"A32LEFT="70" WIDTH="103"0x0DLEFT="180" WIDTH="164"0x20000000 ≠ 0x3FFFFFFF(IP19 and IP21 only)NoteFor information that may not have been available when this guide went to press, refer to the comments in the /var/sysgen/system/irix.sm file.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="71979"POWER Indigo2 and POWER CHALLENGE M DriversFor POWER Indigo2 or POWER CHALLENGE M processors, uncached (K1 segment) writes to main memory must be double-word (64-bit) writes, and they must be aligned on a double-word boundary. The reason for this has to do with the POWER Indigo2's hardware support for ECC-protected memory. Since the ECC calculation requires that data be written to main memory in 64-bit (8-byte) chunks, smaller (1-, 2-, and 4-byte) uncached writes to main memory tend to produce memory corruption. Cached accesses (both read and write), as well as uncached read operations do not cause problems; neither do accesses that are not to main memory, such as device register reads and writes.Any device driver that performs uncached writes to main memory must always do writes in 8-byte quantities. Access to device registers does not fall under this restriction.
 If the driver needs to write a smaller piece of memory, then it must do the write as a read-modify-write operation of an 8-byte piece of memory. For example, a driver with code like the following (assuming that the structure is being accessed uncached), would corrupt memory:struct foo_s {
    char    b0;
    char    b1;
    char    b2;
    char    b3;
    char    b4;
    char    b5;
    char    b6;
    char    b7;
} bar1;

driver_write_bar1_b3 ()
{
    bar1.b3 = 5;
}Instead, it would have to be modified to perform a read-modify-write operation on the whole double-word containing b3, as in the following example (on a big-endian system):struct foo_s {
    union {
        __uint64    dw;    /* A 64-bit quantity */
        struct {
            char    b0;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b1;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b2;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b3;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b4;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b5;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b6;    /* READ ONLY */
            char    b7;    /* READ ONLY */
        } byte;
    } dw0;
} bar1;

driver_write_bar1_b3 ()
{
    bar1.dw0.dw = (bar1.dw0.dw & ~(0xff<<32)) | (5<<32);
}If at all possible, use cached accesses to memory, along with cache coherency operations where necessary, instead of uncached operations. Cache coherency operations are necessary only for data shared by the CPU and a device that needs to perform DMA. See IDREF="12969" TYPE="TITLE""Data Cache Write Back and Invalidation" for more information on use of cache coherency operations.LBL="" HELPID=""Sharing Data Between CPU and Peripheral DevicesTo avoid memory contamination, the CPU and any other device capable of DMA must not both be allowed to write data to separate parts of a double-word in memory. Since CPU accesses to smaller portions of a double-word are performed as read-modify-write operations, they are not atomic, and could be interleaved with data written by a device between the CPU read operation and the CPU write operation. Make sure that data written by a device does not fall within the same double-word as data written by the CPU.LBL="" HELPID=""Using mmap()If you have a driver that allows a process to access main memory uncached through the mmap() call, that process must not write the memory using operations that write less than 8 bytes at a time. Again, this restriction does not apply to accesses to device registers, or to accesses to cached memory.LBL="B"ID="32705"SCSI Controller Error Messages This appendix lists many common error messages.

disconnected on non-word

requires word (32-bit) alignment at start 
of any DMA (low two bits must be 0 in 
the address). If not, one of the following 
two messages is issued, depending on 
whether this is the start of a command or 
a data phase continued on a reselection. 
The latter case can occur if a device 
disconnects and reselects, even if it 
doesn't go to data phase, if the DMA 
count remaining is non-zero. This is 
because it is too difficult to handle the 
case where the device disconnects and 
then reselects just to go to status phase. 
Such devices are inefficient at best, and, 
fortunately, are rare. If you must use 
such a device, your only option is to 
disable SCSI disconnects altogether (in 
master.d/wd93).LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"ID=%d LUN=%d not found in

This appendix contains the following sections:IDREF="89492" TYPE="TITLE""Introduction"IDREF="65410" TYPE="TITLE""IRIX 4.x to 5.x Migration"IDREF="49002" TYPE="TITLE""IRIX 5.2 to 5.3 Migration"IDREF="88025" TYPE="TITLE""Migration to IRIX 6.0"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="89492"IntroductionLBL="" HELPID=""Intended Audience and PrerequisitesThis appendix is intended to aid in the planning of device driver migration from previous versions of IRIX to the IRIX 5.3 and IRIX 6.0 environments. It assumes you are familiar with the existing material on developing IRIX device drivers.LBL="" HELPID=""BackgroundBefore you upgrade a perfectly good device driver that runs on an older version of IRIX, compute the time it will take to rewrite your driver to run under the new operating systems against the actual performance improvement you hope to achieve. In some cases, it may be to your advantage to continue using an older driver by recompiling its source code under the new operating system. For those cases where it is to your advantage to modify an existing driver, the following notes are provided.LBL="" HELPID=""IRIX 5.xIRIX 5.x is a binary-compatible upgrade to IRIX 4.0.x at the user program level. However, due to the extensive internal changes to the IRIX kernel, device drivers and other kernel components, such as STREAMS modules and file systems, must be revised and recompiled for the IRIX 5.x environment. It is possible that changes to IRIX 5.3 will become effective after the publication of this manual.Most of the changes in the IRIX kernel result from supporting the SVR4 interfaces for both applications programs and for certain kernel internal interfaces. The IRIX 5.x kernel interfaces are:SVR4 Device Driver Interface/Driver Kernel Interface (SVR4 DDI/DKI) described in theIDREF="74847" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="74847"IRIX Device Driver Reference Pages. The IRIX 5.x operating system implementation uses a multiprocessor version of DDI/DKI developed for Silicon Graphics platforms.SVR4 STREAMS Interface, which is documented in the UNIXÆ System V Release 4 STREAMS Programming Guide.IRIX 5.x Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) (relevant to STREAMS protocol stacks and to network drivers). This standard interface, defined by IEEE Standard 802.3, permits flexible integration protocol stacks and their "peaceful coexistence" with the TCP/IP stack. Protocol stacks register themselves with DLPI, as do the network drivers present in the system. The new protocol stack is thus isolated from the specific network hardware support present in the system. LBL="" HELPID=""IRIX 6.0IRIX 6.0 is the 64-bit operating system for all Silicon Graphics systems that use MIPS R8000 series microprocessors. Because the IRIX 6.0 kernel is itself a 64-bit object, device drivers must be ported to the 64-bit operating system.LBL="" HELPID=""Migration OverviewThe migration of drivers from an IRIX 4.0.5 environment to an IRIX 5.x environment is straightforward. The migration of several typical IRIX drivers required changes to less than 10% of the source lines. Most of these changes were in declarations. Naturally, extremely complex drivers that reached into the IRIX kernel to access services not typically employed in device drivers will have to change, as many of these interfaces have been replaced or altered. In any case, you are responsible for getting your device drivers to work across operating system and platform upgrades.The changes to drivers fall in a number of broad categories:Changes in drivers that are a result of changes in the SVR4 API (Application Programmatic Interface) as compared to the SVR3 API.Changes to the declaration of the DKI interface, such as additional arguments to the driver calling interfaces and, in some cases, different procedure typing (mostly to make them void).Changes to use the DDI interface instead of the now obsolete IRIX 4.0.x interfaces for kernel service invocation. This may include changes that result from the changes in the semantics of the DDI. There are also some SGI interfaces defined for services omitted by DDI, such as cache flushing and address map setup.Changes to accommodate the architecture of the CHALLENGE/Onyx family, especially in the richness of its bus structure.Changes to accommodate the architecture of the Indigo2, notably the EISA bus. Since this is the first Silicon Graphics system to use this bus, there are no migration issues.Changes in network device drivers and protocol stacks to make use of the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI). See the dlpi(7) man page.Changes to take advantage of the IRIX 5.x dynamically loadable kernel module support. This permits device drivers to be loaded into a running system without rebooting. This is discussed in the ID="apenC1"mload(4) man pages.Changes to the SCSI driver interface to unify all supported SCSI controllers. See IDREF="83716" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Writing a SCSI Device Driver," for details.LBL="" HELPID=""IID="65410"RIX 4.x to 5.x MigrationThis section serves as a preliminary guide to planning the migration of device drivers from the IRIX 4.0.x environment to IRIX 5.x. The discussion below assumes that you already have the device driver working in IRIX 4.0.x, and need only to migrate it to IRIX 5.x.LBL="" HELPID=""SVR4 API ChangesThe SVR4 API changes the size of a number of system structures to accommodate the changes in Expanded Fundamental Types. (Briefly, a number of fields, such as the user and group ID and device numbers are changed from 16 to 32 bits.) For driver work, the most important impact of these API changes is in the access to the major and minor numbers. The device number is now a 32-bit quantity, by changing the underlying type of the typedef dev_t. Access to the major and minor numbers can no longer be done with the 8-bit shift-and-mask technique common in prior versions of UNIX. (This is especially true as the split of the 32 bits between major and minor is a "hidden" parameter.) DDI defines a series of functions/macros to provide access to the major and minor numbers.LBL="" HELPID=""STREAMS ChangesFor STREAMS, there are the standard SVR3 (4.x) to SVR4 (5.x) STREAMS changes, most notably in the arguments to the driver's open routine. For further details, please refer to STREAMS Modules and Drivers, UNIX SVR4.2. UNIX Press, 1992.LBL="" HELPID=""DDI ChangesTheIDREF="74847" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="74847"IRIX Device Driver Reference Pages documents the routines that DDI supports. Generally, these have analogs to routines supported in prior versions of IRIX, but the syntax and semantics may differ, and the driver may need to have minor logic updates to accommodate these changes. In some drivers, the changes to support DDI simplify the driver by invoking common service interfaces in DDI instead of performing the work in the driver.As it stands, DDI is insufficient to write a driver using only the routines in DDI. The lacks are in areas specific to a particular architecture or family, such as cache flushing and device register addressability in complex bus architectures. SGI has defined a number of additional service interfaces to support these needs.LBL="" HELPID=""DKI ChangesThe changes from the new DKI affect the driver routines called by the rest of the IRIX kernel, both the *devsw entry points and the interrupt handlers. The details of these interfaces are described in theIDREF="74847" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="74847"IRIX Device Driver Reference Pages . The primary changes are:Device numbers are passed as a dev_t rather than as an int in prior IRIX versions. As mentioned elsewhere, the DDI contains new functions to access the major and minor numbers. Note that open takes a dev_t *, while read and write take a dev_t (no indirection).Many of the entry points (open, close, read, write) take a new argument that is an opaque credentials structure. (It is opaque in the sense that the device driver never examines the internal makeup of the structure.) This is used to call the DDI drv_priv() routine, which takes the place of checking u.u_uid == 0. This permits different models of privileges to be used, for example, in a trusted system. The read and write routines take a uio_t *, a pointer to a structure that defines the addresses and lengths of the data in the user space. (The IDREF="74847" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="74847"IRIX Device Driver Reference Pages describe this structure. It is defined in /usr/include/sys/uio.h.) Previously, this information was computed in the driver from the u vector. The driver typically passes this structure to a DMA setup routine such as the DDI uiophysio() or the Silicon Graphics enhancement, biophysio(), which is nearly identical to iophysio(), except that it takes a block number instead of a file offset).Generally, drivers can no longer access the u vector directly. DDI defines access routines for fields in the u vector. Direct access to the u vector tends to make a driver more dependent on specific aspects of the system than is desirable. This also extends to access u.u_error. DKI expect to return the error value (0 indicates no error), and are not supposed to set u.u_error.Interrupt routines are now of type void.LBL="" HELPID=""AddressabilityThe driver needs to arrange for addressability of the device registers in the CHALLENGE/Onyx family and, in the interest of having common code for VME drivers between the POWER Series‘ and these systems, drivers must set up the appropriate mappings. This is done by the new pio_map() routines, which have similar calling interfaces to the dma_map() routines from prior versions.LBL="" HELPID=""CHALLENGE/Onyx Family SupportThe CHALLENGE/Onyx family architecture has added new features and restrictions on the drivers, configuration, and other tools that could not be dealt with by the existing software framework. Supporting these systems with the common source used for all Silicon Graphics products necessitated changes in the way kernels are configured and support in for the new hardware features.Some of the CHALLENGE series architecture differences include:Multiple types of bus support (such as VME, GIO, SCSI).VME buses are not automatically mapped into known K2 segment addresses. VME-bus controllers cannot access physical memory directly. Only a portion of the VME-bus A32 space can be mapped into the kernel at any one time.These differences cause the following software changes:The need for a general mechanism for probing for devices on multiple and different types of buses caused changes to the VECTOR line to specify which type of bus, which bus of that type, which address space on that particular bus, which address on that bus, and so on. Since there are no automatic K2 addresses, the addresses are abstracted and more meaningful than they were in the past. Different buses require different types of information, as well. VME has interrupts specifying both a vector and IPL, whereas EISA does not. So, a bus-specific portion was added to the edt structure. This caused the need for new VECTOR line probing specifications, as well.Since there are no known K2 addresses that correspond to VME-bus locations, user-level VME drivers can no longer be performed through /dev/mmem, but instead, they now have their own /dev/vme device interface. This also affects kernel drivers. Kernel drivers must map in the address space of their controllers before they can access them. This is done with special pio_mapping routines, similar to existing DMA mapping routines. This is further complicated by the fact that, for VME A32 space, pio_mapping registers are a limited resource. Only 13*8 MB can be mapped into the kernel at any one time; so 12 of these registers can be locked down and the thirteenth used as a floater to be shared by whoever needs it, from drivers to lboot.NoteA32 pio_mappings start and end on 8 MB boundaries. The address you map plus the length of the mapping must not cross an 8 MB boundary.Since VME-bus controllers cannot access physical memory directly, you can no longer pass the controller a K0 address and expect it to work. EVERYTHING has to be DMA mapped. For example, in the past, IOPB addresses were normally converted to K0 addresses and passed to the controller. Now the IOPBs must be DMA mapped.Some new functionality has been added to the VME driver interface. Since most VME boards can have their IRQ vector and ipl programmed through software, it is now possible to allocate VME vectors dynamically, so they need not be specified on the VECTOR line. This frees you from worrying about finding one that is not already in use. Simply call vme_ivec_alloc() to allocate a free vector, then call vme_ivec_set() to register your interrupt routine.The driver interface now uses the SVR4 MP DDI/DKI interface except for the Silicon Graphics-specific routines, such as pio_map() and dma_map(). For example, entry points such as open, close, read, and write all have slightly different arguments and, in some cases, different procedure types, in 5.x than they had in earlier versions.The DDI/DKI drvrflags variable, not the flag in the master.d file, is used for the driver to indicate that it is MP-safe.LBL="" HELPID=""Kernel Configuration IssuesThe highly flexible architecture of the CHALLENGE family requires extensions to the descriptions of devices in the IRIX kernel configuration process, specifically to the VECTOR lines in the system configuration files. The new VECTOR line for VME would look like the following:VECTOR: bustype=VME module=jag ipl=1 ctlr=0 adapter=0 iospace=(A16S, 0, 0x800) probe_space=(A16S, 0, 1)NoteThe VECTOR line is still all one line. It is broken here to fit on the page.New fields are bustype, which in this case is VME. The ctlr field takes the place of unit in 4.0.x. The adapter field specifies which VME bus. (CHALLENGE systems can be configured to have multiple VME buses). The iospace triple is used to pass in the address of the controller. The first argument defines the address space. Valid values are A16S, A16NP, A24S, A24NP, A32S, A32NP, A64S, A64NP.    The second argument is the address with the specified address space. The third argument is the length of the mapping. The probe_space line performs a badaddr like function (that is, it tries to read the specified address and catch any errors) on the specified address. In this case, the arguments are the address space, address within that space, and the size of the read.There is also an exprobe_space extended probe space defined as follows: exprobe_space=(r,A16S,0,2,0xfdd1,0xffff)The difference between it and the 4.0.x version of exprobe is in the specification of the address to test.Notice that no vector is specified. The old vector= primitive is still supported for boards that are jumpered. Generally, drivers would use the vme_ivec_alloc() and vme_ivec_set() routines to allocate and set the vector.LBL="" HELPID=""Equipped Device Table (EDT) ChangesThe form of the structures for the Equipped Device Table (EDT) have changed for the same reasons as the VECTOR line in the configuration (the VECTOR information is used as initialization values for the EDT entries).The following information is from /usr/include/sys/edt.h:#define NBASE 3
typedef unsigned long iopaddr_t;
typedef struct iospace {
   unchar    ios_type;     /* io space type on the adapter */
   iopaddr_t ios_iopaddr;  /* io space base address */
   ulong     ios_size;
   caddr_t   ios_vaddr;    /* kernel virtual address */
} iospace_t;

typedef struct edt {
   uint_t    e_bus_type;   /* vme, scsi, eisa... */
   unchar    v_cpuintr;    /* cpu to send intr to */
   unchar    v_setcpuintr; /* cpu field is valid */
   uint_t    e_adap;       /* adapter */
   uint_t    e_ctlr;       /* controller identifier */
   void*     e_bus_info;   /* bus-dependent info */
   int       (*e_init)();  /* device init/run-time probe */
   iospace_t e_space[NBASE];
} edt_t;

#define    e_iobase e_space[0].ios_iopaddr
#define    e_iobase2 e_space[1].ios_iopaddr
#define    e_iobase3 e_space[2].ios_iopaddr

The e_bus_info field points to the following structure:

typedef struct vme_intrs {
   int (*v_vintr)();        /* interrupt routine */
   unsigned    char v_vec;  /* vme vector */
   unsigned    char v_brl;  /* interrupt priority level */
   unsigned    char v_unit; /* software identifier */
} vme_intrs_t;
The following fragment illustrates an edtinit routine using the new structures and the new pio_* routines.mydrvredtinit(struct edt *e)
{
   piomap_t *piomap;
   vme_intrs_t *intrs = e->e_bus_info;
[...]
 piomap = pio_mapalloc(e->e_bus_type, e->e_adap, 
   &e->e_space[0], PIOMAP_FIXED, "mydrvr");

 if (piomap == 0) {
      /* This could fail because the adapter isn't valid

      printf("mydrvr not installed\n");
      return;
   }

 e->e_base = pio_mapaddr(piomap, e->e_iobase);

While likely to be correct, it is based on extracted diff listings of actual drivers migrating between 5.2 and 5.3, so there may be errors or omissions. Please use the information with caution.All IRIX 5.2 kernel components, including drivers and STREAMS modules, require some amount of work to migrate to IRIX 5.3. In the simplest cases, no source changes are required, but changes in the size of certain kernel structures make it necessary to recompile the same source in a 5.3 build environment.In certain device drivers, three types of changes from the IRIX 5.2 kernel to the IRIX 5.3 kernel require some work: Support for a multi-threaded version of TCP/IP. This requires change in network drivers to use the new blocking scheme instead of the older splnet() blocking scheme. Incorporation of hooks for Trusted IRIX/B to allow the use of a least privilege model. The changes in drivers are to replace any calls to suser() or explicit checks of u.u_uid == 0 with a corresponding call to one of the capability check routines. mbuf management scheme. The mbuf pool is now initialized early in the system life, so drivers do not need to call mbinit().LBL="" HELPID=""Standard Device DriversThe simplest migration is for standard (non-network and non-STREAMS) device drivers.

For details on drivers for POWER Indigo2 or POWER CHALLENGE M, see IDREF="71979" TYPE="TITLE""POWER Indigo2 and POWER CHALLENGE M Drivers" in Appendix A.LBL="" HELPID=""Virtual Page SizeThe virtual page size for 64-bit kernels is currently 16 KB, while it is 4 KB for 32-bit systems. However, various I/O hardware items (such as DMA map registers on CHALLENGE/Onyx platforms) still deal with 4 KB pages for I/O, requiring that the driver use a different set of constants or procedures when dealing with I/O pages.Most of the following new I/O-related items already exist without the IO_ prefix and refer to virtual memory page size rather than I/O page size.LBL="" HELPID=""ConstantsIO_NBPPID="apenC3"number of bytes in an I/O pageIO_PNUMSHFTID="apenC4"number of bits to shift I/O address to page numberIO_POFFMASKID="apenC5"mask for offset into I/O pageLBL="" HELPID=""Macrosio_pnum(x)ID="apenC6"ID="apenC7"I/O page number from addressio_poff(x)ID="apenC8"ID="apenC9"I/O page offset from addressio_numpages(addr, len)ID="apenC10"ID="apenC11"number of I/O pages to span address range starting at addr for len bytesio_ctob(x)ID="apenC12"ID="apenC13"convert I/O pages to bytes io_btoc(x)ID="apenC14"ID="apenC15"convert byte count to number of pages (rounded up)io_btoct(x)ID="apenC16"ID="apenC17"convert byte count to number of pages (rounded down)To convert an existing driver, a good starting point would be to examine all uses of NBPP, PNUMSHFT, POFFMASK, pnum, poff, ctob, btoc, and btoct and consider:whether they refer to virtual memory pages and should be left aloneorwhether they refer to I/O pages and need to be converted.LBL="" HELPID=""ioctl SupportIn addition to the usual 64-bit conversion worries (longs and pointers becoming 64-bits, ints remaining 32-bits), drivers may need to support ioctls from user programs. Since user programs may be 32-bit or 64-bit, data items from those programs may need to be converted into the appropriate internal form for the driver. (The driver needs to know whether a pointer or a long from a user program should be treated as a 32-bit quantity or a 64-bit quantity.) To ease the driver conversion, a new system intrinsic that informs the driver of the size of various types for the currently executing user has been supplied. See the IDREF="ioctl(D2)" BOOK="DevDriver_RP" FILE="" HDG="ioctl(D2)"ioctl(D2)

userabi(__userabi_t *currentabi)LBL="" HELPID=""PointersPointers in memory buffers need to be double-word aligned to avoid address errors when the pointers are loaded. Both pointers and longs must be aligned on 8-byte boundaries; neither should be cast to int because the int structure is only 32-bits wide.LBL="" HELPID=""Hardware Data CopyingWhen copying data to or from a hardware device, drivers should use the functions hwcpin and hwcpout rather than bcopy. The reason is that the kernel bcopy routine is optimized for memory access and may use double-word loads and stores, which may not be supported by the hardware device. The routines hwcpin and hwcpout perform only word (or byte and half-word) operations.ID="80107"GlossaryABIApplication Binary Interface.adjmsgTrim bytes from a message.allocbAllocate a message block.ASSERTProgram verification macro.badaddrCheck for bus error when reading an address.bcanputTest for flow control in a specified priority band.bcopyCopy data between address locations in the kernel.big-endianThe default for a byte order. biodoneRelease buffer after block I/O and wakeup processes.bioerrorManipulate error field within a buffer header.biowaitSuspend processes pending completion of block I/O.block driverA device driver, such as for magnetic tape or disk drives, that transfers data in blocks through the buf structure.bp_mapinAllocate virtual address space for buffer page list.bp_mapoutDeallocate virtual address space for buffer page list.brelseReturn a buffer to the system's free list.btodConvert from bytes to disk sectors.btopConvert size in bytes to size in pages (rounded down).bptophysGet physical address of buffer data.btoprReturn number of memory pages contained in the specified number of bytes, rounded up.buf Block I/O data transfer structure, the basic data structure for block I/O transfers.bufcallCall a function when a buffer becomes available.bus-watching cacheWhen an IP5, IP7, or IP19 system performs a DMA write into physical memory, the bus-watching cache automatically invalidates the data cache.
