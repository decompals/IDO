It documents previous releases of the Silicon Graphics® C compilers as well as the ANSI C compiler. The Silicon Graphics compiler system supports two modes of compilation: a 32-bit mode and a 64-bit mode.

For example:{ expressionopt }This notation is the standard BNF notation.LBL="2"ID="47127"An Overview of ANSI CThis chapter covers the following topics:IDREF="58298" TYPE="TITLE""What Is ANSI C?" briefly discusses the scope of the new standard.IDREF="68958" TYPE="TITLE""Helpful Programming Hints" lists some programming practices to avoid and some to use.IDREF="37032" TYPE="TITLE""Areas of Major Change" lists the major changes to C made by the ANSI standard.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="58298"What Is ANSI C?The ANSI standard on the programming language C is designed to promote the portability of C programs among a variety of data-processing systems. To accomplish this, the standard covers three major areas: the environment in which the program compiles and executes, the semantics and syntax of the language, and the content and semantics of a set of library routines and header files. ID="chap021"Strictly conforming programs are programs that: use only those features of the language defined in the standarddo not produce output dependent on any ill-defined behaviordo not exceed any minimum limit.Ill-defined behavior includes implementation-defined, undefined, and unspecified behavior. The term refers to areas that the standard does not specify. This ANSI C environment is designed to be, in the words of the standard, a conforming hosted implementation, which is guaranteed to accept any strictly conforming program. Extensions are allowed, as long as the behavior of strictly conforming programs is not altered.Besides knowing which features of the language and library you may rely on when writing portable programs, you must be able to avoid naming conflicts with support routines used for the implementation of the library. To avoid such naming conflicts, ANSI divides the space of available names into a set reserved for the user and a set reserved for the implementation. Any name that does not begin with an underscore and is neither a keyword in the language nor reserved for the ANSI library, is in the user's namespace. (This rule is given for simplicity. The space of names reserved for the user is actually somewhat larger than this.) ID="chap022"ID="chap023"Strictly conforming programs may not define any names unless they are in the user's namespace. New keywords as well as those names reserved for the ANSI library are discussed in IDREF="22110" TYPE="TITLE""Standard Headers". LBL="" HELPID=""ID="95059"Compiling ANSI ProgramsTo provide the portable clean environment dictated by ANSI while retaining the many extensions available to Silicon Graphics users, two modes of compilation are provided for ANSI programs. Each of these modes invokes the ANSI compiler and is selected by a switch to cc(1): ID="chap024"­ansienforces a pure ANSI environment, eliminating Silicon Graphics extensions. The ANSI symbol indicating a pure environment (__STDC__) is defined to be 1 for the preprocessor. Use this mode when compiling strictly conforming programs, as it guarantees purity of the ANSI namespace. ­xansiadds Silicon Graphics extensions to the environment. This mode is the default. The ANSI preprocessor symbol (__STDC__) is defined to be 1. The symbol to include extensions from standard headers (__EXTENSIONS__) is also defined, as is the symbol to inline certain library routines that are directly supported by the hardware (__INLINE_INTRINSICS.) Note that when these library routines are made to be intrinsic, they may no longer be strictly ANSI conforming (e.g., errno may not be set correctly).Some key facts to keep in mind when you use ANSI C are listed below: Use only­lc and/or ­lm to specify the C and/or math libraries. These switches ensure the incorporation of the ANSI version of these libraries.ID="chap028"ID="chap029"ID="chap0210"The default compilation mode is shared and the libraries are shared. ID="chap0211"ID="chap0212"ID="chap0213"Use the switch ­fullwarn to receive additional diagnostic warnings that are suppressed by default. Silicon Graphics recommends using this option with the ­woff option to remove selected warnings during software development.Use the switch ­wlint (­32 mode only) to get lint-like warnings about the compiled source. This option provides lint-like warnings for ANSI and ­cckr modes and can be used together with the other ID="chap0215"cc(1) options and switches. 
If you want to compile code using traditional C (that is, non-ANSI), use the switch ­cckr. The dialect of C invoked by ­cckr is referred to interchangeably as ­cckr, "the previous version of Silicon Graphics C," and "traditional C" in the remainder of this document.You can find complete information concerning ANSI and non-ANSI compilation modes in the online manual page for cc(1).LBL="" HELPID=""ID="68958"Helpful Programming HintsAlthough the ANSI Standard has added only a few new features to the C language, it has tightened the semantics of many areas. In some cases, constructs were removed that were ambiguous, no longer used, or obvious hacks. The next two sections give two lists of programming practices. The first section recommends practices that you can use to ease your transition to this new environment. The second section below lists common C coding practices that cause problems when you use ANSI C. ID="chap0218"ID="chap0219"LBL="" HELPID=""Recommended PracticesFollow these recommendations as you code:Always use the appropriate header file when declaring standard external functions. Avoid embedding the declaration in your code. Thus you avoid inconsistent declarations for the same function. ID="chap0220"ID="chap0221"ID="chap0222"Always use function prototypes, and write your function prologues in function prototype form. Use the offsetof() macro to derive structure member offsets. The offsetof() macro is in <stddef.h>. ID="chap0223"Always use casts when converting. Be strict with your use of qualified objects, such as with ID="chap0224"volatile and const. Assign the addresses of these objects only to pointers that are so qualified. Return a value from all return points of all non-ID="chap0225"void functions. Use only structure designators of the appropriate type as the structure designator in . and -> expressions (that is, ensure that the right side is a member of the structure on the left side). Always specify the types of integer bitfields as ID="chap0226"signed or unsigned. LBL="" HELPID=""Practices to AvoidAvoid these dangerous practices:Never mix prototyped and nonprototyped declarations of the same function.Never call a function before it has been declared. This may lead to an incompatible implicit declaration for the function. In particular, this is unlikely to work for prototyped functions that take a variable number of arguments.Never rely on the order in which arguments are evaluated. For example, what is the result of the code fragment foo(a++,a,name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188)?ID="chap0227"ID="chap0228"ID="chap0229"Avoid using expressions with side effects as arguments to a function ID="chap0230"Avoid two side effects to the same data location between two successive sequence points (for example, x=++x;).Avoid declaring functions in a local context, especially if they have prototypes. Never access parameters that are not specified in the argument list unless using the stdarg facilities. Use the stdarg facilities only on a function with an unbounded argument list (that is, an argument list terminated with name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188). ID="chap0231"Never cast a pointer type to anything other than another pointer type or an integral type of the same size (unsigned long), and vice versa. Use a union type to access the bit-pattern of a pointer as a nonintegral and nonpointer type (that is, as an array of chars).Don't hack preprocessor tokens (for example, ID="chap0232"FOO/**/BAR). Never modify a string literal. ID="chap0233"Don't rely on search rules to locate include files that you specify with quotes. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="37032"Areas of Major ChangeMajor changes to C made by the ANSI standard include:Some preprocessor changes are noteworthy. The changes are in practices that, although questionable, are not uncommon. Rules for disambiguating names have been more clearly defined. Most of these changes allow greater freedom to use the same name in different contexts. ID="chap0234"ID="chap0235"Types have undergone some significant changes in the areas of promotions and more strictly enforced compatibility rules. In addition, the compiler is more strict about mixing qualified and unqualified types and their pointers.    ID="chap0236"ID="chap0237"ID="chap0238"ID="chap0239"ID="chap0240"ID="chap0241"ID="chap0242"Function prototypes are more completely observed. Many warnings concerning prototypes in traditional C are now errors under ANSI.A few external names have been changed for conformance. LBL="3"ID="90984"C Language ChangesThis chapter describes changes to the C language including:IDREF="16672" TYPE="TITLE""Preprocessor Changes" discusses two changes in the way the preprocessor handles string literals and tokens.IDREF="36460" TYPE="TITLE""Changes in Disambiguating Identifiers" covers the four characteristics ANSI C uses to distinguish identifiers.IDREF="30681" TYPE="TITLE""Types and Type Compatibility" describes ANSI C changes to type promotions and type compatibility.IDREF="93558" TYPE="TITLE""Function Prototypes" explains how ANSI C handles function prototyping.IDREF="26015" TYPE="TITLE""External Name Changes" discusses the changes in function, linker-defined, and data area names.IDREF="22110" TYPE="TITLE""Standard Headers" lists standard header files.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="16672"Preprocessor ChangesWhen compiling in an ANSI C mode (which is the default unless you specify ­cckr), ANSI-standard C preprocessing is used. The preprocessor is built into the C front end and is functionally unchanged from the version appearing on IRIXÔ Release 3.10. The 3.10 version of the compiler had no built-in preprocessor and used two standalone preprocessors for ID="chap031"­cckr (cpp(1)) and ANSI C (acpp(5)) preprocessing respectively. If you compile using the ­32 option, you can activate acpp or cpp instead of the built-in preprocessor by using the ­oldcpp option, and acpp in ­cckr mode by using the ­acpp option. Silicon Graphics recommends that you always use the built-in preprocessor, rather than cpp or acpp, since these standalone preprocessors may not be supported in future releases of the compilers.acpp is a public domain preprocessor and its source is included in /usr/src/gnu/acpp. Traditionally, the C preprocessor performed two functions that are now illegal under ANSI C. These functions are the substitution of macro arguments within string literals and the concatenation of tokens after removing a null comment sequence.LBL="" HELPID=""Replacement of Macro Arguments in StringsSuppose you define two macros ID="chap032"IN and PLANT as shown in this example:#define IN(x)    `x'
#define PLANT(y) "placing y in a string"Later, you invoke them as follows:IN(hi)
PLANT(foo) Compiling with ­cckr makes these substitutions:ID="chap033"`hi'
"placing foo in a string"However, since ANSI C considers a string literal to be an atomic unit, the expected substitution doesn't occur. So, ANSI C adopted an explicit preprocessor sequence to accomplish the substitution.In ANSI C, adjacent string literals are concatenated. ThusID="chap034""abc" "def"becomes "abcdef"A mechanism for quoting a macro argument was adopted that relies on this. When a macro definition contains one of its formal arguments preceded by a single #, the substituted argument value is quoted in the output. The simplest example of this is as follows:#define STRING_LITERAL(a)   # a For example, the above code is invoked as:STRING_LITERAL(foo) This code yields: "foo"In conjunction with the rule of concatenation of adjacent string literals, the following macros can be defined: #define ARE(a,c) # a " are " # c Then ARE(trucks,big) yields "trucks" " are " "big" or "trucks are big" when concatenated. Blanks prepended and appended to the argument value are removed. If the value has more than one word, each pair of words in the result is separated by a single blank. Thus, the macro ARE above could be invoked as the following:ARE( fat   cows,big ) ARE(fat cows, big) Each of the above yields (after concatenation): "fat cows are big"Be sure to avoid enclosing your macro arguments in quotes, since these quotes are placed in the output string. For example,ARE ("fat cows", "big")This code becomes:"\"fat cows\" are \"big\""No obvious facility exists to enclose macro arguments with single quotes.LBL="" HELPID=""Token ConcatenationWhen compiling ­cckr, the value of macro arguments can be concatenated by enteringID="chap035"#define glue(a,b)  a/**/b glue(FOO,BAR) The result yields ID="chap036"FOOBAR. This concatenation does not occur under ANSI C, since null comments are replaced by a blank. However, similar behavior can be obtained by using the ID="chap037"## operator in ­ansi and ­xansi mode. ## instructs the precompiler to concatenate the value of a macro argument with the adjacent token. Thus #define glue_left(a) GLUED ## a 
#define glue_right(a) a ## GLUED 
#define glue(a,b) a ## b 
glue_left(LEFT) 
glue_right(RIGHT) 
glue(LEFT,RIGHT) yields GLUEDLEFT
RIGHTGLUED
LEFTRIGHT Furthermore, the resulting token is a candidate for further replacement. Note what happens in this example:#define HELLO "hello"
#define glue(a,b) a ## b 
glue(HEL,LO) The above example yields the following:"hello"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="36460"Changes in Disambiguating Identifiers Under ANSI C, an identifier has four disambiguating characteristics: its ID="chap038"scope, linkage, namespace, and storageduration. Each of these characteristics was used in traditional C, either implicitly or explicitly. Except in the case of storage duration, which is either static or automatic, the definitions of these characteristics chosen by the standard differ in certain ways from those you may be accustomed to, as detailed below. For a discussion of the same material with a different focus, see IDREF="39439" TYPE="TITLE""Disambiguating Names".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="45081"Scoping DifferencesANSI C recognizes four scopes of identifiers: the familiar file and block scopes and the new function and function prototype scopes.ID="chap039"ID="chap0310"Function scope includes only labels. As in traditional C, labels are valid until the end of the current function. Block scope rules differ from traditional C in one significant instance: the outermost block of a function and the block that contains the function arguments are the same under ANSI C. For example:int f(x)
int x;
{
   int x;
   x = 1; 
} ANSI C complains of a redeclaration of x, whereas traditional C quietly hides the argument x with the local variable x, as they were in distinct scopes. Function prototype scope is a new scope in ANSI C. If an identifier appears within the list of parameter declarations in a function prototype that is not part of a function definition, it has function prototype scope, which terminates at the end of the prototype. This allows any dummy parameter names appearing in a function prototype to disappear at the end of the prototype. Consider the following example:ID="chap0311"ID="chap0312"char * getenv (const char * name);int name;The int variable name does not conflict with the parameter name since the parameter went out of scope at the end of the prototype. However, the prototype is still in scope.Identifiers appearing outside of any block, function, or function prototype have file scope. One last discrepancy in scoping rules between ANSI and traditional C concerns the scope of the function foo() in the example below:ID="chap0313"float f;
func0() {
   extern float foo() ;
   f = foo() ;
}
func1() {
   f = foo() ;
} In traditional C, the function foo() would be of type float when it is invoked in the function func1(), since the declaration for foo() had file scope, even though it occurred within a function. ANSI C dictates that the declaration for foo() has block scope. Thus, there is no declaration for foo() in scope in func1(), and it is implicitly typed int. This difference in typing between the explicitly and implicitly declared versions of foo() results in a redeclaration error at compile time, since they both are linked to the same external definition for foo()ID="chap0314" and the difference in typing could otherwise produce unexpected behavior.LBL="" HELPID=""Name Space ChangesANSI C recognizes four distinct name spaces: one for ID="chap0315"tags, one for labels, one for members of a particular struct or union, and one for everything else. This division creates two discrepancies with traditional C:In ANSI C, each struct or union has its own name space for its members. This is a pointed departure from traditional C, in which these members were nothing more than offsets, allowing you to use a member with a structure to which it does not belong. This usage is illegal in ANSI C. ID="chap0316"ID="chap0317"Enumeration constants were special identifiers in versions of Silicon Graphics C prior to IRIX Release 3.3. In ANSI C, these constants are simply integer constants that can be used anywhere they are appropriate. Similarly, in ANSI C, other integer variables can be assigned to a variable of an enumeration type with no error. ID="chap0318"ID="chap0319"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="40124"Changes in the Linkage of IdentifiersAn identifier's linkage determines which of the references to that identifier refer to the same object. This terminology formalizes the familiar concept of variables declared extern and variables declared static and is a necessary augmentation to the concept of scope. ID="chap0320"extern int mytime;
static int yourtime; In the example above, both mytime and yourtime have file scope. However, mytime has external linkage, while yourtime has internal linkage. An object can also have no linkage, as is the case of automatic variables. The above example illustrates another implicit difference between the declarations of mytime and yourtime. The declaration of yourtime allocates storage for the object, whereas the declaration of mytime merely references it. If mytime is initialized as follows: int mytime=0; This also allocates storage. In ANSI C terminology, a declaration that allocates storage is referred to as a definition. Herein lies the change.In traditional C, neither of the declarations below was a definition.extern int bert;
int bert; In effect, the second declaration included an implicit extern specification. This is not true in ANSI C. Note
Objects with external linkage that are not specified as extern at the end of the compilation unit are considered definitions, and, in effect, initialized to zero. (If multiple declarations of the object are in the compilation unit, only one needs the extern specification.) ID="chap0321"The effect of this change is to produce "multiple definition" messages from the linker when two modules contain definitions of the same identifier, even though neither is explicitly initialized. This is often referred to as the strict ref/def model. A more relaxed model can be achieved by using the compiler flag ID="chap0322"­common.The ANSI C linker issues a warning when it finds redundant definitions, indicating the modules that produced the conflict. However, the linker cannot determine whether the definition of the object is explicit. The result may be incorrectly initialized objects, if a definition was given with an explicit initialization, and this definition is not the linker's random choice.Thus, consider the following example: module1.c:   int ernie;
module2.c:
   int ernie=5; ANSI C implicitly initializes ernie in module1.c to zero. To the linker, ernie is initialized in two different modules. The linker warns you of this situation, and chooses the first such module it encounters as the true definition of ernie. This module may or may not contain the explicitly initialized copy.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="30681"Types and Type CompatibilityHistorically, C has allowed free mixing of arithmetic types in expressions and as arguments to functions. (Arithmetic types include integral and floating point types. Pointer types are not included.) C's type promotion rules reduced the number of actual types used in arithmetic expressions and as arguments to three: int, unsigned, and double. This scheme allowed free mixing of types, but in some cases forced unnecessary conversions and complexity in the generated code.    ID="chap0323"ID="chap0324"ID="chap0325"ID="chap0326"One ubiquitous example of unnecessary conversions is when ID="chap0327"float variables were used as arguments to a function. C's type promotion rules often caused two unwanted expensive conversions across a function boundary.ANSI C has altered these rules somewhat to avoid the unnecessary overhead in many C implementations. This alteration, however, may produce differences in arithmetic and pointer expressions and in argument passing. For a complete discussion of operator conversions and type promotions, see IDREF="61724" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 6, "Operator Conversions."LBL="" HELPID=""Type Promotion in Arithmetic ExpressionsTwo differences are noteworthy between ANSI and traditional C. First, ANSI C relaxes the restriction that all floating point calculations must be performed in double precision. In the example below, pre-ANSI C compilers are required to convert each operand to double, perform the operation in double precision, and truncate the result to float. ID="chap0328"extern float f,f0,f1; 
addf() {
   f = f0 + f1;
} These steps are not required in ANSI C. In ANSI C, the operation can be done entirely in single-precision. (In traditional C, these operations were performed in single-precision if the ­float compiler option was selected.)ID="chap0329"ID="chap0330"ID="chap0331"The second difference in arithmetic expression evaluation involves integral promotions. ANSI C dictates that any integral promotions be value-preserving. Traditional C used unsignedness-preserving promotions. Consider the example below: ID="chap0332"ID="chap0333"unsigned short us=1,them=2;
int i;
test() {
   i = us - them;
} ANSI C's value-preserving rules cause each of us and them to be promoted to int, which is the expression type. The unsignedness-preserving rules, in traditional C, cause each of us and them to be promoted to unsigned, which is the expression type. The latter case yields a large unsigned number, whereas ANSI C yields -1. The discrepancy in this case is inconsequential, as the same bit pattern is stored in the integer i in both cases, and it is later interpreted as -1. However, if the case is altered slightly as in the following example:unsigned short us=1,them=2;
float f;
test() {
   f = us - them;
} The result assigned to f is quite different under the two schemes. If you use the ­wlint option, you'll be warned about the implicit conversions from int or unsigned to float.For more information on arithmetic conversions, see IDREF="26274" TYPE="TITLE""Arithmetic Conversions".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="55446"Type Promotion and Floating-Point ConstantsThe differences in behavior of ANSI C floating-point constants and traditional C floating point constants can cause numerical and performance differences in code ported from the traditional C to the ANSI C compiler.ID="chap0334"For example, consider the result type of the computation below:#define PI 3.1415926
float a,b;

b = a * PI;The result type of b depends on which compilation options you use. IDREF="54517" TYPE="TABLE"Table 3-1 lists the effects of various options.COLUMNS="3"LBL="3-1"Table 3-1

			descr='[mdash]'and thus promoting the computation to double precision multipliesname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

To continue the example, use:#define PI 3.1415926f    /* single precision float */Traditional C (compiled with the ­cckr option) doesn't recognize the f float qualifier, however. You may want to write the constant definition like this:#ifdef __STDC__
#define PI 3.1415926f
#else
#define PI 3.1415926
#endifIf you compile with the ­ansi or ­xansi options, __STDC__ is automatically defined as though ­D__STDC__ = 1 were used on your compilation line.If you compile with the ­ansi, ­ansiposix or ­xansi options, __STDC__ is automatically defined, as though you used ­D__STDC__=1 on your compilation line.

After promotion, using the appropriate set of promotion rules, two non-pointer types are compatible if they have the same size, signedness, integer/float characteristic, or, in the case of aggregates, are of the same structure or union type. Except as discussed in the previous section, no surprises should result from these changes. You should not encounter unexpected problems unless you are using pointers. ID="chap0335"ID="chap0336"Pointers are compatible if they point to compatible types. No default promotion rules apply to pointers. Under traditional C, the following code fragment compiled silently: int *iptr; 
unsigned int *uiptr; 
foo() {
   iptr = uiptr; 
} Under ANSI C, the pointers iptr and uiptr do not point to compatible types (as they differ in unsignedness), which means that the assignment is illegal. Insert the appropriate cast to alleviate the problem. When the underlying pointer type is irrelevant or variable, use the wildcard type void *. LBL="" HELPID=""Argument Type PromotionsANSI C rules for the promotion of arithmetic types when passing arguments to a function depend on whether or not a prototype is in scope for the function at the point of the call. If a prototype is not in scope, the arguments are converted using the default argument promotion rules: short and char types (whether signed or unsigned) are passed as ints, other integral quantities are not changed, and floating point quantities are passed as doubles. These rules are also used for arguments in the variable-argument portion of a function whose prototype ends in ellipses (name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188).ID="chap0337"If a prototype is in scope, an attempt is made to convert each argument to the type indicated in the prototype prior to the call. The types of conversions that succeed are similar to those that succeed in expressions. Thus, an int is promoted to a float if the prototype so indicates, but a pointer to unsigned is not converted to a pointer to int. ANSI C also allows the implementation greater freedom when passing integral arguments if a prototype is in scope. If it makes sense for an implementation to pass short arguments as 16-bit quantities, it can do so.Use of prototypes when calling functions allows greater ease in coding. However, due to the differences in argument promotion rules, serious discrepancies can occur if a function is called both with and without a prototype in scope. Make sure that you use prototypes consistently and that any prototype is declared to be in scope for all uses of the function identifier. LBL="" HELPID=""Mixed Use of FunctionsTo reduce the chances of problems occurring when calling a function with and without a prototype in scope, limit the types of arithmetic arguments in function declarations. In particular, avoid using short or char types for arguments; their use rarely improves performance and may raise portability issues if you move your code to a machine with a smaller word size. This is because function calls made with and without a prototype in scope may promote the arguments differently. In addition, be circumspect when typing a function argument float, because you can encounter difficulties if the function is called without a prototype in scope. With these issues in mind, you can solve quickly the few problems that may arise. ID="chap0338"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="93558"Function PrototypesFunction prototypes are not new to Silicon Graphics C. In traditional C, however, the implementation of prototypes was incomplete. In one case, shown below, a significant difference still exists between the ANSI C and the traditional C implementations of prototypes. ID="chap0339"ID="chap0340"You can prototype functions in two ways. The most common method is to simply create a copy of the function declaration with the arguments typed, with or without identifiers for each, such as either of the following: int func(int, float, unsigned [2]);
int func(int i, float f, unsigned u[2]); You can also prototype a function by writing the function definition in prototype form, as: int func(int i, float f, unsigned u[2])
{
   < code for func >
} In each case, a prototype is created for func() that remains in scope for the rest of the compilation unit.One area of confusion about function prototypes is that you must write functions that have prototypes in prototype form. Unless you do this, the default argument promotion rules apply.ANSI C elicits an error diagnostics for two incompatible types for the same parameter in two declarations of the same function. Traditional C elicits an error diagnostics when the incompatibility may lead to a difference between the bit-pattern of the value passed in by the caller and the bit-pattern seen in the parameter by the callee.As an example, the function func() below is declared twice with incompatible parameter profiles.int func (float);
int func (f)
float f;
{ name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188 }The parameter f in func() is assumed to be type double, because the default argument promotions apply. Error diagnostics in traditional C and ANSI C are elicited about the two incompatible declarations for func(). The following three situations produce diagnostics from the ANSI C compiler when you use function prototypes:A prototyped function is called with one or more arguments of incompatible type. (Incompatible types are discussed in Section 3.3.) ID="chap0341"ID="chap0342"ID="chap0343"Two incompatible (explicit or implicit) declarations for the same function are encountered.

Each constant has a type, determined by its form and value.ID="chap0414"In the following discussion of the various types of constants, a unary operator preceding the constant is not considered part of it. Rather, such a construct is a constant-expression (see IDREF="72985" TYPE="TITLE""Constant Expressions"). Thus, the integer constant 0xff becomes an integral constant expression by prefixing a minus sign, as -0xff. The effect of the operator ­ is not considered in the discussion of integer constants.ID="chap0415"As an example, the integer constant 0xffffffff has type int in traditional C, with value -1. It has type unsigned in ANSI C, with value 232­1. This discrepancy is inconsequential if the constant is assigned to a variable of integral type (for example, int or unsigned), as a conversion occurs. If it is assigned to a double, however, the value differs as indicated between traditional and ANSI C. LBL="" HELPID=""Integer ConstantsAn integer constant consisting of a sequence of digits is considered octal if it begins with 0. An octal constant consists of the digits 0 through 7 only. A sequence of digits preceded by 0x or 0X is considered a hexadecimal integer.

These suffixes are allowed, but are superfluous, since int andID="chap0418" long are the same size in ­32 mode. The suffices ll, LL, lL, and Ll indicate a long long constant (a 64-bit integral type).

The storage class determined the location and lifetime of the storage associated with an identifier; the type determined the meaning of the values found in the identifier's storage. Informally, name space, scope, and linkage were also considered.ANSI C formalizes the practices of traditional C. An ANSI C identifier is disambiguated by four characteristics: its scope, name space, linkage, and storage duration. The ANSI C definitions of these terms differ somewhat from their interpretations in traditional C.Storage-class specifiers and their meanings are described in IDREF="87922" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 8, "Declarations." Storage-class specifiers are discussed in this chapter only in terms of their effect on an object's storage duration and linkage.This chapter contains the following sections:IDREF="39439" TYPE="TITLE""Disambiguating Names" discusses scope, name spaces, linkage, and storage duration as means of distinguishing identifiers.IDREF="64032" TYPE="TITLE""Types" describes the three fundamental object types.IDREF="23437" TYPE="TITLE""Objects and lvalues" briefly defines those two terms.You can find a discussion of some of this material, focusing on changes to the language, in IDREF="36460" TYPE="TITLE""Changes in Disambiguating Identifiers" and IDREF="30681" TYPE="TITLE""Types and Type Compatibility".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="39439"Disambiguating NamesThis section discusses the ways C disambiguates names: scope, name space, linkage, and storage class.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="92800"ScopeThe region of a program in which a given instance of an identifier is visible is called its scope. The scope of an identifier usually begins when its declaration is seen, or, in the case of labels and functions, when it is implied by use. Although it is impossible to have two declarations of the same identifier active in the same scope, no conflict occurs if the instances are in different scopes.

			descr='[mdash]'that is, variables declared within a function. Each block has its own scope. No conflict occurs if the same identifier is declared in two blocks. If one block encloses the other, the declaration in the enclosed block hides that in the enclosing block until the end of the enclosed block is reached. The definition of a block is the same in ANSI C and traditional C, with one exception, illustrated by the example below:int f(x) 
int x; 
{
    int x;
    x = 1;
}In ANSI C, the function arguments are in the function body block. Thus, ANSI C complains of a "redeclaration of x."In traditional C, the function arguments are in a separate block that encloses the function body block. Thus, traditional C would quietly hide the argumentx with the local variable x, as they are in distinct blocks.ANSI C and traditional C differ in the assignment of block and file scope in a few instances. See the following discussion of file scope. LBL="" HELPID=""Function ScopeOnly labels have function scope. Function scope continues until the end of the current function. ID="chap054"ID="chap055"LBL="" HELPID=""Function Prototype ScopeIf an identifier appears within the list of parameter declarations in a function prototype that is not part of a function definition (see IDREF="95935" TYPE="TITLE""Function Declarators and Prototypes"), it has function prototype scope, which terminates at the end of the prototype. This termination allows any dummy parameter names appearing in a function prototype to disappear at the end of the prototype.   ID="chap056"ID="chap057"LBL="" HELPID=""File ScopeIdentifiers appearing outside of any block, function, or function prototype, have ID="chap058"ID="chap059"file scope. This scope continues to the end of the compilation unit. Unlike other scopes, multiple declarations of the same identifier with file scope can exist in a compilation unit, so long as the declarations are compatible.Whereas ANSI C assigns block scope to all declarations occurring inside a function, traditional C assigns file scope to such declarations if they have the storage class extern. This storage class is implied in all function declarations, whether the declaration is explicit (as in int foo();) or implicit (if there is no active declaration for foo() when an invocation is encountered, as in f = foo();). For a further discussion of this discrepancy, with examples, see IDREF="45081" TYPE="TITLE""Scoping Differences".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="16739"Name SpacesIn certain cases, the purpose for which an identifier is used may disambiguate it from other uses of the same identifier appearing in the same scope. This is true, for example, for tags, and is used in traditional C to avoid conflicts between identifiers used as tags and those used in object or function declarations. ANSI C formalizes this mechanism by defining certain ID="chap0510"name spaces. These name spaces are completely independent. A member of one name space cannot conflict with a member of another. ANSI C recognizes four distinct name spaces:Tagsstruct, union, and enum tags have a single name space. ID="chap0511"LabelsLabels are in their own name space. ID="chap0512"MembersEach struct or union has its own name space for its members. ID="chap0513"ID="chap0514"ID="chap0515"ID="chap0516"Ordinary identifiersOrdinary identifiers, including function and object names as well as user-defined type names, are placed in the last name space. ID="chap0517"ID="chap0518"LBL="" HELPID=""Name Space Discrepancies Between Traditional and ANSI CThe definition of name spaces causes discrepancies between traditional and ANSI C in a few situations: ID="chap0519"Structure members in traditional C were nothing more than offsets, allowing the use of a member with a structure to which it does not belong. This is illegal under ANSI C. Enumeration constants were special identifiers in traditional C prior to IRIX Release 3.3. In later releases of traditional C, as in ANSI C, these constants are simply integer constants that can be used anywhere they are appropriate. Labels reside in the same name space as ordinary identifiers in traditional C. Thus the following example is legal in ANSI C but not in traditional C. func() { 
int lab;
   if (lab) goto lab;
   func1() ; 
lab:
   return; 
}LBL="" HELPID=""Linkage of IdentifiersTwo instances of the same identifier appearing in different scopes may, in fact, refer to the same entity. For example, the references to a variable counter declared with file scope as shown below:ID="chap0520"ID="chap0521"extern int counter;In this example, two separate files refer to the same int object. The association between the references to an identifier occurring in distinct scopes and the underlying objects are determined by the identifier's linkage.The three kinds of linkage are:Internal linkage Within a file, all declarations of the same identifier with internal linkage denote the same object. ID="chap0522"External linkageWithin an entire program, all declarations of an identifier with external linkage denote the same object. ID="chap0523"No linkageA unique entity, accessible only in its own scope, has no linkage. ID="chap0524"An identifier's linkage is determined by whether it appears inside or outside a function, whether it appears in a declaration of a function (as opposed to an object), its storage-class specifier, and the linkage of any previous declarations of the same identifier that have file scope. It is determined as follows:If an identifier is declared with file scope and the storage-class specifier static, it has internal linkage. If the identifier is declared with the storage-class specifier extern, or is an explicit or implicit function declaration with block scope, the identifier has the same linkage as any previous declaration of the same identifier with file scope. If no previous declaration exists, the identifier has external linkage. If an identifier for an object is declared with file scope and no storage-class specifier, it has external linkage. (See IDREF="40124" TYPE="TITLE""Changes in the Linkage of Identifiers".)All other identifiers have no linkage. This includes all identifiers that do not denote an object or function, all objects with block scope declared without the storage-class specifier extern, and all identifiers that are not members of the ordinary variables name space.Two declarations of the same identifier in a single file that have the same linkage, either internal or external, refer to the same object. The same identifier cannot appear in a file with both internal and external linkage.This code gives an example where the linkage of each declaration is the same in both traditional and ANSI C:static int pete; 
extern int bert; 
int mom; 
int func0() {
    extern int mom;
    extern int pete;
    static int dad;
    int bert;
    ...  
} 
int func1() {
    static int mom;
    extern int dad;
    extern int bert;
    ...  
}The declaration of pete with file scope has internal linkage by rule 1 above. This means that the declaration of pete in func0() also has internal linkage by rule 2 and refers to the same object.By rule 2, the declaration of bert with file scope has external linkage, since there is no previous declaration of bert with file scope. Thus, the declaration of bert in func1() also has external linkage (again by rule 2) and refers to the same (external) object. By rule 4, however, the declaration of bert in func0() has no linkage, and refers to a unique object.The declaration of mom with file scope has external linkage by rule 3, and, by rule 2, so does the declaration of mom in func0(). (Again, two declarations of the same identifier in a single file that both have either internal or external linkage refer to the same object.) The declaration of mom in func1(), however, has no linkage by rule 4 and thus refers to a unique object.Last, the declarations of dad in func0() and func1() refer to different objects, as the former has no linkage and the latter, by rule 2, has external linkage. LBL="" HELPID=""Linkage Discrepancies Between Traditional and ANSI CTraditional and ANSI C differ on the concept of linkage in the following important ways:In traditional C, a function can be declared with block scope and the storage-class specifier static. The declaration is given internal linkage. Only the storage class extern can be specified in function declarations with block scope in ANSI C. In traditional C, if an object is declared with block scope and the storage-class specifier static, and a declaration for the object with file scope and internal linkage exists, the block scope declaration has internal linkage. In ANSI C, an object declared with block scope and the storage-class specifier static has no linkage.Traditional and ANSI C handle the concepts of reference and definition differently. For example:extern int mytime; 
static int yourtime;In the example above, both mytime and yourtime have file scope. As discussed previously, mytime has external linkage, while yourtime has internal linkage. However, there is an implicit differencename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'which exists in both ANSI and traditional Cname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'between the declarations of mytime and yourtime in the above example. The declaration of yourtime allocates storage for the object, whereas the declaration of mytime merely references it. If mytime had been initialized, as in the following example, it would also have allocated storage. int mytime=0;A declaration that allocates storage is referred to as a definition. In traditional C, neither of the two declarations below is a definition.extern int bert; 
int bert;In effect, the second declaration includes an implicit extern specification. ANSI C does not include such an implicit specification. Note
In ANSI C, objects with external linkage that are not specified as extern at the end of the compilation unit are considered definitions, and, in effect, initialized to zero. (If multiple declarations of the object occur in the compilation unit, only one need have the extern specification.) If two modules contain definitions of the same identifier, the linker complains of "multiple definitions," even though neither is explicitly initialized.The ANSI C linker issues a warning when it finds redundant definitions, indicating the modules that produced the conflict. However, the linker cannot determine if the initialization of the object is explicit. The result may be incorrectly initialized objects, if another module fails to tag the object with extern.Thus, consider the following example:module1.c:     int ernie;
module2.c: 
    int ernie=5;ANSI C implicitly initializes ernie in module1.c to zero. To the linker, ernie is initialized in two different modules. The linker warns you of this situation, and chooses the first such module it encountered as the true definition of ernie. This module may or may not be the one containing the explicitly initialized copy. LBL="" HELPID=""Storage DurationStorage duration denotes the lifetime of an object. Storage duration is of two types: static and automatic.   ID="chap0525"ID="chap0526"ID="chap0527"Objects declared with external or internal linkage, or with the storage-class specifier static, have static storage duration. If these objects are initialized, the initialization occurs once, prior to any reference.Other objects have automatic storage duration. Storage is newly allocated for these objects each time the block that contains their declaration is entered. If an object with automatic storage duration is initialized, the initialization occurs each time the block is entered at the top. It is not guaranteed to occur if the block is entered by a jump to a labeled statement.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="64032"TypesThe C language supports three fundamental types of objects: character, integer, and floating point.   ID="chap0528"ID="chap0529"LBL="" HELPID=""Character TypesObjects declared as characters (char) are large enough to store any member of the implementation's character set. If a genuine character from that character set is stored in a char variable, its value is equivalent to the integer code for that character. Other quantities may be stored into character variables, but the implementation is machine dependent. In this implementation, char is unsigned by default.   ID="chap0530"ID="chap0531"ID="chap0532"The ANSI C standard has added multibyte and wide character types. In the initial Silicon Graphics release of ANSI C, wide characters are of type unsigned char, and multibyte characters are of length one. (See the header files <stddef.h> and <limits.h> for more information.) Because of their initial limited implementation in this release, this document includes little discussion of wide and multibyte character types. ID="chap0533"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="11806"Integer and Floating Point TypesUp to five sizes of integral types (signed and unsigned) are available: char, short, int, long, and long long.

Types long and int have different sizes (and ranges) in 64-bit mode; type long always has the same size as a pointer value. A pointer (or address) has a 64-bit representation in 64-bit mode and a 32-bit representation in 32-bit mode. Hence, an int object has a smaller size than a pointer object in 64-bit mode.The ID="chap0542"long long type is not a valid ANSI C type, hence a warning is elicited for every occurrence of "long long" in the source program text in ­ansi and ­ansiposix modes.

The range of a signed integral type of size n is [(-2n-1)... (2n-1 -1)]. The range of an unsigned version of the type is [0... (2n -1)].Enumeration constants were special identifiers under various versions of traditional C, prior to IRIX Release 3.3. In ANSI C, these constants are simply integer constants that may be used anywhere. Similarly, ANSI C allows the assignment of other integer variables to variables of enumeration type, with no error. ID="chap0552"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="54350"Derived TypesBecause objects of the types mentioned in IDREF="11806" TYPE="TITLE""Integer and Floating Point Types" can be interpreted usefully as numbers, this manual refers to them as arithmetic types. The types char, enum, and int of all sizes (whether unsigned or not) are collectively called integral types. The float and double types are collectively called floating types. Arithmetic types and pointers are collectively called as scalar types.           ID="chap0553"ID="chap0554"ID="chap0555"ID="chap0556"ID="chap0557"ID="chap0558"ID="chap0559"ID="chap0560"ID="chap0561"ID="chap0562"ID="chap0563"The fundamental arithmetic types can be used to construct a conceptually infinite class of derived types, such as:arrays of objects of most typesfunctions that return objects of a given typepointers to objects of a given typestructures that contain a sequence of objects of various typesunions capable of containing any one of several objects of various typesIn general, these constructed objects can be used as building blocks for other constructed objects.LBL="" HELPID=""The void TypeThe void type specifies an empty set of values. It is used as the type returned by functions that generate no value. The void type never refers to an object, and is therefore not included in any reference to object types. ID="chap0564"ID="chap0565"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="23437"Objects and lvaluesAn ID="chap0566"ID="chap0567"object is a manipulatable region of storage. An lvalue is an expression referring to an object. An obvious example of an lvalue expression is an identifier. Some operators yield lvalues. For example, if E is an expression of pointer type, then *E is an lvalue expression referring to the object to which E points. The term lvalue comes from the term "left value." In the assignment expression E1= E2, the left operand E1 must be an lvalue expression. Most lvalues are modifiable, meaning that the lvalue may be used to modify the object to which it refers. Examples of lvalues that are not modifiable include array names, lvalues with incomplete type, and lvalues that refer to an object, part or all of which is qualified with const (see IDREF="22645" TYPE="TITLE""Type Qualifiers"). Whether an lvalue appearing in an expression must be modifiable is usually obvious. For example, in the assignment expression E1 = E2, E1 must be modifiable. This document makes the distinction between modifiable and unmodifiable lvalues only when it is not obvious.LBL="6"ID="61724"Operator ConversionsA number of operators can, depending on the types of their operands, cause an implicit conversion of some operands from one type to another. The following discussion explains the results you can expect from these conversions. The conversions demanded by most operators are summarized in IDREF="26274" TYPE="TITLE""Arithmetic Conversions". As necessary, a discussion of the individual operators supplements the summary.ID="chap061"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="33317"Conversions of Characters and IntegersYou can use a character or a short integer wherever you can use an integer. Characters are unsigned by default. In all cases, the value is converted to an integer. Conversion of a shorter integer to a longer integer preserves the sign. Traditional C uses "unsigned preserving integer promotion" (unsigned ID="chap062"short to unsigned int), while ANSI C uses "value preserving integer promotion" (unsigned short to int).A longer integer is truncated on the left when converted to a shorter integer or to a char. Excess bits are simply discarded.   ID="chap063"ID="chap064"ID="chap065"LBL="" HELPID=""Conversions of Float and DoubleHistorically in C, expressions containing floating point operands (either ID="chap066"float or double) were calculated using double precision. This is also true of calculations in traditional C, unless you've specified the compiler option ­float. With the ­float option, calculations involving floating point operands and no double or long double operands take place in single precision. The ­float option has no effect on argument promotion rules at function calls or on function prototypes.ANSI C performs calculations involving floating point in the same precision as if ­float had been specified in traditional C, except when floating point constants are involved. In traditional C, specifying theID="chap067" ­float option coerces floating point constants into type float if all the other subexpressions are of type float. This is not the case in ANSI C. ANSI C considers all floating point constants to be implicitly double precision, and arithmetics involving such constants therefore take place in double precision. To force single precision arithmetic in ANSI C, use the f or F suffix on floating point constants. To force long double precision on constants, use the l or L suffix. For example, 3.14l is long double precision, 3.14 is double precision, and 3.14f is single precision in ANSI C.For a complete discussion with examples, see IDREF="55446" TYPE="TITLE""Type Promotion and Floating-Point Constants".LBL="" HELPID=""Conversion of Floating and Integral TypesConversions between floating and integral values are machine dependent. Silicon Graphics uses IEEE floating point, in which the default rounding mode is to nearest, or in case of a tie, to even. Floating point rounding modes can be controlled using the facilities of fpc(3c). Floating point exception conditions are discussed in the introductory paragraph of IDREF="74335" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 7, "Expressions and Operators."When a floating value is converted to an integral value, the rounded value is preserved as long as it does not overflow. When an integral value is converted to a floating value, the value is preserved unless a value of more than six significant digits is being converted to single precision, or fifteen significant digits is being converted to double precision.LBL="" HELPID=""Conversion of Pointers and IntegersAn expression of integral type can be added to or subtracted from an object pointer. In such a case, the integer expression is converted as specified in the discussion of the addition operator in IDREF="48455" TYPE="TITLE""Additive Operators". Two pointers to objects of the same type can be subtracted. In this case, the result is converted to an integer as specified in the discussion of the subtraction operator, in IDREF="48455" TYPE="TITLE""Additive Operators".   ID="chap068"ID="chap069"ID="chap0610"LBL="" HELPID=""Conversion of Unsigned IntegersWhen an unsigned integer is converted to a longer unsigned or signed integer, the value of the result is preserved. Thus, the conversion amounts to padding with zeros on the left.   ID="chap0611"ID="chap0612"ID="chap0613"When an unsigned integer is converted to a shorter signed or unsigned integer, the value is truncated on the left. This truncation may produce a negative value, if the result is signed.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="26274"Arithmetic ConversionsMany types of operations in C require two operands to be converted to a common type. Two sets of conversion rules are applied to accomplish this conversion. The first, referred to as the integral promotions, defines how integral types are promoted to one of several integral types that are at least as large as int. The second, called the usual arithmetic conversions, derives a common type in which the operation is performed. ID="chap0614"ID="chap0615"ANSI C and traditional C follow different sets of these rules.LBL="" HELPID=""Integral PromotionsThe difference between the ANSI C and traditional versions of the conversion rules is that the traditional C rules emphasize preservation of the (un)signedness of a quantity, while ANSI C rules emphasize preservation of its value. ID="chap0616"ID="chap0617"ID="chap0618"In traditional C, operands of types char, unsigned char, and unsigned short are converted to unsigned int. Operands of types signed char and short are converted to int.ANSI C converts all char and short operands, whether signed or unsigned, to int. Only operands of type unsigned int, unsigned long, and unsigned long long may remain unsigned.LBL="" HELPID=""Usual Arithmetic ConversionsBesides differing in emphasis on signedness and value preservation, the usual arithmetic conversion rules of ANSI C and traditional C also differ in the precision of the chosen floating point type. ID="chap0619"ID="chap0620"Below are two sets of conversion rules, one for traditional C, and the other for ANSI C. Each set is ordered in decreasing precedence. In any particular case, the rule that applies is the first whose conditions are met.Each rule specifies a type, referred to as the result type.

The resultant pointer points to the initial element of the array. In this case, the resultant pointer ceases to be an lvalue. (For a discussion of lvalues, see IDREF="23437" TYPE="TITLE""Objects and lvalues".)    ID="chap0627"ID="chap0628"ID="chap0629"ID="chap0630"A function designator is an expression that has function type. Except as noted, a function designator appearing as an operand is converted to an expression of type pointer to function.LBL="" HELPID=""Conversion of Void ObjectsThe (nonexistent) value of a void object cannot be used in any way, and neither explicit nor implicit conversion can be applied.  Because a ID="chap0631"ID="chap0632"void expression denotes a nonexistent value, such an expression can be used only as an expression statement (see IDREF="10732" TYPE="TITLE""Expression Statement"), or as the left operand of a comma expression (see IDREF="11638" TYPE="TITLE""Comma Operator").An expression can be converted to type void by use of a cast. For example, this makes explicit the discarding of the value of a function call used as an expression statement.LBL="" HELPID=""Conversion of PointersA pointer to void can be converted to a pointer to any object type and back without change in the underlying value.    ID="chap0633"ID="chap0634"ID="chap0635"ID="chap0636"The NULL pointer constant can be specified either as the integral value zero, or the value zero cast to a ID="chap0637"pointer to void. If a NULL pointer constant is assigned or compared to a pointer to any type, it is appropriately converted.LBL="7"ID="74335"Expressions and OperatorsThe precedence of expression operators is indicated by their syntax in this chapter; it usually follows the order of the major subsections, with earlier subsections having higher precedence. For example, since the multiplication operator * can have a unary-expression (which is a cast-expression) as well as an operand, the order of evaluation of the expression ~ i * z gives ~ higher precedence than * and can be written( ~ i ) * zThe text indicates this precedence by placing unary-expressions in IDREF="22392" TYPE="TITLE""Unary Operators", and multiplicative-expressions in IDREF="31930" TYPE="TITLE""Multiplicative Operators". This syntax­subsection correlation is violated in a few cases. For example, cast-expressions can be operands in unary-expressions, in which case the cast-expression has higher precedence.

The compiler can arbitrarily rearrange expressions involving a commutative and associative operator (ID="chap074"ID="chap075"ID="chap076"*, +, &, |, ^).Integer divide-by-zero results in a trap. Other integer exception conditions are ignored. Silicon Graphics floating point conforms to the IEEE standard. Floating point exceptions are ignored by default, yielding the default IEEE results of infinity for divide-by-zero and overflow, not-a-number for invalid operations, and zero for underflow. You can gain control over these exceptions and their results most easily by using the Silicon Graphics IEEE floating point exception handler package (see handle_sigfpes(3c)).

If the postfix­expression denoting the called function consists solely of a previously unseen identifier foo, the call produces an implicit declaration as if, in the innermost block containing the call, the declaration had appeared: ID="chap0724"ID="chap0725"ID="chap0726"extern int foo(); If a corresponding function prototype that specifies a type for the argument being evaluated is in force, an attempt is made to convert the argument to that type. If the number of arguments does not agree with the number of parameters specified in the prototype, the behavior is undefined. If the type returned by the function as specified in the prototype does not agree with the type derived from the postfix-expression denoting the called function, the behavior is undefined. Such a scenario may occur for an external function declared with conflicting prototypes in different files. If no corresponding prototype is in scope or the argument is in the variable argument section of a prototype that ends in ellipses (name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188), the argument is converted according to the following default argument promotions:    ID="chap0727"ID="chap0728"ID="chap0729"Type float is converted to double. Array and function names are converted to corresponding pointers. When using traditional C: types unsigned short and unsigned char are converted to unsigned int. types signed short and signed char are converted to signed int. When using ANSI C: types short and char, whether signed or unsigned, are converted to int.In preparing for the call to a function, a copy is made of each actual argument. Thus, all argument passing in C is strictly by value. A function can change the values of its parameters, but these changes cannot affect the values of the actual arguments. It is possible to pass a pointer on the understanding that the function can change the value of the object to which the pointer points. (Arguments that are array names can be changed as well, since these arguments are converted to pointer expressions.) Since the order of evaluation of arguments is unspecified, side effects may be delayed until the next sequence point, which occurs at the point of the actual callname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'after all arguments have been evaluated. (For example, the incrementation of foo, which is a side-effect of the evaluation of an argument foo++, may be delayed.) Recursive calls to any function are permitted. ID="chap0730"ID="chap0731"Silicon Graphics recommends consistent use of prototypes for function declarations and definitions, as it is extremely dangerous to mix prototyped and nonprototyped function declarations/definitions. Never call functions before you declare them (although the language allows this).

Declarations with typedefID="chap0830" names are discussed in IDREF="18668" TYPE="TITLE""typedef". LBL="" HELPID=""ID="82788"Structure and Union DeclarationsA structure is an object consisting of a sequence of named members. Each member can have any type. A union is an object that can, at a given time, contain any one of several members. Structure and union specifiers have the same form. The syntax is:     ID="chap0831"ID="chap0832"ID="chap0833"ID="chap0834"ID="chap0835"ID="chap0836"struct-or-union-specifier:struct-or-union {struct-decl-list}struct-or-union identifier {struct-decl-list}struct-or-union identifierstruct-or-union:structunionThe struct-decl-list is a sequence of declarations for the members of the structure or union. The syntax is:struct-decl-list:struct-declarationstruct-decl-list struct-declaration struct-declaration:specifier-qualifier-list struct-declarator-list; struct-declarator-list:struct-declaratorstruct-declarator-list , struct-declarator In the usual case, a struct-declarator is just a declarator for a member of a structure or union. A structure member can also consist of a specified number of bits. Such a member is also called a bitfield. Its length, a non-negative constant expression, is separated from the field name by a colon. IDREF="54482" TYPE="TITLE""Bitfields" are discussed at the end of this section. The syntax for struct-declarator is:struct-declarator:declaratordeclarator : constant-expression: constant-expression A struct or union cannot contain a member with incomplete or function type, or that is an instance of itself. It can, however, contain a member that is a pointer to an instance of itself.ID="chap0837"Within a structure, the objects declared have addresses that increase as the declarations are read left to right. Each non-field member of a structure begins on an addressing boundary appropriate to its type; therefore, there may be unnamed holes in a structure.A union can be thought of as a structure whose members all begin at offset 0 and whose size is sufficient to contain any of its members. At most, one of the members can be stored in a union at any time.A structure or union specifier of the second form declares the identifier to be the structure tag (or union tag) of the structure specified by the list. This type of specifier is one ofstruct identifier {struct-decl-list}union identifier {struct-decl-list} A subsequent declaration can use the third form of specifier, one ofstruct identifierunion identifierStructure tags allow definition of self-referential structures. Structure tags also permit the long part of the declaration to be given once and used several times.The third form of a structure or union specifier can be used prior to a declaration that gives the complete specification of the structure or union in situations in which the size of the structure or union is unnecessary. The size is unnecessary in two situations: when a pointer to a structure or union is being declared and when a typedef name is declared to be a synonym for a structure or union. This, for example, allows the declaration of a pair of structures that contain pointers to each other. ID="chap0838"The names of members of each struct or union have their own name space, and do not conflict with each other or with ordinary variables. A particular member name cannot be used twice in the same structure, but it can be used in several different structures in the same scope. Names that are used for tags reside in a single name space. They do not conflict with other names or with names used for tags in an enclosing scope. This tag name space, however, consists of tag names used for all struct, union, or enum declarations. Thus the tag name of an enum may conflict with the tag name of a struct in the same scope. (See IDREF="39439" TYPE="TITLE""Disambiguating Names".)ID="chap0839"A simple but important example of a structure declaration is the following binary tree structure: struct tnode {
char tword[20];
int count;
struct tnode *left;
struct tnode *right; 
}; This structure contains an array of 20 characters, an integer, and two pointers to instances of itself. Once this declaration has been given, the declaration declares s to be a structure of the given sort and sp to be a pointer to a structure of the given sort. For example:struct tnode s, *sp; With these declarations, the expression sp->count refers to the count field of the structure to which sp points. The expression s.left refers to the left subtree pointer of the structure s. The expression s.right->tword[0] refers to the first character of the tword member of the right subtree of s. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="54482"BitfieldsA structure member can consist of a specified number of bits, called a bitfield. Bitfields should be of type int, signed int, or unsigned int in strict ANSI C mode. Silicon Graphics allows bitfields of any integral type, but warn for non-int types in ­ansi and ­ansiposix modes.The default type of field members is int, but whether it is signed or unsigned int is defined by the implementation. It is thus wise to specify the signedness of bitfields when they are declared. In this implementation, the default type of a bitfield is signed. ID="chap0840"The constant-expression that denotes the width of the bitfield must have a value no greater than the width, in bits, of the type of the bitfield. An implementation can allocate any addressable storage unit (referred to in this discussion as simply a "unit") large enough to hold a bitfield. If an adjacent bitfield will not fit in the remainder of the unit, whether a unit is allocated for it or bitfields are allowed to span units is implementation-defined. The ordering of the bits within a unit is also implementation-defined.A bitfield with no declarator, just a colon and a width, indicates an unnamed field useful for padding. As a special case, a field with a width of zero, which cannot have a declarator, specifies alignment of the next field at the next unit boundary.These implementation-defined characteristics make the use of bitfields inherently nonportable, particularly if they are used in situationsname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'in a union, for examplename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'where the underlying object may be accessed by another data type.The first bitfield encountered in a ID="chap0841"struct is not necessarily allocated on a unit boundary and is packed into the current unit, if possible. A bitfield cannot span a unit boundary. Bits for bitfields are allocated from left (most significant) to right. In the 64-bit implementation, bitfields are packed into as small a unit as possible, where the smallest unit is 0 bytes in size and the largest unit is 8 bytes in size. The alignment requirements of the ID="chap0842"struct are influenced only by the units used to pack bitfields, not by the type of the bitfields. This is quite different from 32-bit mode, which is described next.In the 32-bit implementation, the size of a unit for bitfields is equal to the size of the type of the bitfield that started the unit. A new unit is allocated when the alignment of the type of the next bitfield differs from the alignment of the current unit, even if the number of bits in the next bitfield would fit into the current unit. For example, if the current unit has ID="chap0843"char alignment and the next bitfield has type int, then a new int-sized unit is allocated.In this implementation, for example, the following structure is two units in size:struct {
   char c;
   int k:9,
        :12;
   signed int j:5;
} s;The first unit consists of the charc in its eight bits. The alignment of an int differs from that of a char; hence, the next 24 bits are padding, followed by an int unit. The (signed)int bitfield k is in the most significant 9 bits of the int unit, followed by 12 pad bits and the 5 bits of the signed intj. The size of this struct is eight bytes.There are no arrays of bitfields. Since the address-of operator, &, cannot be applied to bitfields, there are no pointers to bitfields. ID="chap0844"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="30981"Enumeration DeclarationsEnumeration variables and constants have integral type. The syntax is:ID="chap0845"enum-specifier:enum {enum-list}enum identifier {enum-list}enum identifierenum-list:enumeratorenum-list , enumeratorenumerator:identifieridentifier = constant-expression The identifiers in an enum-list are declared as int constants and can appear wherever such constants are allowed. If no enumerators with = appear, then the values of the corresponding constants begin at 0 and increase by 1 as the declaration is read from left to right. An enumerator with = gives the associated identifier the value indicated; subsequent identifiers continue the progression from the assigned value. Note that the use of = may result in multiple enumeration constants having the same integral value, even though they are declared in the same enumeration declaration.Enumerators are in the ordinary identifiers name space (see IDREF="16739" TYPE="TITLE""Name Spaces"). Thus, an identifier used as an enumerator may conflict with identifiers used for objects, functions, and user-defined types in the same scope.The role of the identifier in the enum-specifier is entirely analogous to that of the structure tag in a struct-specifier; it names a particular enumeration. For example: enum color { chartreuse, burgundy, claret=20, winedark }; 
...
enum color *cp, col; 
...
col = claret; 
cp = &col; 
...
if (*cp == burgundy) ...  This example makes color the enumeration-tag of a type describing various colors, and then declares cp as a pointer to an object of that type and col as an object of that type. The possible values are drawn from the set {0,1,20,21}. The tags of enumeration declarations are members of the single tag name space, and thus must be distinct from tags of struct and union declarations.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="22645"Type QualifiersType qualifiers have the syntax shown below:type-qualifier: constID="chap0846"volatileID="chap0847"The same type qualifier cannot appear more than once in the same specifier list either directly or indirectly (through typedefs). The value of an object declared with the ID="chap0848"ID="chap0849"ID="chap0850"const type qualifier is constant. It cannot be modified, although it can be initialized following the same rules as the initialization of any other object. (See the discussion in IDREF="65471" TYPE="TITLE""Initialization.") Implementations are free to allocate const objects, which are not also declared volatile, in read-only storage. ID="chap0851"An object declared with the volatile type qualifier may be accessed in unknown ways or have unknown side effects. For example, a volatile object may be a special hardware register. Expressions referring to objects qualified as volatile must be evaluated strictly according to the semantics. When volatile objects are involved, an implementation is not free to perform optimizations that would otherwise be valid. At each sequence point, the value of all volatile objects must agree with that specified by the semantics.If an array is specified with type qualifiers, the qualifiers are applied to the elements of the array. If a struct or union is qualified, the qualification applies to each member.Two qualified types are compatible if they are identically qualified versions of compatible types. The order of qualifiers in a list has no effect on their semantics.The syntax of pointers allows the specification of qualifiers that affect either the pointer itself or the underlying object. Qualified pointers are covered in IDREF="47299" TYPE="TITLE""Pointer Declarators".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="17758"DeclaratorsDeclarators have the syntax shown below: declarator:pointeropt direct-declaratordirect-declarator:identifier(declarator)direct-declarator (parameter-type-listopt)direct-declarator (identifier-listopt)direct-declarator [constant-expressionopt] Portions of the list above are reproduced in the sections following, along with expansions of their constituent parts. The grouping is the same as in expressions. ID="chap0852"LBL="" HELPID=""Meaning of DeclaratorsEach declarator is an assertion that when a construction of the same form as the declarator appears in an expression, it designates a function or object with the scope, storage duration, and type indicated by the declaration.ID="chap0853"Each declarator contains exactly one identifier; it is this identifier that is declared. If, in the declarationT D1 D1 is simply an identifier, then the type of the identifier is T. If D1 has the form (D) then the underlying identifier has the type specified by the declaration T D. Thus, a declarator in parentheses is identical to the unparenthesized declarator. The binding of complex declarators can, however, be altered by parentheses. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="47299"Pointer DeclaratorsPointer declarators have the form ID="chap0854"pointer:* type-qualifier-listopt* type-qualifier-listopt pointerThe following is an example of a declaration: T D1 In this declaration, the identifier has type .. T, where the .. is empty if D1 is just a plain identifier (so that the type of x in "int x" is just int). Then if D1 has the form *type-qualifier-listoptD, the type of the contained identifier is .. (possibly-qualified) pointer to T. LBL="" HELPID=""Qualifiers and PointersIt is important to be aware of the distinction between a qualified pointer to <type> and a pointer to <qualified type>. In the declarations below, ptr_to_const is a pointer to const long. ID="chap0855"const long *ptr_to_const; 
long * const const_ptr; 
volatile int * const const_ptr_to_volatile; Thus, the long pointed to cannot be modified by the pointer. The pointer itself, however, can be altered. const_ptr can be used to modify the long that it points to, but the pointer itself cannot be modified. In the last example, const_ptr_to_volatile is a constant pointer to a volatile int and can be used to modify it. The pointer itself, however, cannot be modified. LBL="" HELPID=""Array DeclaratorsIf D1 has the form ID="chap0856"ID="chap0857"D[constant-expressionopt] then the contained identifier has type ".. array of T." The expression enclosed in square brackets, if it exists, must be an integral constant expression whose value is greater than zero. (See IDREF="19257" TYPE="TITLE""Primary Expressions".) When several "array of" specifications are adjacent, a multi-dimensional array is created; the constant expressions that specify the bounds of the arrays can be missing only for the first member of the sequence.The absence of the first array dimension is allowed if the array is external and the actual definition (which allocates storage) is given elsewhere, or if the declarator is followed by initialization. In the latter case, the size is calculated from the number of elements supplied.In order for two array types to be compatible, their element types must be compatible. In addition, if both of their size specifications are present, they must have the same value.An array can be constructed from one of the basic types, from a pointer, from a structure or union, or from another array (to generate a multi-dimensional array).The example below declares an array of float numbers and an array of pointers to float numbers:float fa[17], *afp[17]; Finally, this example declares a static three-dimensional array of integers, with rank 3x5x7. static int x3d[3][5][7]; In complete detail, x3d is an array of three items; each item is an array of five items; each of the latter items is an array of seven integers. Any of the expressions x3d, x3d[i], x3d[i][j], x3d[i][j][k] can reasonably appear in an expression. The first three have type "array" and the last has type int. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="95935"Function Declarators and PrototypesThe syntax for function declarators is shown below: ID="chap0858"ID="chap0859"ID="chap0860"direct-declarator (parameter-type-listopt)direct-declarator (identifier-listopt)parameter-type-list:parameter-listparameter-list , name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188parameter-list:parameter-declarationparameter-list , parameter-declarationparameter-declaration:declaration-specifiers declaratordeclaration-specifiers abstract-declaratoroptidentifier-list:identifieridentifier-list , identifier Function declarators cannot specify a function or array type as the return type. In addition, the only storage-class specifier that can be used in a parameter declaration is register. For example, the declaration T D1, D1 has the form:ID="chap0861"D(parameter-type-listopt) Or it has the form:D(identifier-listopt) The contained identifier has the type .. function returning T, and is possibly a prototype, as discussed below.A parameter-type-list declares the types of, and can declare identifiers for, the formal parameters of a function. The absence of a parameter-type-list indicates that no typing information is given for the function. A parameter-type-list consisting only of the keyword voidID="chap0862" indicates that the function takes zero parameters. If the parameter-type-list ends in ellipses (name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188), the function can have one or more additional arguments of variable or unknown type. (See <stdarg.h>.) ID="chap0863"The semantics of a function declarator are determined by its form and context. The possible combinations are: The declarator is not part of the function definition. The function is defined elsewhere. In this case, the declarator cannot have an identifier-list. If the parameter-type-list is absent, the declarator is an old-style function declaration. Only the return type is significant. If the parameter-type-list is present, the declarator is a function prototype. The declarator is part of the function definition:If the declarator has an identifier-list, the declarator is an old-style function definition. Only the return type is significant. If the declarator has a parameter-type-list, the definition is in prototype form. If no previous declaration for this function has been encountered, a function prototype is created for it that has file scope. If two declarations (one of which can be a definition) of the same function in the same scope are encountered, they must match, both in type of return value and in parameter-type-list. If one and only one of the declarations has a parameter-type-list, the behavior varies between ANSI C and Traditional C, as described below.In traditional C, most combinations pass without any diagnostic messages. However, an error message is emitted for cases where an incompatibility is likely to lead to a run-time failure (e.g., a ID="chap0864"float type in a parameter-type-list of a function prototype is totally incompatible with any old-style declaration for the same function; therefore, Silicon Graphics considers such redeclarations erroneous). In ANSI C, if the type of any parameter declared in the parameter-type-list is other than that which would be derived using the default argument promotions, an error is posted. Otherwise, a warning is posted and the function prototype remains in scope.In all cases, the type of the return value of duplicate declarations of the same function must match, as must the use of ellipses.When a function is invoked for which a function prototype is in scope, an attempt is made to convert each actual parameter to the type of the corresponding formal parameter specified in the function prototype, superseding the default argument promotions. In particular, floats specified in the type list are not converted to double before the call. If the list terminates with an ellipsis (...), only the parameters specified in the prototype have their types checked; additional parameters are converted according to the default argument promotions (discussed in IDREF="22645" TYPE="TITLE""Type Qualifiers"). Otherwise, the number of parameters appearing in the parameter list at the point of call must agree in number with those in the function prototype.The following are two examples of function prototypes: double foo(int *first, float second, ... ); 
int *fip(int a, long l, int (*ff)(float)); The first prototype declares a function foo(), returning a double, that has (at least) two parameters: a pointer to an int and a float. Further parameters can appear in a call of the function and are unspecified. The default argument promotions are applied to any unspecified arguments. The second prototype declares a function fip(), that returns a pointer to an int. The function fip() has three parameters: an int, a long, and a pointer to a function returning an int that has a single (float) argument. LBL="" HELPID=""Prototyped Functions SummarizedWhen a function call occurs, each argument is converted using the default argument promotions unless that argument has a type specified in a corresponding in-scope prototype for the function being called. It is easy to envision situations that may prove disastrous if some calls to a function were made with a prototype in-scope and some were not. Unexpected results can also occur if a function was called with different prototypes in-scope. Thus, if a function is prototyped, it is extremely important to make sure that all invocations of the function use the prototype.ID="chap0865"In addition to adding a new syntax for external declarations of functions, prototypes have added a new syntax for external definitions of functions. This syntax is termed function prototype form. It is highly important to define prototyped functions using a parameter-type-list rather than a simple identifier-list if the parameters are to be received as intended.In ANSI C, unless the function definition has a parameter-type-list, it is assumed that arguments have been promoted according to the default argument promotions. Specifically, an in-scope prototype for the function at the point of its definition has no effect on the type of the arguments that the function expects. In traditional C, if a function definition includes an identifier-list (that is, is not in function-prototype form) and a prototype for the function is in scope at the point of its definition, then earlier versions of the compilers merged the two so that the function prototype took precedence. Since this worked only for very simple cases, Silicon Graphics chose not to do so in this version of the C compiler. Instead, the compilers issue error diagnostics when argument-type mismatches are likely to result in faulty run-time behavior.LBL="" HELPID=""Restrictions on DeclaratorsNot all the possibilities allowed by the syntax of declarators are actually permitted. The restrictions are as follows: functions cannot return arrays or functions although they can return pointersno arrays of functions exist although arrays of pointers to functions can exista structure or union cannot contain a function, but it can contain a pointer to a function.ID="chap0866"As an example, the following declaration declares an integer i, a pointer ip to an integer, a function f returning an integer, a function fip returning a pointer to an integer, and a pointer pfi to a function, which returns an integer. int i, *ip, f(), *fip(), (*pfi)(); It is especially useful to compare the last two. The binding of *fip() is *(pfi()). The declaration suggests, and the same construction in an expression requires, the calling of a function fip, and then using indirection through the (pointer) result to yield an integer. In the declarator (*pfi)(), the extra parentheses are necessary, as they are also in an expression, to indicate that indirection through a pointer to a function yields a function, which is then called; it returns an integer.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="13939"Type NamesIn several contexts (for example, to specify type conversions explicitly by means of a cast, in a function prototype, and as an argument of sizeofID="chap0867"), it is best to supply the name of a data type. This naming is accomplished using a "type name," whose syntax is a declaration for an object of that type without the identifier. The syntax for type names is shown below:ID="chap0868"type-name:specifier-qualifier-list abstract-declaratoroptabstract-declarator:pointerpointeropt direct-abstract-declaratordirect-abstract-declarator:(abstract-declarator)direct-abstract-declaratoropt [constant-expressionopt]direct-abstract-declaratoropt (parameter-type-listopt)The type-name created can be used as a synonym for the type that the omitted identifier would have. The syntax indicates that a set of empty parentheses in a type name is interpreted as function with no parameter information rather than as redundant parentheses surrounding the (omitted) identifier.

for which no parameter type information is givenLBL="" HELPID=""Implicit DeclarationsIt is not always necessary to specify both the storage class and the type of identifiers in a declaration. The storage class is supplied by the context in external definitions, and in declarations of formal parameters and structure members. Missing storage class specifiers appearing in declarations outside of functions are assumed to be ID="chap0869"extern (see IDREF="26015" TYPE="TITLE""External Name Changes" for details). Missing type specifiers in this context are assumed to be int. In a declaration inside a function, if a type but no storage class is indicated, the identifier is assumed to be auto. An exception to the latter rule is made for functions because auto functions do not exist. If the type of an identifier is function returning <type>, it is implicitly declared to be extern. In an expression, an identifier followed by a left parenthesis (indicating a function call) that is not already declared, is implicitly declared to be of type function returning int. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="18668"typedefDeclarations with the storage class specifier typedef do not define storage. A typedef has the syntax shown below:typedef-name:ID="chap0870"identifier Rather than becoming an object with the given type, an identifier appearing in a typedef declaration becomes a synonym for the type. For example:int intarray[10]; If, in the above example, the int type specifier were preceded with typedef, the identifier declared as an object would instead be declared as a synonym for the array type. This can appear as shown below:typedef int intarray[10]; This example could be used as if it were a basic type. For example: intarray ia;After typedef int MILES, *KLICKSP; 
typedef struct { 
double re, im; 
} 
complex; the constructions MILES distance; 
extern KLICKSP metricp; 
complex z, *zp; are all legal declarations. The type of distance is int, that of metricp is pointer to int, and that of z is the specified structure. The zp is a pointer to such a structure.The typedef does not introduce brand-new types, only synonyms for types that could be specified in another way. Thus, in the example above, distance is considered to have exactly the same type as any other int object. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="65471"InitializationA declaration of an object or of an array of unknown size can specify an initial value for the identifier being declared. The initializer is preceded by ID="chap0871"=  and consists of an expression or a list of values enclosed in nested braces.initializer:assignment-expression{initializer-list}{initializer-list ,}initializer-list:initializerinitializer-list , initializer There cannot be more initializers than there are objects to be initialized. All the expressions in an initializer for an object of static storage duration must be constant expressions (see IDREF="19257" TYPE="TITLE""Primary Expressions".) Objects with automatic storage duration can be initialized by arbitrary expressions involving constants and previously declared variables and functions, except for aggregate initialization, which can only include constant expressions.Identifiers declared with block scope and either external or internal linkage (that is, objects declared in a function with the storage-class specifier extern) cannot be initialized. Variables of static storage duration that are not explicitly initialized are implicitly initialized to zero. The value of automatic and register variables that are not explicitly initialized is undefined. When an initializer applies to a scalar (a pointer or an object of arithmetic type; see IDREF="54350" TYPE="TITLE""Derived Types"), it consists of a single expression, perhaps in braces. The initial value of the object is taken from the expression. With the exception of type qualifiers associated with the scalar, which are ignored during the initialization, the same conversions as for assignment are performed.LBL="" HELPID=""Initialization of AggregatesIn traditional C it is illegal to initialize a ID="chap0872"ID="chap0873"union. It is also illegal to initialize a ID="chap0874"struct of automatic storage duration. In ANSI C, objects that are struct or union types can be initialized, even if they have automatic storage duration. unions are initialized using the type of the first named element in their declaration. The initializers used for a struct or union of automatic storage duration must be constant expressions.When the declared variable is a struct or array, the initializer consists of a brace-enclosed, comma-separated list of initializers for the members of the aggregate written in increasing subscript or member order. If the aggregate contains subaggregates, this rule applies recursively to the members of the aggregate. If the initializer of a subaggregate or union begins with a left brace, its initializers consist of all the initializers found between the left brace and the matching right brace. If, however, the initializer does not begin with a left brace, then only enough elements from the list are taken to account for the members of the subaggregate; any remaining members are left to initialize the next member of the aggregate of which the current subaggregate is a part.Within any brace-enclosed list, there should not be more initializers than members. If fewer initializers occur in the list than there are members of the aggregate, then the aggregate is padded with zeros.Unnamed struct or union members are ignored during initialization.In ANSI C, if the variable is a union, the initializer consists of a brace-enclosed initializer for the first member of the union. Initialization of struct or union objects with automatic storage duration can be abbreviated as a simple assignment of a compatible struct or union object.A final abbreviation allows a char array to be initialized by a string literal. In this case successive characters of the string literal initialize the members of the array.In ANSI C, an array of wide characters (that is, whose element type is compatible with wchar_t) can be initialized with a wide string literal (see IDREF="33247" TYPE="TITLE""String Literals"). ID="chap0875"LBL="" HELPID=""Examples of InitializationFor example, ID="chap0876"int x[] = { 1, 3, 5 }; declares and initializes x as a one-dimensional array that has three members, since no size was specified and there are three initializers. float y[4][3] = 
{
 { 1, 3, 5 },
 { 2, 4, 6 },
 { 3, 5, 7 }, 
}; is a completely bracketed initialization: 1, 3, and 5 initialize the first row of the array y[0], namely y[0][0], y[0][1], and y[0][2]. Likewise, the next two lines initialize y[1] and y[2]. The initializer ends early, and therefore y[3] is initialized with 0. The next example achieves precisely the same effect.float y[4][3] = 
{
 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7 
}; The initializer for y begins with a left brace but that for y[0] does not; therefore, three elements from the list are used. Likewise, the next three are taken successively for y[1] and y[2]. Also, float y[4][3] = { { 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4 } 
}; initializes the first column of y (regarded as a two-dimensional array) and leaves the rest 0.The following example demonstrates the ANSI C rules. A union object union dc_u {

A special case is the null statement, which consists of only a semicolon.   ID="chap093"ID="chap094"LBL="" HELPID=""Compound Statement or BlockA compound statement (or block) groups a set of statements into a syntactic unit. The set can have its own declarations and initializers, and has the form:ID="chap095"compound-statement:       {declaration-list opt  statement-list opt} declaration-list:        declaration        declaration-list declaration statement-list:        statement        statement-list statement Declarations within compound statements have block scope. If any of the identifiers in the declaration-list were previously declared, the outer declaration is hidden for the duration of the block, after which it resumes its force. In traditional C, however, function declarations always have ID="chap096"ID="chap097"file scope whenever they appear.Initialization of identifiers declared within the block is restricted to those that have no linkage. Thus, the initialization of an identifier declared within the block using the extern specifier is not allowed. These initializations are performed only once, prior to the first entry into the block, for identifiers with static storage duration. For identifiers with automatic storage duration, it is performed each time the block is entered at the top. It is currently possible (but a bad practice) to transfer into a block; in that case, no initializations are performed.

ID="chap0912"ID="chap0913"LBL="" HELPID=""The if StatementThe controlling expression of an ID="chap0914"if statement must have scalar type. ID="chap0915"For both forms of the if statement, the first statement is executed if the controlling expression evaluates to nonzero. For the second form, the second statement is executed if the controlling expression evaluates to zero. An else clause that follows multiple sequential else-less if statements is associated with the most recent if statement in the same block (that is, not in an enclosed block). ID="chap0916"LBL="" HELPID=""The switch Statement The controlling expression of a switch statement must have integral type. The statement is typically a compound statement, some of whose constituent statements are labeled case statements (see IDREF="60638" TYPE="TITLE""Labeled Statements"). In addition, at most one labeled default statement can occur in a switch. The expression on each case label must be an integral constant expression. No two expressions on case labels in the same switch can evaluate to the same constant.   ID="chap0917"ID="chap0918"ID="chap0919"ID="chap0920"ID="chap0921"A compound statement attached to a switch can include declarations. Due to the flow of control in a switch, however, initialization of identifiers so declared are not performed if these initializers have automatic storage duration.The integral promotions are performed on the controlling expression, and the constant expression of each case statement is converted to the promoted type. Control is transferred to the labeled case statement whose expression value matches the value of the controlling expression. If no such match occurs, control is transferred either past the end of the switch or to the labeled default statement, if one exists in the switch. Execution continues sequentially once control has been transferred. In particular, the flow of control is not altered upon encountering another ID="chap0922"case label. The switch statement is exited, however, upon encountering a break or continue statement (see IDREF="58788" TYPE="TITLE""The break Statement" and IDREF="61959" TYPE="TITLE""The continue Statement", respectively).

The scope of such a label is the current function. Thus, labels must be unique within a function. In traditional C, identifiers used as labels and in object declarations share a name space. Thus, use of an identifier as a label hides any declaration of that identifier in an enclosing scope.

No complex instructions exist (for example, read-modify-write). volatile objects appearing on the left side of an assignment expression are accessed once for the write. If the assignment is not simple, an additional read access is performed. volatile objects appearing in other contexts are accessed once per instance. Incrementation and decrementation require both a read and a write access.volatile objects that are memory-mapped are accessed only as specified: if such an object is of size char, for example, adjacent bytes are not accessed. If the object is a bitfield, a read may access the entire storage unit containing the field.

The behavior on each recognized #pragma directive.#pragma weak weak_symbol = strong_symbolThe ID="apenA87"weak_symbol is an alias that denotes the same function or data object denoted by the strong_symbol, unless a defining declaration for the weak_symbol is encountered at static link time. If encountered, the defining declaration preempts the weak denotation. You must define the strong_symbol within the same compilation unit in which the pragma occurs. You should also declare the weak_symbol with extern linkage in the same compilation unit. The extern declaration of the weak symbol is not required, unless the symbol is referenced within the compilation unit, but Silicon Graphics recommends it for type-checking purposes. The weak and strong symbols must be declared with compatible types. When the strong symbol is a data object, its declaration must be initialized. Weak ID="apenA88"extern declarations are typically used to export non-ANSI C symbols from a library without polluting the ANSI C name-space. As an example, libc may export a weak symbol read(), which aliases a strong symbol _read(), where _read() is used in the implementation of the exported symbol fread(). You can either use the exported (weak) version of read(), or define your own version of read() thereby preempting the weak denotation of this symbol. This will not alter the definition of fread(), since it only depends on the (strong) symbol _read(), which is outside the ANSI C name-space.#pragma weak weak_symbolThe pragma weak weak_symbol tells the link editor not to complain if it does not find a defining declaration of the weak_symbol. References to the symbol use the appropriate lvalue if the symbol is defined; otherwise, it uses memory location zero (0).#pragmaonceThis pragma has no effect in ID="apenA89"­32 mode, but will ensure idempotent include files in ­64 mode (i.e. that an include file is included at most once in one compilation unit). Silicon Graphics recommends enclosing the contents of an include file afile.h with an #ifdef directive similar to:#ifndef afile_INCLUDED
#define afile_INCLUDED
<contents of afile.h>
#endif#pragma pack(n)This pragma controls the layout of structure offsets, such that the strictest alignment for any structure member will be ID="apenA90"n bytes, where n is 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. When n is 0, the compiler returns to default alignment for any subsequent struct definitions. A struct type defined in the scope of a #pragma pack(n) has at most an alignment of n bytes, and the packed characteristics of the type apply wherever the type is used, even outside the scope of the pragma in which the type was declared. The scope of a #pragma pack ends with the next #pragma pack, hence this pragma does not nest: There is no way to "return" from one instance of the pragma to a lexically earlier instance of the pragma. A structure declaration must be subjected to identical instances of a #pragma pack in all files, or else misaligned memory accesses and erroneous struct member dereferencing may ensue. Silicon Graphics strongly discourages the use of #pragma pack, since it is a nonportable feature, may result in less efficient field dereferencing, and it may not be supported in future compiler releases. #pragma intrinsic(a_function)This pragma allows certain preselected functions from ID="apenA91"math.h, stdio.h, and string.h to be inlined at a call-site for execution efficiency. The #pragma intrinsic has no effect on functions other than the preselected ones. Exactly which functions may be inlined, how they are inlined, and under what circumstances inlining occurs is implementation defined and may vary from one release of the compilers to the next. The inlining of intrinsics may violate some aspect of the ANSI C standard (e.g., the errno setting for math.h functions). All intrinsics are activated through pragmas in the respective standard header files and only when the preprocessor symbol __INLINE_INTRINSICS is defined and the appropriate include files are included. __INLINE_INTRINSICS is predefined by default only in ­cckr and ­xansi mode.The MIPSpro compilers also silently recognize many commonly used pragmas; however, they have no effect. Some of these include: ID="apenA92"#pragma no side effect(a_function)Tells the compiler that a call to a function of the given name does not cause any modifications to objects accessible outside the function body. Such information can be useful for optimization and parallelization purposes. In ID="apenA93"­64 mode, the syntax for this pragma is changed to #pragma no_side_effect(a_function).#pragmaident versionAdds a ID="apenA94".comment section in the object file and puts the revision string inside it. #pragmaint_to_unsigned identifierIdentifies ID="apenA95"identifier as a function whose type was int in a previous releases of the compilation system, but whose type is unsigned int in the MIPSpro compiler release. The declaration of the identifier must precede the pragma:unsigned int strlen(const char*);
#pragma int_to_unsigned strlenThis declaration makes it possible for the compiler to identify where the changed type may affect the evaluation of expressions.Other #pragmas are used for C multiprocessing.

In the ID="apenA124"signal invocation signal(sig, func), func can be the address of a signal handler, handler, or one of the two constant values (defined in <sys/signal.h>) SIG_DFL or SIG_IGN. The semantics of these values are:SIG_DFLterminate process upon receipt of signal sig(This is the default if no call to signal for signal sig occurs.) Upon receipt of the signal sig, the receiving process is to be terminated with all of the consequences outlined in exit(2). See note 1 under IDREF="35744" TYPE="TITLE""Signal Notes".SIG_IGNignore signal The signal sig is to be ignored. handler catch signalfunc is the address of function handler.Note
The signals SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, and SIGCONT cannot be ignored.If func is the address of handler, upon receipt of the signal sig, the receiving process is to invoke handler as follows:handler (int sig, int code, struct sigcontext *sc);The remaining arguments are supplied as extensions and are optional.

Upon return from handler, the receiving process resumes execution at the point that it was interrupted. Before entering the signal-catching function, the value of func for the caught signal is set to SIG_DFL, unless the signal is SIGILL, SIGTRAP, or SIGPWR. This means that before exiting the handler, a call to signal is necessary to catch future signals. Suppose a signal that is to be caught occurs during:a read(2), a write(2), an open(2)an ioctl(2) system call on a slow device (like a terminal; but not a file)a pause(2) system calla wait(2) system call that does not return immediately due to the existence of a previously stopped or zombie processThe signal catching function is executed and then the interrupted system call returns a ­1 to the calling process with errno set to EINTR. ID="apenA125"Note
The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="35744"Signal NotesIf SIG_DFL is assigned for SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGABRT, SIGEMT, SIGFPE, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, or SIGSYS, in addition to the process being terminated, a "core image" is constructed in the current working directory of the process, if the following conditions are met:The effective user ID and the real user ID of the receiving process are equal. An ordinary file named core exists and is writable or can be created. If the file must be created, it has the following properties:a mode of 0666 modified by the file creation mask [see umask(2)]a file owner ID that is the same as the effective user ID of the receiving processa file group ID that is the same as the effective group ID of the receiving processNote
The core file can be truncated if the resultant file size would exceed either ulimit [see ulimit(2)] or the process's maximum core file size [see setrlimit(2)].For the signals SIGCLD, SIGWINCH, SIGPWR, SIGURG, and SIGIO, the actions associated with each of the three possible values for func are:SIG_DFLignore signal The signal is to be ignored.SIG_IGNignore signal The signal is to be ignored. Also, if sig is SIGCLD, the calling process's child processes do not create zombie processes when they terminate [see exit(2)].handlercatch signal If the signal is SIGPWR, SIGURG, SIGIO, or SIGWINCH, the action to be taken is the same as that described above when func is the address of a function. The same is true if the signal is SIGCLD with one exception: while the process is executing the signal-catching function, all terminating child processes are queued. The wait system call removes the first entry of the queue. If the signal system call is used to catch SIGCLD, the signal handler must be reattached when exiting the handler, and at that timename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'if the queue is not emptyname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'SIGCLD is raised again before signal returns. See wait(2).In addition, SIGCLD affects the wait and exit system calls as follows:waitIf the handler parameter of SIGCLD is set to SIG_IGN and a wait is executed, the wait blocks until all of the calling process's child processes terminate; it then returns a value of -1 with errno set to ECHILD.exitIf in the exiting process's parent process the handler parameter of SIGCLD is set to SIG_IGN, the exiting process does not create a zombie process.When processing a pipeline, the shell makes the last process in the pipeline the parent of the preceding processes. A process that can be piped into in this manner (and thus become the parent of other processes) should take care not to set SIGCLD to be caught.SIGPOLL is issued when a file descriptor corresponding to a STREAMS [see intro(2)] file has a "selectable" event pending. A process must specifically request that this signal be sent using the I_SETSIG ioctl call. Otherwise, the process never receives SIGPOLL.SIGEMT is never generated on an IRIS 4D system.SIGTRAP is generated for breakpoint instructions, overflows, divide by zeros, range errors, and multiply overflows. The second argument code gives specific details of the cause of the signal. Possible values are described in <sys/signal.h>.The signals SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGCONT are used by command interpreters like the C shell [see csh(1)] to provide job control. The first four signals listed stop the receiving process unless the signal is caught or ignored. SIGCONT resumes a stopped process. SIGTSTP is sent from the terminal driver in response to the SWTCH character being entered from the keyboard [see termio(7)]. SIGTTIN is sent from the terminal driver when a background process attempts to read from its controlling terminal. If SIGTTIN is ignored by the process, then the read returns EIO. SIGTTOU is sent from the terminal driver when a background process attempts to write to its controlling terminal when the terminal is in TOSTOP mode. If SIGTTOU is ignored by the process, then the write succeeds, regardless of the state of the controlling terminal.Signal does not catch an invalid function argument, func, and results are undefined when an attempt is made to execute the function at the bad address.SIGKILL immediately terminates a process, regardless of its state.Processes stopped via job control (typically <Ctrl>-Z) do not act upon any delivered signals other than SIGKILL until the job is restarted. Processes blocked via a blockproc(2) system call unblock if they receive a signal that is fatal (that is, a non-job-control signal that they are not catching). These processes remained stopped, however, if the job they are a part of is stopped. Only upon restart do they die. Any non-fatal signals received by a blocked process do not cause the process to be unblocked. An unblockproc(2) or unblockprocall(2) system call is necessary.If an instance of signal sig is pending when signal(sig,func) is executed, the pending signal is cancelled unless it is SIGKILL.signal() fails if sig is an illegal signal number, including SIGKILL and SIGSTOP, or if an illegal operation is requested (such as ignoring SIGCONT, which is ignored by default). In these cases, signal() returns SIG_ERR and sets errno to EINVAL.After a fork(2), the child inherits all handlers and signal masks. If any signals are pending for the parent, they are not inherited by the child.The exec(2) routines reset all caught signals to the default action; ignored signals remain ignored; the blocked signal mask is unchanged and pending signals remain pending.These man pages contain other relevant information: intro(2), blockproc(2), kill(2), pause(2), ptrace(2), sigaction(2), sigset(2), wait(2), setjmp(3C), sigvec(3B), and kill(1). LBL="" HELPID=""DiagnosticsUpon successful completion, signal returns the previous value of func for the specified signal sig.

However, subsequent processes/programs reading the text stream or file might expect the newline to be present; it customarily is in IRIX text files. Whether space characters that are written out to a text stream immediately before a newline character appear when read in (4.9.2).All text characters (including spaces before a newline character) written out to a text stream appear exactly as written when read back in. The number of null characters that can be appended to data written to a binary stream (4.9.2). The library never appends nulls to data written to a binary stream. Only the characters written by the application are written to the output stream, whether binary or text. Text and binary streams are identical: there is no distinction. ID="apenA130"ID="apenA131"Whether the file position indicator of an append mode stream is initially positioned at the beginning or end of the file (4.9.2).The file position indicator of an append stream is initially positioned at the end of the file. ID="apenA132"ID="apenA133"Whether a write on a text stream causes the associated file to be truncated beyond that point (4.9.3). A write on a text stream does not cause the associated file to be truncated. ID="apenA134"The characteristics of file buffering (4.9.3).Files are fully buffered, as described in paragraph 3, section 4.9.3, of ANSI X3.159-1989.ID="apenA135"Whether a zero-length file actually exists (4.9.3). Zero-length files exist, but have no data, so a read on such a file gets an immediate EOF. ID="apenA136"ID="apenA137"The rules for composing valid file names (4.9.3). Filenames consist of 1 to FILENAME_MAX characters. These characters can be selected from the set of all character values excluding \0 (null) and the ASCII code for / (slash).ID="apenA138"ID="apenA139"ID="apenA140"Note that it is generally unwise to use *, ?, [, or ] as part of file names because of the special meaning attached to these characters by the shell (see sh(1)). Although permitted, the use of unprintable characters should be avoided.Whether the same file can be opened multiple times (4.9.3). A file can be open any number of times. ID="apenA141"The effect of the remove function on an open file (4.9.4.1). For local disk files, a remove removes a directory entry pointing to the file but has no effect on the file or the program with the file open. For files remotely mounted via NFS software, the effect is unpredictable (the file might be removed making further I/O impossible through open streams, or it might behave like a local disk file) and might depend on the version(s) of NFS involved. ID="apenA142"ID="apenA143"The effect if a file with the new name exists prior to a call to the rename function (4.9.4.2). If the new name exists, the file with that new name is removed (See rm(1)) before the rename is done. ID="apenA144"ID="apenA145"ID="apenA146"The output for %p conversion in the ID="apenA147"fprintf function (4.9.6.1). %p is treated the same as %x. The input for %p conversion in the ID="apenA148"fscanf function (4.9.6.2). %p is treated the same as %x. The interpretation of a ­ character that is neither the first nor the last character in the scanlist for %[ conversion in the fscanf function (4.9.6.2).A ­ character that does not fit the pattern mentioned above is used as a shorthand for ranges of characters. For example, [xabcdefgh] and [xa-h] mean that characters a through h and the character x are in the range (called a scanset in 4.9.6.2). ID="apenA149"LBL="" HELPID=""Temporary FilesWhether a temporary file is removed if a program terminates abnormally (4.9.4.3). Temporary files are removed if a program terminates abnormally. ID="apenA150"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="71777"errno and perrorThe value to which the macro errno is set by the fgetpos or ftell function on failure (4.9.9.1, 4.9.9.4). errno is set to EBADF (9) by the ID="apenA151"ID="apenA152"ID="apenA153"fgetpos or ftell function on failure. The messages generated by theID="apenA154"perror function (4.9.10.4). The message generated is simply a string.

LBL="" HELPID=""Memory Allocation The behavior of the ID="apenA155"calloc, ID="apenA156"malloc, or ID="apenA157"realloc function if the size requested is zero (4.10.3). The malloc in libc.a returns a pointer to a zero-length space if a size of zero is requested. Successive calls to malloc return different zero-length pointers. If the library libmalloc.a is used, ID="apenA158"malloc returns 0 (the NULL pointer). LBL="" HELPID=""The abort FunctionThe behavior of the abort function with regard to open and temporary files (4.10.4.1). Open files are not flushed, but are closed. Temporary files are removed. ID="apenA159"ID="apenA160"ID="apenA161"LBL="" HELPID=""The exit FunctionThe status returned by the ID="apenA162"exit function if the value of the argument is other than zero, EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE (4.10.4.3). The status returned to the environment is the least significant eight bits of the value passed to exit. LBL="" HELPID=""The getenv FunctionThe set of environment names and the method for altering the environment list used by the getenv function (4.10.4.4). Any string can be used as the name of an environment variable, and any string can be used for its value. The function ID="apenA163"ID="apenA164"ID="apenA165"ID="apenA166"putenv alters the environment list of the application. For example,putenv("MYNAME=foo")This sets the value of the environment variable MYNAME to "foo." If the environment variable MYNAME already existed, its value is changed. If it did not exist, it is added. The string passed to putenv actually becomes part of the environment, and changing it later alters the environment. Further, the string should not be space that was automatically allocated (for example, an auto array); rather, it should be space that is either global or malloced. For more information, see the putenv(3C) man page. It is not wise to alter the value of well-known environment variables. For the current list, see the man page for environ(3c).LBL="" HELPID=""The system FunctionThe contents and mode of execution of the string passed to the ID="apenA167"system function (4.10.4.5). The contents of the string should be a command string, as if typed to a normal IRIX shell, such as sh(1). A shell (sh(1)) is forked, and the string is passed to it. The current process waits until the shell has completed and returns the exit status of the shell as the return value. LBL="" HELPID=""The strerror FunctionThe contents of the error message strings returned by the strerror function (4.11.6.2). The string is exactly the same as the string output by perror, which is documented in IDREF="71777" TYPE="TITLE""errno and perror".LBL="" HELPID=""Timezones and the clock Function. The local time zone and daylight saving time (4.12.1). Local time and daylight saving time are determined by the value of the ID="apenA168"ID="apenA169"ID="apenA170"ID="apenA171"TZ environment variable. TZ is set by init(1) to the default value indicated in the file /etc/TIMEZONE, and this value is inherited in the environment of all processes. If TZ is unset, the local time zone defaults to GMT (Greenwich mean time, or coordinated universal time), and daylight saving time is not in effect. See the man pages ctime(3C), time(2), timezone(4), environ(5), getenv(3), and other related man pages for the format of TZ. The era for the clock function (4.12.2.1). clockID="apenA172" counts seconds from 00:00:00: GMT, January 1, 1970. What was once known as Greenwich mean time (GMT) is now known as coordinated universal time, though the man pages do not reflect this change yet. See the ctime(3C) man page for further information. LBL="" HELPID=""Locale-Specific Behavior (F.4)For information on locale-specific behavior, refer to the X/Open Portability Guide, Volume 3, "XSI Supplementary Definitions," published by Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632, ISBN 0-13-685-850-3.LBL="" HELPID=""Common Extensions (F.5)The following extensions are widely used in many systems, but are not portable to all implementations. The inclusion of any extension that can cause a strictly conforming program to become invalid renders an implementation nonconforming. Examples of such extensions are new keywords, or library functions declared in standard headers or predefined macros with names that do not begin with an underscore. The Standard's description of each extension is followed by a definition of any Silicon Graphics support/nonsupport of each common extension. LBL="" HELPID=""Environment Arguments (F.5.1)In a hosted environment, the main function receives a third argument, char *envp[], that points to a null-terminated array of pointers to char. Each of these pointers points to a string that provides information about the environment for this execution of the process (2.1.2.1.1). This extension is supported. LBL="" HELPID=""Specialized IdentifiersCharacters other than the underscore _, letters, and digits, that are not defined in the required source character set (such as dollar sign $, or characters in national character sets) can appear in an identifier. If the ­dollar option is given to cc, then the dollar sign ($) is allowed in identifiers. LBL="" HELPID=""Lengths and Cases of IdentifiersAll characters in identifiers (with or without external linkage) are significant and case distinctions are observed (3.1.2). All characters are significant. Case distinctions are observed. LBL="" HELPID=""Scopes of Identifiers (F.5.4)A function identifier, or the identifier of an object (the declaration of which contains the keyword extern) has file scope.This is true of the compiler when invoked with cc ­cckr (that is, when requesting traditional C). When compiling in ANSI mode (by default or with one of the ANSI options) function identifiers (and all other identifiers) have block scope when declared at block level. LBL="" HELPID=""Writable String Literals (F.5.5)String literals are modifiable. Identical string literals shall be distinct (3.1.4). All string literals are distinct and writable when theID="apenA173" ­use_readwrite_const option is in effect. Otherwise, string literals may not be writable. LBL="" HELPID=""Other Arithmetic Types (F.5.6)Other arithmetic types, such as long long int and their appropriate conversions, are defined (3.2.2.1). Yes. LBL="" HELPID=""Function Pointer Casts (F.5.7)A pointer to an object or to void can be cast to a pointer to a function, allowing data to be invoked as a function (3.3.4). A pointer to a function can be cast to a pointer to an object, or to void, allowing a function to be inspected or modified (for example, by a debugger) (3.3.4).Function pointers can be cast to a pointer to an object, or to void, and vice versa.ID="apenA174"Data can be invoked as a function.Casting a pointer to a function to a pointer to an object or void does allow a function to be inspected. Normally, functions cannot be written to, since text space is read-only. Dynamically loaded functions are loaded (by a user program) into data space and can be written to. ID="apenA175"LBL="" HELPID=""Non-int Bit-Field Types (F.5.8)Types other than int, unsigned int, and signed int can be declared as bitfields, with appropriate maximum widths (3.5.2.1). A bitfield can be any integral type in ID="apenA176"­xansi and ­cckr modes. However, bitfields of types other than int, signed int, and unsigned int result in a warning diagnostic in ­ansi mode. LBL="" HELPID=""The fortran Keyword (F.5.9)The fortran declaration specifier can be used in a function declaration to indicate that calls suitable for Fortran should be generated, or that different representations for external names are to be generated (3.5.4.3).The fortran keyword is not supported in this ANSI C. With cc ­cckr, that keyword is accepted but ignored. LBL="" HELPID=""The asm Keyword (F.5.10)The asm keyword can be used to insert assembly language code directly into the translator output. The most common implementation is via statement of the form asm (character-string-literal) (3.6).The asm keyword is not supported. LBL="" HELPID=""Multiple External Definitions (F.5.11)There can be more than one external definition for the identifier of an object, with or without the explicit use of the keyword extern. If the definitions disagree, or more than one is initialized, the behavior is undefined (3.7.2).With ANSI C, only one external definition of the object is permitted. If more than one is present, the linker (ld(1) gives a warning message. The Strict Ref/Def model is followed (ANSI C Rationale, 3.1.2.2, page 23).With cc ­cckr, the Relaxed Ref/Def model is followed (ANSI C Rationale, 3.1.2.2, page 23): multiple definitions of the same identifier of an object in different files are accepted and all but one of the definitions are treated (silently) as if they had the extern keyword.If the definitions in different source units disagree, the mismatch is not currently detected by the linker (ld), and the resulting program will probably not work correctly. LBL="" HELPID=""Empty Macro Arguments (F.5.12)A macro argument can consist of no preprocessing tokens (3.8.3). This extension is supported. For example, one could define a macro such as #define notokargs() macrovalueLBL="" HELPID=""Predefined Macro Names (F.5.13)Macro names that do not begin with an underscore, describing the translation and execution environments, may be defined by the implementation before translation begins (3.8.8).This is not true for cc -ansi, which defines ANSI C. Only macro names beginning with two underscores or a single underscore followed by a capital letter are predefined by the implementation before translation begins. The name space is not polluted.With cc ­cckr (traditional C), a C preprocessor is used with a full set of the predefined symbols. For example, sgi is predefined.With cc ­xansi (which is the default for cc), an ANSI C preprocessor and compiler are used and a full set of predefined symbols is defined (including sgi, for example). LBL="" HELPID=""Extra Arguments for Signal Handlers (F.5.14)Handlers for specific signals can be called with extra arguments in addition to the signal number.Silicon Graphics supports System V, POSIX, and BSD signal handlers. Extra arguments to the handler are available for your use. See the signal man page.LBL="" HELPID=""Additional Stream Types and File-Opening Modes (F.5.15)Additional mappings from files to streams may be supported (4.9.2), and additional file-opening modes may be specified by characters appended to the mode argument of the fopen function (4.9.5.3).There are no additional modes supported. There are no additional mappings. The UNIX approach is used, as mentioned in the ANSI C Rationale, Section 4.9.2, page 90. LBL="" HELPID=""Defined File Position Indicator (F.5.16)The file position indicator is decremented by each successful call to the ungetc function for a text stream, except if its value was zero before a call (4.9.7.11).Only the one character of pushback guaranteed by the standard is supported.postfixIDREF="chap0766"Prefix ++ and ­ ­ Operators! operatorIDREF="chap0763"Unary ! and ~ Operators!=
