It describes the digital media data types and explains how to use the digital media parameters.LBL="" HELPID=""Digital Media Library BasicsIt is not likely that you'll use the DM Library by itself. Typically, you call DM Library routines from an application that is written using one or more of the IRIS digital media libraries. Currently, you can use the DM routines with the Movie Library and the Video Library.ID="Media1-2DM2"ID="Media1-2DM3"The DM Library features:ID="Media1-2DM4"type definitions for digital mediaroutines for creating and configuring digital media parametersroutines for creating and configuring digital media ring buffersa debugging version of the library that lets you check for proper usageLBL="" HELPID=""Digital Media Type DefinitionsThe DM Library provides type definitions for digital media. Data types and constant names have an uppercase DM prefix; routines have a lowercase dm prefix.The ID="Media1-2DM5"dmedia/dmedia.h header file provides these type definitions:ID="Media1-2DM6"ID="Media1-2DM7"DMbooleaninteger for conditionals; DM_FALSE is 0 and DM_TRUE is 1DMfractioninteger numerator divided by integer denominatorDMstatusenumerated type consisting of DM_SUCCESS and DM_FAILUREIDREF="10264" TYPE="TABLE"Table 2-1 lists the digital media parameter type definitions that are defined in ID="Media1-2DM8"ID="Media1-2DM9"dmedia/dm_params.h.COLUMNS="2"LBL="2-1"Table 2-1 ID="10264"Digital Media Parameter TypesLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"Parameter TypeLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"MeaningLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_ENUMLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Enumerated typeLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_ENUM_ARRAYLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Array of enumerated typesLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_INTLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Integer valueLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_INT_ARRAYLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Array of integersLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_INT_RANGELEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Range of integersLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_STRINGLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"StringLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_STRING_ARRAYLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Array of stringsLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_FLOATLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Floating point valueLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_FLOAT_ARRAYLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Array of floatsLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_FLOAT_RANGELEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Range of floatsLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_FRACTIONLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"RatioLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_FRACTION_ARRAYLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Array of fractionsLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_FRACTION_RANGELEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Range of fractionsLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_PARAMSLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Parameter-value listLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"DM_TYPE_TOC_ENTRYLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Table-of-contents entry for ring buffersLBL="" HELPID=""Digital Media ParametersParameter-value lists are used to store configuration information for movies, movie tracks, ring buffers, and video paths. A parameter-value list is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the name of a parameter and the corresponding value for that parameter.ID="Media1-2DM10"Typical ways in which you might use a parameter-value list include:passing a parameter-value list to a routine that configures a structure passing a parameter-value list that contains new parameter settings to a routine that changes the settingsusing convenience routines provided by one of the IRIS digital media libraries to set and get parameter values that apply to that libraryEvery parameter-value list that describes a format includes the parameter DM_MEDIUM to indicate what kind of data it describes. DM_MEDIUM is an enumerated type consisting of DM_IMAGE and DM_AUDIO.ID="Media1-2DM11"ID="Media1-2DM12"The routines described in this chapter follow the general rule that ownership of data is not passed during procedure calls, except in the routines that create and destroy parameter-value lists. Functions that take strings copy the strings if they want to keep them. Functions that return strings or other structures retain ownership and the caller must not free them.LBL="" HELPID=""Compiling and Linking a Digital Media Library ApplicationApplications that call DM Library routines must include the ID="Media1-2DM13"libdmedia header files to obtain definitions for the library; however, these files are usually included in the header file of the library you are using.This code fragment includes all the ID="Media1-2DM14"libdmedia header files:#include <dmedia/dmedia.h>
#include <dmedia/dm_audio.h>
#include <dmedia/dm_image.h>
#include <dmedia/dm_params.h>
ID="Media1-2DM15"ID="Media1-2DM16"ID="Media1-2DM17"ID="Media1-2DM18"Link with the DM Library when compiling an application that makes DM Library calls by including ID="Media1-2DM19"ID="Media1-2DM20"-ldmedia on the link line. It's likely that you'll be linking with other libraries as well, and because the linking order is usually specific, follow the linking instructions for the library you are using.LBL="" HELPID=""Debugging a Digital Media Library ApplicationThe debugging version of the DM Library checks for library usage violations by setting assertions that state the requirements for a parameter or value.ID="Media1-2DM21"To debug your DM application, link with the debugging version of the DM Library, libdmedia_d.so, by using ID="Media1-2DM22"-ldmedia_d instead of -ldmedia, and then run your program. Your application will abort with an error message if it fails an assertion. The message explains the situation that caused the error and, by implication or by explicit description, suggests a corrective action.When you have finished debugging your application, you should relink with the nondebugging library, libdmedia.a, because the runtime checks imposed by the debugging library cause an undesirable size and performance overhead for a packaged application.LBL="" HELPID=""Initializing a Digital Media ApplicationThis section explains how to use the DM Library routines for:ID="Media1-2DM23"ID="Media1-2DM24"creating and destroying parameter-value listscreating default audio and image configurationssetting and getting values in parameter-value listsmanipulating parameter-value listsIn the initialization section of your application, you create and use parameter-value lists to configure data structures for your application as described in the following steps:Create an empty parameter-value list by calling dmParamsCreate().Set the parameter values by one of the methods listed below:Use a function that sets up a standard configuration for a particular type of data: dmSetImageDefaults() for images, dmSetAudioDefaults() for audio. See IDREF="58937" TYPE="TITLE""Creating Default Audio and Image Configurations" for a description of this method.Use a generic function such as dmParamsSetInt() to set the values of individual parameters within an empty parameter-value list or one that has already been initialized with the standard audio or image configuration. See IDREF="36529" TYPE="TITLE""Setting and Getting Individual Parameter Values" for a description of this method.Use a library function such as mvSetMovieDefaults() to set a group of parameters specific to that library. See IDREF="93494" TYPE="TITLE""Creating a Default Movie Configuration" in Chapter 28 for a discussion of this method.Free the parameter-value list and its contents by calling dmParamsDestroy().These steps are described in detail in the sections that follow.LBL="" HELPID=""Creating and Destroying Parameter-value ListsSome libraries require you to allocate memory for parameter-value lists, but with the DM library, you need not allocate memory for parameter-value lists, because memory management is provided for you by theID="Media1-2DM25"ID="Media1-2DM26" dmParamsCreate() and dmParamsDestroy() routines. These routines work together as a self-contained block within which you create the parameter-value list, set the parameter value(s) and use them, and then destroy the structure, freeing its associated memory.dmParamsCreate() is the only function that can create a parameter-value list, and dmParamsDestroy() is the only function that can free one. This means that parameter-value lists are managed correctly when every call to create one is balanced by a call to destroy one.The creation function can fail because of lack of memory, so it returns an error code. The destructor can never fail.To create an empty parameter-value list, call ID="Media1-2DM27"ID="Media1-2DM28"dmParamsCreate(). Its function prototype is:DMstatus dmParamsCreate ( DMparams** returnNewList )where:returnNewListis a pointer to a handle that is returned by the DM LibraryIf there is sufficient memory to allocate the structure, a pointer to the newly created structure is put into *returnNewList and DM_SUCCESS is returned; otherwise, DM_FAILURE is returned.When you have finished using the parameter-value list, you must destroy it to free the associated memory. To free both the parameter-value list structure and its contents, call ID="Media1-2DM29"dmParamsDestroy(). Its function prototype is:void dmParamsDestroy ( DMparams* params )where:paramsis a pointer to the parameter-value list you want to destroyID="Media1-2DM30"IDREF="85899" TYPE="TEXT"Example 2-1 is a code fragment that creates a parameter-value list called ID="Media1-2DM31"params, then calls a Movie Library routine, mvSetDefaults(), to initialize the default movie parameters, and then destroys the list, freeing both the structure and its contents.LBL="2-1"Example 2-1 ID="85899"Creating and Destroying a Parameter-value List DMparams* params;

UST values are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing and are readily available for all the IRIS digital media libraries.Typically, the UST is used as a timestamp, that is, it is paired with a specific item or location in a digital media stream. Because each type of media, and similarly each of the libraries, possess unique attributes, the UST information is presented in a different manner in each library. IDREF="61001" TYPE="TABLE"Table 2-9 describes how UST information is provided by each of the libraries.COLUMNS="2"LBL="2-9"Table 2-9 ID="61001"Methods for Obtaining Unadjusted System TimeLEFT="0" WIDTH="126"LibraryLEFT="135" WIDTH="207"UST MethodLEFT="0" WIDTH="126"Digital Media LibraryLEFT="135" WIDTH="207"dmGetUST()LEFT="0" WIDTH="126"Audio LibraryLEFT="135" WIDTH="207"ALgetframenumber() and ALgetframetime()LEFT="0" WIDTH="126"MIDI LibraryLEFT="135" WIDTH="207"mdTell() and mdSetTimestampMode()LEFT="0" WIDTH="126"Video LibraryLEFT="135" WIDTH="207"ustime field in the DMediaInfo structureLEFT="0" WIDTH="126"Compression LibraryLEFT="135" WIDTH="207"ustime field in the CLimageInfo structureThe DM Library routine, dmGetUST(), returns a high-resolution, unsigned 64-bit number to processes using the digital media subsystem.

IDREF="37303" TYPE="TITLE"Part II, "Digital Audio and MIDI Programming," describes in detail the application programming interfaces (APIs) for these libraries, which are included in the IRIS Digital Media Development Environment:ID="Media2-1GS1"Audio Library (libaudio.a)Audio File Library (libaudiofile.so)Audio Utility Library (libaudioutil.so)CD Audio Library (libcdaudio.a)DAT Audio Library (libdataudio.a)MIDI Library (libmd.so)Each chapter presents the digital audio and MIDI libraries from a task-oriented perspective. Chapters are organized to cover topics in roughly the order you are concerned about them as you write audio or MIDI programs. To illustrate the use of the various component libraries, sample code fragments and demonstration programs are used throughout.Digital audio programs typically access analog or digitally recorded sound data that is either input directly to the workstation audio hardware or stored on disk, digital audio tape, or CD. The application then manipulates the data and outputs the result to analog or digital line-out jacks, to disk, or to tape. MIDI programs read, process, and produce MIDI data streams, which are in turn interpreted by MIDI devices such as synthesizers and drum machines that are distributed across a MIDI network. The libraries described in this part of this guide provide all the necessary features to create audio and MIDI applications for Silicon Graphics workstations that support audio.Reference documentation on the digital audio and MIDI routines is contained in online reference pages. These provide a concise, thorough description of each library function and are available through the use of the man or Xman command.This guide assumes that you're somewhat familiar with principles of digital audio and MIDI.

The audio device contains settings pertaining to the configuration of both the internal audio system and the external electrical connections.ID="Media2-4AL4"ALportID="Media2-4AL5"A one-way (input or output) audio data connection between an application program and the host audio system. An ALport contains:ID="Media2-4AL6"ID="Media2-4AL7"an audio sample queue, which stores audio samples awaiting input or outputsettings pertaining to the attributes of the digital audio data it transportsSome of the settings of an ALport are static; they cannot be changed once the ALport has been opened. Other settings are dynamic; they can be changed while an ALport is open.ALconfigID="Media2-4AL8"An opaque data structure for configuring these settings of an ALport:audio device (static setting)size of the audio sample queue (static setting)number of channels (static setting)format of the sample data (dynamic setting)width of the sample data (dynamic setting)range of floating point sample data (dynamic setting)LBL="" HELPID=""Digital Audio Data RepresentationThe digital representation of an audio signal is generated by periodically sampling the amplitude (voltage) of the audio signal. The samples represent periodic "snapshots" of the signal amplitude. The Nyquist Theorem provides a way of determining the minimum sampling frequency required to accurately represent the information (in a given bandwidth) contained in an analog signal. Typically, digital audio information is sampled at a frequency that is at least double the highest interesting analog audio frequency. See ID="Media2-4AL9"ID="Media2-4AL10"The Art of Digital Audio or a similar reference on digital audio for more information.LBL="" HELPID=""Digital Audio Sample RatesThe ID="Media2-4AL11"sample rate is the frequency at which samples are taken from the analog signal. Sample rates are measured in hertz (Hz). A sample rate of 1 Hz is equal to one sample per second. For example, when a mono analog audio signal is digitized at a 48 kilohertz (kHz) sample rate, 48,000 digital samples are generated for every second of the signal.ID="Media2-4AL12"To understand how the sample rate relates to sound quality, consider the fact that a telephone transmits voice-quality audio in a frequency range of about 320 Hz to 3.2 kHz. This frequency range can be represented accurately with a sample rate of 6.4 kHz. The range of human hearing, however, extends up to approximately 18≠20 kHz, requiring a sample rate of at least 40 kHz.ID="Media2-4AL13"The sample rate used for music-quality audio, such as the digital data stored on audio CDs is 44.1 kHz. A 44.1 kHz digital signal can theoretically represent audio frequencies from 0 kHz to 22.05 kHz, which adequately represents sounds within the range of normal human hearing. The most common sample rates used for DATs are 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz. Higher sample rates result in higher-quality digital signals; however, the higher the sample rate, the greater the signal storage requirement.ID="Media2-4AL14"LBL="" HELPID=""Digital Audio Sample FramesA ID="Media2-4AL15"sample frame is a set of audio samples that are coincident in time. A sample frame for mono data is a single sample. A sample frame for stereo data consists of a left-right sample pair. A sample frame for 4-channel data has two left-right sample pairs (L1, R1, L2, R2).Stereo samples are interleaved; left-channel samples alternate with right-channel samples. 4-channel samples are also interleaved, but each frame has two left-right sample pairs.ID="Media2-4AL16"ID="Media2-4AL17"IDREF="70857" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-1 shows the relationship between the number of channels and the frame size of audio sample data.ID="Media2-4AL18"FILE="Media2-4AL.cgm" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="6-1"Figure 6-1 ID="70857"Audio Samples and FramesLBL="" HELPID=""Digital Audio Sample FormatsThe AL uses a digital data format called linear ID="Media2-4AL19"pulse code modulation (PCM) (see the audio references for a definition of this term) to represent digital audio samples.The formats supported by the AL and the audio system are:ID="Media2-4AL20"8-bit and 16-bit signed integer24-bit signed, right-justified within a 32-bit integer32-bit and 64-bit floating pointNoteThe audio hardware supports 16-bit I/O for analog data and 24-bitI/O for AES/EBU digital data.ID="Media2-4AL21"For floating point data, the application program specifies the desired range of values for the samples; for example, from -1.0 to 1.0.LBL="" HELPID=""Digital Audio Input and Output Sample ResolutionsThe native data format used by the audio hardware is 24-bit two's complement integers. The audio hardware sign-extends each 24-bit quantity into a 32-bit word before delivering the samples to the Audio Library.ID="Media2-4AL22"Audio input samples delivered to the Audio Library from the Indigo, Indigo2, and Indy audio hardware have different levels of resolution, depending on the input source that is currently active; the AL provides samples to the application at the desired resolution. You can also write your own conversion routine if desired.ID="Media2-4AL23"Microphone/line-level input samples come from analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, which have 16-bit resolution. These samples are treated as 24-bit samples with 0's in the low 8 bits.ID="Media2-4AL24"AES/EBU digital input samples have either 20-bit or 24-bit resolution, depending on the device that is connected to the digital input; for the 20-bit case (the most common), samples are treated as 24-bit samples, with 0's in the least significant 4 bits. The AL passes these samples through to the application if 24-bit two's complement is specified. If two's complement with 8-bit or 16-bit resolution is specified, the AL right-shifts the samples so that they will fit into a smaller word size. For floating point data, the AL converts from the 24-bit format to floating point, using a scale factor specified by the application to map the peak integer values to peak float values.ID="Media2-4AL25"For audio output, the AL delivers samples to the audio hardware as 24-bit quantities sign-extended to fill 32-bit words. The actual resolution of the samples from a given output port depends on the application program connected to the port. For example, an application may open a 16-bit output port, in which case the 24-bit samples arriving at the audio processor will contain 0's in their least significant 8 bits.The Audio Library is responsible for converting between the output sample format specified by an application and the 24-bit native format of the audio hardware. For 8-bit or 16-bit integer samples, this conversion is accomplished by left-shifting each sample written to the output port by 16 bits and 8 bits, respectively. For 32-bit or 64-bit floating point samples, this con version is accomplished by rescaling each sample from the range of floating point values that is specified by the application to the full 24-bit range and then rounding the sample to the nearest integer value. ID="Media2-4AL26"LBL="" HELPID=""Handling Audio Library ErrorsThis section describes techniques for error handling in AL applications.ID="Media2-4AL27"When the AL encounters an error, it:Checks to see whether an error handler is set, and if so, calls the specified routine.Sets an error code, and returns a failure from the function call.The default error handler prints a message to ID="Media2-4AL28"stderr. Although these error messages may be helpful for debugging during the development phase, you should turn off the default error handler in order to provide more effective error handling by using the IRIX ID="Media2-4AL29"oserror(3C) system call to retrieve function return codes.To turn off the default error handler, call ID="Media2-4AL30"ID="Media2-4AL31"ALseterrorhandler(). Its function prototype is:ALerrfunc ALseterrorhandler ( ALerrfunc efunc )where:efuncis a pointer to an alternate error-handling routine of type ALerrfunc that is declared as:ID="Media2-4AL32"void errorfunc ( long arg1, const char* arg2, [args] )Substituting zero for efunc turns off the error handler.Most AL routines set error codes when they fail. Throughout this guide, the return values and relevant error codes are listed along with the description of each routine. You can retrieve these error codes by calling oserror(3C). Based on these return codes, programs can adapt or recover, and/or alert the user by displaying a dialog box type of notifier or by printing information to the shell window from which the application was launched.LBL="" HELPID=""Audio Library Application Programming ConceptsID="Media2-4AL33"Typically, your AL program must:initialize data structuresset up buffers for passing data between your application and the CPUquery for available featuresconfigure and open audio connectionspass data to and from the ALport and operate on that dataprocess errorsclose audio connectionsfree system resourcesThe sections that follow explain these concepts in detail.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="25005"Initializing an Audio Library ApplicationID="Media2-4AL34"To enable audio input and output, your application must create and configure the required audio I/O connections. This section describes how to set up and use the AL data structures that provide audio I/O capability.ID="Media2-4AL35"LBL="" HELPID=""About ALportsThe AL provides an opaque data structure called an ALport for audio I/O connections. An ALport provides a one-way (input or output) mono, stereo, or 4-channel audio data connection between an application program and the host audio system. More than one ALport can be opened by the same application; the number of ALports that can be active at the same time depends on the hardware and software configurations you are using.ID="Media2-4AL36"An ALport consists of a sample queue and static and dynamic state information. For audio input, the hardware places audio samples in an input port's queue at a constant rate, and your application program reads the samples from the queue. Similarly, for audio output, your application writes audio samples to an output port's queue, and the audio hardware removes the samples from the queue. A minimum of two ALports are necessary to provide input and output capability for an audio application.ID="Media2-4AL37"LBL="" HELPID=""Using ALconfig Structures to Configure ALportsYou can open an ALport with the default configuration or you can customize an ALconfig for configuring an ALport suited to your application needs.ID="Media2-4AL38"ID="Media2-4AL39"The default ALconfig has:ID="Media2-4AL40"a buffer size of 100,000 samplesID="Media2-4AL41"stereo dataID="Media2-4AL42"a two's complement sample formatID="Media2-4AL43"a 16-bit sample widthID="Media2-4AL44"These settings provide an ALport that is compatible with CD- and DAT-quality data, but if your application requires different settings, you must create an ALconfig with the proper settings before opening a port.

For example, if the queue is too small, the application may take too long supply new samples, resulting in audible breaks that sound like pops or clicks. The size of the queue determines the maximum delay that can be tolerated while waiting for the application to get more samples at the given sample rate. To determine how much space to allocate for the sample queue, consider the data type and rate. For example, the default queue size of 100,000 samples provides buffer space for slightly more than one second of 48 kHz stereo audio data, and a little more than three seconds of 32 kHz mono data. To better understand these phenomena, see ID="Media2-4AL55"ID="Media2-4AL56"IDREF="74750" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-2 on IDREF="74750" TYPE="TEXT"page 91 for an illustration of a sample queue and read the associated discussion.ID="Media2-4AL57"TipThe main point to be concerned about is how full to keep the queue, regardless of its size. If the queue is full, more time passes before samples are played. The ideal situation is to keep enough samples in the queue to allow for the longest possible delay that will be experienced in retrieving the next batch of samples.

LBL="" HELPID=""Using Audio Sample QueuesAudio samples are placed in the sample queue of an ALport to await input or output (see ID="Media2-4AL92"IDREF="74750" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-2). The audio system uses one end of the sample queue; the audio application uses the other end.During audio input (left side of IDREF="74750" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-2), the audio hardware continuously writes audio samples to the tail of the input queue at the selected input rate, for example, 44,100 sample pairs per second for 44.1 kHz stereo data. If the application can't read the samples from the head of the input queue at least as fast as the hardware writes them, the queue fills up and some incoming sample data is irretrievably lost.During audio output (right side of IDREF="74750" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-2), the application writes audio samples to the tail of the queue. The audio hardware continuously reads samples from the head of the output queue at the selected output rate, for example, 44,100 sample pairs per second for 44.1 kHz stereo data, and sends them to the outputs. If the application can't put samples in the queue as fast as the hardware removes them, the queue empties, causing the hardware to send 0-valued samples to the outputs (until more data is available), which are perceived as pops or breaks in the sound.For example, if an application opens a stereo output port with a queue size of 100,000, and the output sample rate is set to 48 kHz, the application needs to supply (2 name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180
	TeX='\times ' descr='[times]' 48,000 = 96,000) samples to the output port at the rate of at least 1 set of samples per second, because the port contains enough space for about one second of stereo data at that rate. If the application fails to supply data at this rate, an audible break occurs in the audio output.On the other hand, if an application tries to put 40,000 samples into a queue that already contains 70,000 samples, there isn't enough space in the queue to store all the new samples, and the program will block (wait) until enough of the existing samples have been removed to allow for all 40,000 new samples to be put in the queue. The AL routines for reading and writing block; they do not return until the input or output is complete.IDREF="74750" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-2 shows how input and output ports use audio sample queues.ID="Media2-4AL93"ID="Media2-4AL94"FILE="6-2.online.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="6-2"Figure 6-2 ID="74750"Audio Sample Queues LBL="" HELPID=""Monitoring the Audio Sample Queue Status to Provide Nonblocking I/OThis section explains how to use the AL routines for monitoring the status of an ALport's sample queue.ID="Media2-4AL95"The AL maintains the following status information about the queue:filledID="Media2-4AL96"the number of queue locations that contain valid datafillableID="Media2-4AL97"the number of empty locations in the queueThe sum of the empty locations and the full locations is the total size of the queue:ID="Media2-4AL98"filled + fillable = queuesizeChecking the filled and fillable statuses before reading and writing prevents blocking and helps prevent overflow and underflow errors.ALgetfillable() ID="Media2-4AL99"and ID="Media2-4AL100"ALgetfilled() provide instantaneous information on the state of an audio port's queue.To prevent blocking during output, you can determine how many samples will fit into the queue by calling ALgetfillable() before writing any samples, and then write only that many samples to the queue.To get the number of empty queue locations in a given ALport, call ALgetfillable(). Its function prototype is:long ALgetfillable ( ALport port )where:portis the audio port whose queue is being examinedThe value returned indicates how many samples can still be written without blocking.To prevent blocking during input, you can determine how many samples are in the queue by calling ID="Media2-4AL101"ALgetfilled() before reading any samples, then read only that many samples from the queue.

The only currently supported device is AL_DEFAULT_DEVICE.Several of these routines expect parameter-value buffer (ID="Media2-4AL140"PVbuffer) arguments. A PVbuffer is simply an array of long integers, where the integers are logically organized as pairs of elements. The first element of each pair is a parameter constant defined in the include file audio.h. The second element of each pair stores a value associated with the parameter. The second location can be used to pass a value for a parameter into a routine or to return a value for a given parameter from a routine.TipYou don't have to pass an array containing all of the possible parameters; create an array that contains only the values of interest. Some methods for using these routines are:If you need a complete list of all available parameters, call ID="Media2-4AL141"ALqueryparams(). To be certain that you have a large enough buffer to contain the parameter-value pairs, you can pass a zero in place of the buffer, then call malloc() to allocate a buffer the size of the returned value.If you are interested only in certain values, create an array that is twice the size of the number of parameters you are querying, and fill the even locations with the parameters of interest, then: call ALgetparams() to determine the current settings of the state variables.fill in the even entries with the values that you want to change, and then call ALsetparams() to change the values.Some parameters might exist but might not allow the needed settings, so call ALgetminmax() to get the parameter bounds and check to be sure that the values you want to use exist.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting a List of Available ParametersALqueryparams() ID="Media2-4AL142"asks the audio device to supply a list of descriptors and corresponding descriptions for all the currently available global state variables.

 */LBL="" HELPID=""ID="63249"Audio Library Synchronization FacilitiesThe AL provides two different facilities for synchronization:The AL allows for multiple audio ports (ALports) to be synchronized in a sample accurate manner, by using the absolute sample frame count. The AL allows audio data to be related to other media based on common time line, by using the unadjusted system time (UST).The AL provides a method of determining the absolute sample count of the current sample frame under program control (that is, the sample frame which can be read/written with a call to the Audio Library) and a method of relating UST values to the count of samples which have entered or exited the audio device.As mentioned in IDREF="46771" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Programming with the Digital Media Library,"the digital media libraries provide a single time line, UST, through which media may be related. This time value is the number of nanoseconds since the operating system was started. As an absolute time value, UST is not particularly useful. However, it is extremely useful for relating different media types and for evaluating the relative timing of events.LBL="" HELPID=""Audio Sample Frame CountAbsolute sample frame count is the basis for timing within the AL. Whenever audio is input or output on a device, a count is kept of the sample frames elapsed. This sample frame count is the absolute number of sampling periods elapsed since input or output started. If the audio sample rate is set to 44100 kHz, the sample frame count advances at the nominal rate of 44100 counts per second, regardless of the channel setting for the port (see ALsetchannels() for more details on setting the number of channels for a port).The sample frame count increases regardless of whether an application is reading or writing audio samples using the ALreadsamps() or ALwritesamps() function calls, respectively. As long as an audio port (ALport) is open, the sample frame count advances.The AL function ALgetframenumber() provides a way for an application to query the absolute sample frame count associated with the current sample frame to be written (in the case of an output port) or read (in the case of an input port). The function prototype for ALgetframenumber() is:int ALgetframenumber(const ALport port,                     unsigned long long *framenum);where:portis the audio port of interestframenumis a pointer to a 64-bit number in which to hold the resultant frame count valueIf ALgetframenumber() succeeds, 0 is returned; otherwise a -1 is returned.Since the sample frame count is an absolute value of sample frames entering or exiting an audio device, two audio ports (ALports) can be synchronized by reading/writing samples at the identical sample frame count. This "port-to-port" synchronization is guaranteed to be sample accurate.In general, ALgetframenumber() does not return equal values for the sample frame count for different ports. In order to synchronize two audio ports, you will need to make the sample frame count of the two ports match by reading/writing samples from/to one of the sample queues. IDREF="51378" TYPE="TEXT"Example 6-7 demonstrates synchronizing two audio ports.NoteThe absolute sample frame count is valid only if the port in question does not overflow (in the case of input) or underflow (in the case of output). When your port underflows or overflows, the value of the sample frame count continuously changes, and you cannot reliably place samples in the queue at a desired location. In order to reestablish a valid value for sample frame count (and hence synchronization) your application must recover from the underflow or overflow (read or write samples as appropriate) and then query for the value of sample frame count again. IDREF="98922" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 6-3 shows the relationship of the sample frame count returned by ALgetframenumber() to sample frames in the queue associated with an input or output audio port (ALport).FILE="6-3.online.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="6-3"Figure 6-3 ID="98922"Sample Frame Count as Returned by ALgetframenumber() In IDREF="14252" TYPE="TEXT"Example 6-6, the first two ALwritesamps() calls are used to bring the audio ports out of an underflow condition.

}LBL="" HELPID=""Relating Audio Sample Frame Count to USTThe IRIS digital media libraries provide a time line called unadjusted system time (UST) for relating media to one another. The UST is a 64-bit count of the number of nanoseconds elapsed since the workstation operating system was started.The AL provides a way for application programs to relate the number of audio sample frames input to or output from a device to UST values, by providing a pair of values (UST, sample frame count) simultaneously. The UST value is the time when the samples in the frame entered the audio device (in the case of input) or exited the audio device (in the case of output). That is, the UST is the time at which the samples physically "hit the jacks." The audio system software accounts for any latency in hardware and intermediate buffering.The AL function ALgetframetime() provides both UST and sample frame count for an audio port (ALport) to an application. The function prototype for ALgetframetime() is:int ALgetframetime(const ALport port,                   unsigned long long *fnum,                   unsigned long long *ustime);where:portis the audio port of interestustimeis a pointer to a 64-bit number to hold the value of USTfnumis a pointer to a 64-bit number to hold the value of sample frame countIf ALgetframetime() succeeds, it returns 0 to the application; otherwise, it returns a -1 and sets an error number which can be retrieved with oserror(3C).When an application program calls the ALgetframetime() function, the AL provides the most recent pair of (UST, sample frame count) that it has calculated. In general, the value of sample frame count returned by ALgetframetime() is not the same as the sample frame count value returned by ALgetframenumber(). However, a UST value corresponding to the sample frame count returned by ALgetframenumber() can be calculated from (UST, sample frame count) pairs.IDREF="51378" TYPE="TEXT"Example 6-7 demonstrates calculating the UST value for the next sample to be read from an input port.LBL="6-7"Example 6-7 ID="51378"Calculating UST/* getust.c - get ustime for first sample in input port */

main(void)
{
    ALport port;
    long long count_1, count_2, ustime_1, ustime_2;
    double nrate;

    nrate = 1e+9/44100.0; /* nanosecs per sample @ 44.1 kHz*/

    ustime_2 = ustime_1 - (count_1 - count_2)*nrate;

 /* ustime_2 corresponds to the first sample frame in port */

    printf("ust(1) = %lld msc(1) = %lld\n",
           ustime_1, count_1);
    printf("ust(2) = %lld msc(2) = %lld\n",
           ustime_2, count_2);

    ALcloseport(port);
}This example code could have calculated the sample frame rate from multiple (UST, sample frame count) pairs and used that value instead of calculating it from the nominal audio frame rate.NoteThe sample frame value returned by ALgetframenumber() is valid only if the port does not overflow/underflow. In the case of underflow or overflow, the (UST, sample frame count) pair will continue to be valid (though you may wish to request a new, more recent, pair). Note, however, that two back-to-back invocations of ALgetframetime() are not guaranteed to result in unique (UST, sample frame count) pairs.

These routines, together with the ID="Media2-4AL161"select() or ID="Media2-4AL162"poll() IRIX system calls, make it possible to write applications that can multiplex audio processing tasks with other processing such as user interfaces, audio signal processing, or graphics. Other IRIX system calls, such as ID="Media2-4AL163"prctl(), schedctl(), and sproc(), also help audio applications to achieve efficient real-time performance. This section discusses these routines and techniques for using them effectively. See the online book, Topics in IRIX Programming, for a description of the IRIX real-time programming facilities. ID="Media2-4AL164"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="89705"Multiplexing Synchronous I/OThe ID="Media2-4AL165"select() system call makes it possible for an application to multiplex synchronous I/O tasks. An application passes ID="Media2-4AL166"select() three (optionally null) lists of file descriptors, along with an optional timeout parameter. ID="Media2-4AL167"select() blocks until one or more of the following conditions occur:one or more of the file descriptors in the "read list" are ready for readingone or more of the file descriptors in the "write list" are ready for writingan exceptional condition is pending for one of the file descriptors in the "exception list"a timeout occurs (if specified)When select() returns, it replaces the original file descriptor lists with subsets containing the file descriptors for which requested events have occurred. See the select(2) man page for details.The AL provides a mechanism to control the behavior of select() such that you can wake a process before an output queue runs out of samples or before an input sample queue overflows. The functions described in this section control the behavior of select().LBL="" HELPID=""Getting a File Descriptor for an ALportALgetfd() ID="Media2-4AL168"returns an IRIX file descriptor for a port that may be used with the ID="Media2-4AL169"select() call. Its function prototype is:int ALgetfd ( ALport port )where:portis the audio port whose file descriptor you want. This descriptor can then be used to construct the arguments for a call to select() or poll()When using select(), an input port's file descriptor is used in a read fdset and an output port's file descriptor is used in a write fdset.When using ID="Media2-4AL170"poll(), an input port's file descriptor is used with the POLLIN event flag and an output port's file descriptor is used with the POLLOUT event flag.ID="Media2-4AL171"ID="Media2-4AL172"These select() and poll() system calls are used to give up application control of the CPU until the audio port is emptied or filled past a previously set fill point (see the description of ALsetfillpoint() below).LBL="" HELPID=""Setting and Getting the Fill Point for a QueueALsetfillpoint() ID="Media2-4AL173"allows an application to set a threshold level for an input or output port that controls the behavior of the ID="Media2-4AL174"select() function. Its function prototype is:int ALsetfillpoint ( ALport port, long fillpoint )where:portis the audio port whose fill point you want to setfillpointis the fill point value, in number of samplesFor an input port, the fill point is the number of locations in the sample queue that must be filled in order to trigger a return from ID="Media2-4AL175"select(). For an output port, the fill point is the number of locations that must be free in order to wake up from select().When used in conjunction with ALgetfd() and select() or poll(), ALsetfillpoint() lets you programmatically relinquish control from an audio application to other processes.NoteALreadsamps()ID="Media2-4AL176" and ID="Media2-4AL177"ALwritesamps() may alter the fill point, so you should (re)set it just before you call select() or poll().

This function allows the program to change its execution priority. To maintain real-time audio processing, an application may need to be placed at a high priority relative to other jobs in the system. See the schedctl(2) manual page and for more information on usage. See IDREF="81687" TYPE="TITLE""Using Shared Arenas and Semaphores" for an  example  program that demonstrates how to use schedctl().LBL="" HELPID=""Preventing Memory Swapoutprctl() ID="Media2-4AL183"is an IRIX function that gives you control of certain attributes of a process. By using the ID="Media2-4AL184"PR_RESIDENT argument, you can make your audio process immune to kernel memory swapout, thus helping to ensure uninterrupted audio input and output. See the prctl(2) man page for more details.You can also use mpin() or plock() to lock user pages into memory. See the man pages for those functions for more information.LBL="" HELPID=""Creating Multiple Process ThreadsThe sproc() system call lets you split a process into two threads. sproc() is an IRIX system call similar to fork(), except that it makes use of shared memory. The shared memory features of sproc() allow sharing of data, file descriptors, and address space between the two process threads. When using sproc() in an application with audio, you can create one thread that services audio and another thread that handles the user interface. Using sproc() permits the use of graphical user interfaces without interrupting the audio data stream.  See IDREF="81687" TYPE="TITLE""Using Shared Arenas and Semaphores" for an  example  program that demonstrates how to use sproc() in conjunction with an IRIS IM menu (IRIS IM is Silicon Graphics' port of the industry-standard OSF/Motif).LBL="" HELPID=""ID="81687"Using Shared Arenas and SemaphoresAnother real-time programming technique is to use an IRIX ID="Media2-4AL185"shared arena. In essence, a shared arena is a memory-mapped file that you can access just like regular memory.This section provides some hints for working with shared arenas; more information is available in Topics in IRIX Programming.Shared arenas allow:shared memory between unrelated processesID="Media2-4AL186"shared synchronization tools: ID="Media2-4AL187"locks for controlling access, and semaphoresID="Media2-4AL188" for process communicationCreate a shared arena by calling ID="Media2-4AL189"usinit(). (The "us" prefix stands for user space.) The first process that calls usinit() creates an arena with the given file name; subsequent calls to usinit() invoking the same file name attach to the existing arena.Using shared memory can create data dependency situations such as different process writing to the same memory location at the same time, or one process trying to read from a memory location before another has finished writing to that location. Areas where a potential data dependency exists are called ID="Media2-4AL190"ID="Media2-4AL191"critical regions.Critical regions can be protected with locks, which keep trying until access is gained, or semaphores, which sleep until access is available. Semaphores can be used to allow multiple processes into a critical region at the same time. Processes waiting on a semaphore are queued on a first-come, first-served basis. To acquire (decrement) a semaphore, call ID="Media2-4AL192"ID="Media2-4AL193"uspsema(); to release (increment) call ID="Media2-4AL194"usvsema(). When uspsema causes the semaphore count to go negative, the process will block until some other process calls usvsema().The APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/audio/motifexample.c" PARMS=""motifexample.c

Currently, the AF Library supports the Apple Computer Inc. Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) and the Audio Interchange File Format with Compression (AIFF-C).The AF Library currently supports read-only and write-only file access (but not both simultaneously). Therefore, to alter an existing file, you must create a new file and copy data from the original file. Sample code that demonstrates how to copy the logical components of a file, and other concepts, is available online in ID="Media2-5AF3"ID="Media2-5AF4"/usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/soundfile.The Audio File Library comprises routines that handle four basic tasks:ID="Media2-5AF5"creating and configuring new audio filesreading and writing track information to and from audio filesreading and writing instrument configurations to and from audio filesreading and writing miscellaneous data to and from audio filesIn this chapter:IDREF="63966" TYPE="TITLE""Audio File Library Basics" discusses the basics of programming with the AF Library.IDREF="10191" TYPE="TITLE""Creating and Configuring Audio Files" explains how to initialize AF Library data structures.IDREF="78081" TYPE="TITLE""Opening, Closing, and Updating Audio Files" explains how to create and use audio files.IDREF="20612" TYPE="TITLE""Reading and Writing Audio Track Information" explains how to work with audio file tracks.IDREF="90519" TYPE="TITLE""Audio File Library Programming Tips" contains important programming tips for making AF Library programs format independent and multithread/multiprocessor safe.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="63966"Audio File Library BasicsThis section explains fundamental AF Library concepts.LBL="" HELPID=""Audio File Library Programming ModelThe AF Library has two basic data structures:AFfilesetup, an audio file setup that stores initialization parameters used when creating a new audio file handleAFfilehandle, an audio file handle that provides access to the audio fileThe basic steps required for setting up an audio file for writing are:ID="Media2-5AF6"Initialize an AFfilesetup, by calling AFnewfilesetup().Configure the AFfilesetup for your data, as described in IDREF="92961" TYPE="TITLE""Creating an Audio File Setup".Open an audio file for reading or writing, as described in IDREF="92961" TYPE="TEXT"IDREF="92961" TYPE="TITLE""Creating an Audio File Setup" by calling either AFopenfile() or AFopenfd().

You can replace the default AF Library error handler with one of your own.AFseterrorhandler() lets you replace the default error handler function with one of your own. Its function prototype is:AFerrfunc AFseterrorhandler(AFerrfunc errfunc)where errfunc is a pointer to an alternate error handling routine of type AFerrfunc that is declared as:void errfunc(long arg1, const char* arg2)LBL="" HELPID=""About Audio FilesThis section explains basic concepts for working with audio files. It describes data structures used by the Audio File Library and in particular, the structure of AIFF-C files and the higher-level abstraction that the AF Library API uses to read and write AIFF-C (and AIFF) files.ID="Media2-5AF8"The AF Library breaks audio files into the following four functional components:ID="Media2-5AF9"COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="82"Audio file formatLEFT="90" WIDTH="250"Allows applications to identify audio file formats and 
format versions.ID="Media2-5AF10"LEFT="0" WIDTH="82"Audio tracksID="Media2-5AF11"LEFT="90" WIDTH="250"Contain audio sample data, parameters that 
characterize the data format (such as sample rate, 
channel configuration, and compression type), and

the track for looping and other purposes.LEFT="0" WIDTH="82"Instrument

dataLEFT="90" WIDTH="250"Include text strings (author, copyright, name, 
annotation, and so on) and other non-audio information 
(such as MIDI data and application-specific data).The two portions of an audio file you will make most use of are audio tracks and instrument configurations.LBL="" HELPID=""Audio File FormatsAudio file format is typically indicated by header information preceding the actual data that describes the nature of the data in that file. The file format of an audio file constrains the data format of each of its tracks to one of a set of track formats supported by that file format, but you do not necessarily know which one. You must therefore set and query the track format for each of an audio file's tracks independently of its file format. It is often possible and desirable to write your application so that it queries only the data format(s) of the track(s) (instead of querying the file format) of the audio files it opens.LBL="" HELPID=""Audio Tracks, Sample Frames, and Track MarkersAudio tracks contain the recorded samples that produce sound when sent to the audio hardware. These samples are stored linearly for mono recordings and as interleaved left-right pairs (left channel in even locations, right channel in odd locations) for stereo recordings. These pairs are called ID="Media2-5AF14"ID="Media2-5AF15"sample frames (this term is also used for mono tracks, but a sample frame is the same thing as a sample when mono data is used). Audio tracks also contain trackID="Media2-5AF16"markers, which can be set to point to arbitrary locations in the audio track. These markers, which are identified by a long integer ID number and (optionally) a name string, point to locations between sample frames. LBL="" HELPID=""Audio Track Format ParametersData format information, including sample rate, sample format, sample width, and sample compression type is stored as part of the audio track. Several kinds of compression are supported (you can also choose not to use compression). The AF Library automatically compresses samples being written to a file and decompresses samples read from a file. The ability of the AF Library to perform compression/decompression of audio data in real time is dependent on system overhead. To guarantee real-time performance, you should make use of scheduling control as described in IDREF="19644" TYPE="TITLE""Using Scheduling Control to Give Audio High Priority" in Chapter 6.LBL="" HELPID=""Instrument Configurations and LoopsInstrument configurations contain a set of parameters that define the aspects of a sampler, including detuning, key velocity, and gain. They also contain ID="Media2-5AF17"ID="Media2-5AF18"ID="Media2-5AF19"ID="Media2-5AF20"ID="Media2-5AF21"loopID="Media2-5AF22"markers, which identify the beginning and ending points of loops that allow all or part of the audio track to be repeated. These loop markers point to previously created audio track markers, which in turn refer to locations in the audio track that comprise the beginning and ending of the loop. AIFF and AIFF-C files support two kinds of loops, ID="Media2-5AF23"sustain and releaseID="Media2-5AF24", each with a beginning and ending marker, which can be used in audio tracks and track markers.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="42513"ID="91555"AIFF-C and the AF Library APISilicon Graphics has adopted AIFF-C as its standard digital audio file format. AIFF-C is based on Apple Computer's Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF), which conforms to the ID="Media2-5AF25"ID="Media2-5AF26"ID="Media2-5AF27"EA IFF 85 Standard for Interchange Format Files developed by Electronic Arts. Unlike the older AIFF standard, AIFF-C files can store compressed sample data as well as two's complement linear PCM sample data. ID="Media2-5AF28"ID="Media2-5AF29"AIFF-C provides a standard file format for storing sampled sounds on magnetic media. The format can store any number of channels of sampled sound at a variety of sample rates and sample widths. The format is extensible, allowing future support of new compression types and application-specific data, while maintaining backward compatibility.ID="Media2-5AF30"An AIFF-C file is composed of a series of different kinds of data ID="Media2-5AF31"chunks. For the most part, the AF Library API handles low-level chunk manipulation. For complete information on the types of chunks supported by AIFF-C, see the ID="Media2-5AF32"Audio Interchange File Format with Compression (AIFF-C) Specification.Both AIFF and AIFF-C files consist of similar component structures. The chunks in an AIFF-C file are grouped together inside a special container chunk.

Its function prototype is:int AFgetfd(AFfilehandle file)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile().The file descriptor returned by AFgetfd() is intended for use in a select() loop. It is not intended to allow reading, writing, and seeking in an audio file without the knowledge of the Audio File Library. Doing so causes unpredictable results unless you save and restore the file position whenever you modify it.The AF does not reposition the file to the correct place before reading from (using AFreadframes()) or writing to (using AFwriteframes()) it. If you modify the file position of the file descriptor given by AFgetfd(), you should save the file position and restore it to its previous position before reading or writing data to the file. Alternately, you can use one of two different file descriptors opened to the same file. The file must be re-opened in order to get a separate file descriptor (dup(2) will not work because it gives you two file descriptors that share the same file offset).

}TipSometimes, instead of checking the file format, you should check the sampling format and other track parameters from the audio file track, as described in IDREF="33089" TYPE="TITLE""Getting and Setting Audio Track Parameters". For example, a program that simply reads 16-bit AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP audio data out of an AIFF file should be able to correctly read that type of data out of a file whose file format is not AIFF, as long as it does not also intend to read AIFF-specific chunks from the data (for example, certain MISC and INST chunks). Such a program has no need to call AFidentifyfd() or AFgetfilefmt() to get the file format.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="33089"Getting and Setting Audio Track ParametersMost audio track parameters (except markers) must be initialized before a new audio file is opened and cannot be modified after that point, but you should query an audio file for its track parameters.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting Audio Track Sample RateID="Media2-5AF89"AFgetrate() returns the sample rate of an audio track in an opened audio file. Its function prototype is:double AFgetrate(AFfilehandle file, long trackid)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), and trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK). AFgetrate() returns a double-precision floating point value that describes in Hz the audio sampling rate of the audio track.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="77680"Getting Audio Track Sample Format and Sample WidthID="Media2-5AF90"AFgetsampfmt() retrieves the sample format and sample width for an audio track in an opened audio file. Its function prototype is:void AFgetsampfmt(AFfilehandle file, long trackid,                  long *sampfmt, long *width)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), sampfmt is a pointer to a long integer denoting the format of the sample data (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value is always AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP), and width is a pointer to a long integer that denotes the sample width in bits (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value is between 1 and 32).TipDo not assume that AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP is the only value that can be returned by ID="Media2-5AF91"AFgetsampfmt(). Write your application so that it rejects files with sample formats it does not support.Sample width may or may not have meaning, depending on the value of sampfmt. For AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP data, you can use the sample width value to determine the data type used to pass samples to AFwriteframes() and from AFreadframes(): 1≠8 bit samples are packed into chars, 9≠16 bit samples are packed into shorts, and 17≠32 bit samples are packed into longs. Data formats whose sample width is not a multiple of eight are augmented by zero-bit-padding on the right (see IDREF="64196" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 7-1).There is a special case for reading 24-bit integer data. The AF automatically converts 3-byte data into 4-byte quantities in a manner that is compatible with the Audio Library (AL) by sign-extending the left-most bits of 17 to 24≠bit data.IDREF="64196" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 7-1 shows the data packing for twos complement integer data (AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP).FILE="compdata.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="7-1"Figure 7-1 ID="64196"Audio Data Packing FormatsTipDon't assume that the maximum size of integers in files opened by the AF Library is 32 bits or that the number of bits will be a multiple of 8. Even for AIFF files, the sample width is not necessarily a multiple of 8. Generally, this can be ignored, because audio samples that do not take up an integral number of bytes are left-justified inside the next larger integral number of bytes (with the remaining bits set to 0). But you should write your application so that it does not assume the sample width is a multiple of 8, as demonstrated in IDREF="56801" TYPE="TEXT"Example 7-2.IDREF="56801" TYPE="TEXT"Example 7-2 checks for the audio track sample format, and then classifies integer data according to its sample width.LBL="7-2"Example 7-2 ID="56801"Checking Audio Track Sample Format and Sample Width#include <dmedia/audiofile.h>

Its function prototype is:long AFgetchannels(AFfilehandle file, long trackid)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), and trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK). AFgetchannels() returns 1 if trackid is monaural, 2 if it is stereo, or any other positive integer (even for AIFF/AIFF-C files). TipYour application should be able to handle audio files containing an arbitrary number of channels. For example, the application could reject a file that has more than the supported number of channels, or it could combine channels selectively or use certain channels while ignoring others.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting AES DataID="Media2-5AF93"AFgetaeschanneldata() retrieves AES channel status information from an opened audio file. Its function prototype is:long AFgetaeschanneldata(AFfilehandle file, long trackid,                         unsigned char buf[24])where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), and buf is a 24-element array that receives the AES channel status bytes.AFgetaeschanneldata() returns a 1 if there is AES channel data, or a 0 if there is no data.TipThere is no guarantee whether a given file format will contain AES data, so your application should call AFgetaeschanneldata() to determine whether AES channel bytes are encoded in an audio file.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting Audio Track CompressionThis section describes routines that let you get compression information for an audio track from an AFfilehandle structure.When reading or writing a file (even an AIFF-C file) containing compressed data, first call AFgetsampfmt() to get the native sample format of the codec, and check that it is able to be read/written using that format. The native sample format of a codec is the sample format of the data it produces on decompression or expects on compression.TipYour application should reject compressed files with native sample formats it does not support. Check for an unrecognized format rather than a defined format. The currently defined codecs all convert the compressed data to and from 16-bit AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP data, but you should not assume that a certain format is guaranteed for future codecs. For example, if you know that the file is AF_COMPRESSION_G711_ULAW, then the native format for that codec is 16-bit AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP. However, you should call AFgetsampfmt() in any case, to allow for the possibility of future codecs whose native sample format is something other than 16-bit signed integer or which have more than one native sample format (some may be configurable or may vary depending on what kind of data was originally compressed).

It returns the number of marker structures in the specified audio track. Its function prototype is:long AFgetmarkids(AFfilehandle file, long trackid,                  long markids[])where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), and markids is an array of long integers that receives the marker IDs for the marker structures in the audio track.AFgetmarkids() returns a non-negative integer value specifying the number of marker structures in the given audio track.TipCheck for unrecognized mark return values rather than recognized values. Write your application so that it expects any number of marks and any type of mark (not just the currently defined types) and rejects files containing marks it does not support. Typically, you call AFgetmarkids() twice. The first time, you pass markids a null pointer and check the return value of the function. This value tells you how many locations to allocate in the markids array, which you pass back to AFgetmarkids() to obtain the list of marker IDs.ID="Media2-5AF99"AFgetmarkname() returns the name string of a given marker within the audio track of an opened audio file. Its function prototype is:char *AFgetmarkname(AFfilehandle file, long trackid,                    long markid)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), and markid is the ID of the marker whose name you want to retrieve.AFgetmarkname() returns a null-terminated character string that is the name associated with the given markid.ID="Media2-5AF100"AFgetmarkpos() returns the frame location of a given marker in the audio track of an opened audio file.

You can read and seek only from a file opened for reading. Similarly, you can write frames only to a file opened for writing.LBL="" HELPID=""Seeking to a Position in an Audio File TrackWhen a file is opened for read access by AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), the logical track pointer for the audio track is initialized to point to the first frame in the track. This location can be changed by calling AFseekframe(). Before returning, AFreadframes() moves the logical track pointer so that it points to the frame following the one last copied into frames. CautionThe logical track pointer is not the same thing as the IRIX file pointer which you position by calling the IRIX lseek(2) command.ID="Media2-5AF102"AFseekframe() moves the logical track pointer in the audio track of an audio file opened for read-only access to a specified frame. Its function prototype is:long AFseekframe(AFfilehandle file, long trackid,                 long offset)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), and offset is the number of frames from the beginning of the track that the pointer will be moved to. This value is between 0 and the total number of frames in the track, minus 1. The total number of frames in the track can be determined by calling AFgetframecnt().When AFseekframe() succeeds, it returns the actual offset value; otherwise, it returns a negative value.LBL="" HELPID=""Reading Audio Frames from an Audio TrackID="Media2-5AF103"AFreadframes() copies sample frames from an audio file opened for reading to a buffer. Its function prototype is:long AFreadframes(AFfilehandle file, long trackid,                  void *frames, long count) where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), trackid is the ID for the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), frames is a pointer to a buffer into which you want to transfer copies of sample frames from file, and count is the number of sample frames you want to read from file. AFreadframes() returns a long value indicating the number of frames successfully read from the audio track.The data copied into frames must be interpreted according to the sample format and sample width parameter returned by AFgetsampfmt() and channel count returned by AFgetchannels(), as described in IDREF="77680" TYPE="TITLE""Getting Audio Track Sample Format and Sample Width". For AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP, AFreadframes() copies the frames to the buffer using the smallest data type (char, short, or long) that capable of holding the data. AFreadframes() automatically decompresses data encoded using any of the supported compression algorithms. (For Aware compression, an Aware license must be installed.)TipQuery for the sample format, sample width, and channels. Don't assume that a particular file format determines the sample format, sample width, or number of channels. Provide a mechanism for detecting and handling unsupported file configurations.LBL="" HELPID=""Writing Audio Frames to an Audio TrackWhen a file is opened for write access by AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), the logical track pointer for the file's audio track is initialized to point to the first frame in the track. Before returning, AFwriteframes() moves the logical track pointer so that it points to the frame following the one last copied into samples.CautionThe logical track pointer is not the same thing as the IRIX file pointer which you position by calling the IRIX lseek(2) command.ID="Media2-5AF104"AFwriteframes() copies frames from a buffer to an audio file opened for writing. Its function prototype is:long AFwriteframes(const AFfilehandle file, long track,                   void samples, const long count) where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), track is a long integer which identifies the audio track (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_TRACK), samples is a pointer to a buffer containing sample frames that you want to write to file, and count is the number of sample frames you want to write to file. For AF_SAMPFMT_TWOSCOMP data, AFwriteframes() expects the frames to be buffered using the smallest data type (char, short, or long) capable of holding the data. AFwriteframes() automatically compresses data encoded using any of the supported compression algorithms.AFwriteframes() returns a long value indicating the number of frames successfully written to the audio track. The return value is normally greater than or equal to 0; however, when a codec is being used and buffered data cannot be written to disk, that data is lost. In such a case, AFwriteframes() returns a negative value, indicating the number of sample frames lost.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="44196"Reading and Writing Instrument ConfigurationsUse the functions in this section to retrieve and manipulate instrument configuration data and parameters.ID="Media2-5AF105"LBL="" HELPID=""Getting and Setting Instrument ParametersUse the functions described in this section to retrieve and set the instrument configuration parameters of an audio file.

The first time, you pass instids a null pointer and check the return value of the function. This value tells you how many locations to allocate in the instids array, which you pass back to AFgetinstids() to obtain the list of instrument IDs.NoteThe AF Library currently supports only AIFF and AIFF-C file types, so the number of instrument chunks is always either 0 or 1. If the file does contain an instrument chunk, its ID will always be AF_DEFAULT_INST for AIFF and AIFF-C files. But other instrument configurations could be returned in future releases of the AF Library.TipWrite your application so that it checks for and rejects instrument configurations that you don't want to support.ID="Media2-5AF107"AFgetinstparamlong() retrieves a long instrument configuration parameter value from an instrument configuration in an open audio file.

Its function prototype is:void AFsetloopend(AFfilehandle file, long instid,                  long loopid, long markid)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), instid is the instrument ID for the instrument configuration chunk (for AIFF and AIFF-C files, this value should always be AF_DEFAULT_INST), loopid is the ID number associated with the loop whose ending point you wish to write, and markid is the audio track marker that you wish to assign as the ending point of the given loop.TipLoop queries can return any configuration of loops within an instrument, not just the fixed value of 2 in AIFF/AIFF-C files. Have your application check for and reject loop configurations it does not support.LBL="" HELPID=""Handling Miscellaneous Data ChunksThe following sections describe how to read to, write from, and get information about the miscellaneous data chunks in an audio file.ID="Media2-5AF115"LBL="" HELPID=""Getting Miscellaneous Data ParametersThis section describes functions that get information about the number, size and type of miscellaneous data chunks in an opened audio file.ID="Media2-5AF116"AFgetmiscids() returns the number of miscellaneous data chunks in a file and an array containing the IDs of each miscellaneous chunk. Its function prototype is:long AFgetmiscids(AFfilehandle file, long miscids[])file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(). miscids is an array of positive long integers that contains the IDs for the miscellaneous data chunks in file.AFgetmiscids() returns a long integer value equal to the number of miscellaneous data chunks in file. To fill the miscids array with the corresponding IDs, you first call AFgetmiscids() with a null miscids pointer, and then allocate a miscids buffer according to the return value. You can then call AFgetmiscids() again, passing the properly dimensioned miscids buffer to obtain the list of IDs.ID="Media2-5AF117"AFgetmisctype() returns the type of a given miscellaneous chunk. Its function prototype is:long AFgetmisctype(AFfilehandle file, long chunkid)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), and chunkid is a positive long integer miscellaneous chunk ID from the miscids array returned by AFgetmiscids().AFgetmisctype() returns a long integer constant that describes the chunk type. See IDREF="75400" TYPE="TABLE"Table 7-5 for the list of valid chunk types and constants. If the chunk is not of any of the types listed in IDREF="75400" TYPE="TABLE"Table 7-5, AFgetmisctype() will return the value AF_MISC_AIFF_UNRECOGNIZED.TipThe set of chunk types may expand at any time. Check for unrecognized chunk types rather than recognized chunk types. Write your application so that it expects any type of MISC chunk (not just the currently defined types) and rejects miscellaneous chunks it does not recognize. ID="Media2-5AF118"AFgetmiscsize() returns the size of a given miscellaneous data chunk in bytes. Its function prototype is:long AFgetmiscsize(AFfilehandle file, long chunkid)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), and chunkid is a positive long integer miscellaneous chunk ID from the miscids array returned by AFgetmiscids().AFgetmiscsize() returns a long integer value that describes the size of the data in the chunk in bytes. This number does not take into account null-terminators in strings, so you will need to add one to the value returned when actually reading string data (see AFreadmisc()).LBL="" HELPID=""Reading, Writing, and Seeking Miscellaneous DataThis section describes functions that read and write miscellaneous data and to position the read/write location pointer within the data portion of a miscellaneous chunk. The AFfilehandle structure maintains a logical read/write pointer for each miscellaneous data chunk in the file. Each pointer is initialized to point at the first data byte with the chunk when the AFfilehandle structure is created.TipTo avoid file corruption, don't copy MISC chunks from one file to another unless the content of those chunks is known. A chunk can contain references to other parts of the file that have been modified by the application, in which case attempting to copy it without properly modifying its contents would cause an error.ID="Media2-5AF119"AFreadmisc() reads data from a given miscellaneous chunk into a buffer, and returns the number of bytes read. Its function prototype is:long AFreadmisc(AFfilehandle file, long chunkid,                void *buf, long nbytes)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), chunkid is a positive long integer miscellaneous chunk ID from the miscids array returned by AFgetmiscids(), buf is a pointer to a buffer that will receive the data from the miscellaneous chunk, and nbytes is the number of bytes you want to read from the audio file into buf, beginning at the current position of file's logical read pointer for the data in miscid. AFreadmisc() will not read past the end of the chunk's data area. After reading the data, AFreadmisc() updates the position of the read/write pointer to point to the data byte following the last one read.ID="Media2-5AF120"AFwritemisc() writes data from a buffer to a given miscellaneous chunk, and returns the number of bytes successfully written. Its function prototype is:long AFwritemisc(AFfilehandle file, long chunkid,                 void *buf, long nbytes)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), chunkid is a positive long integer miscellaneous chunk ID from the miscids array returned by AFgetmiscids(), buf is a pointer to a buffer that contains the data you want to write to the miscellaneous chunk, and nbytes is the number of bytes you want to write to the audio file from buf, beginning at the current position of file's logical write pointer for the data in miscid. AFwritemisc() will not write past the end of the chunk's data area. After writing the data, AFreadmisc() updates the position of the read/write pointer to point to the data byte following the last one written.It is up to the application to fill the data area of a chunk with consistent information (for example, if you don't use all the bytes you allocated in a MIDI data chunk, you need to fill the remaining bytes with no-ops).ID="Media2-5AF121"AFseekmisc() moves the logical read/write pointer for a miscellaneous chunk to a specified offset from the beginning of the chunk's data area. Its function prototype is:void AFseekmisc(AFfilehandle file, long chunkid, long offset)where file is the AFfilehandle structure previously created by a call to AFopenfile() or AFopenfd(), chunkid is a positive long integer miscellaneous chunk ID from the miscids array returned by AFgetmiscids(), offset is a non-negative long integer specifying the number of bytes past the start of the data area the read/write pointer should be moved, and offset should always be less than the size of the total data area (in bytes).AFseekmisc() returns the new location of the logical read/write pointer, measured as the number of bytes from the beginning of the chunk data area.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="90519"Audio File Library Programming TipsThis section describes important Audio File Library programming tips: IDREF="21228" TYPE="TITLE""Minimizing Data and File Format Dependence" describes how to maximize application compatibility by minimizing format dependence.IDREF="36539" TYPE="TITLE""Preventing Concurrent Access from Multiple Threads" explains how to write a multithreaded AF application in order to prevent simultaneous access to an AFfilehandle from multiple threads.IDREF="69122" TYPE="TITLE""Handling Errors in Multithreaded Applications" explains how to prevent an error handler from reporting simultaneous errors from a multithreaded application.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="21228"Minimizing Data and File Format DependenceCurrently, the Audio File Library supports the AIFF and AIFF-C file formats. As the AF Library evolves to support new file formats (beyond AIFF and AIFF-C) and new data formats (beyond 2's complement integer and compressed data formats), file-format dependent applications will require more modifications to maintain compatibility than file-format independent programs. Making your application file format independent decreases the likelihood of compatibility problems with future releases of the library and minimizes future modifications. Programming tips presented throughout this chapter call attention to methods you can use to make your application format independent.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="36539"Preventing Concurrent Access from Multiple ThreadsThe AF is not multithread/multiprocessor safe. Making multiple, simultaneous, uncoordinated AF calls on different AFfilehandles from different threads is possible and correct. Each AFfilehandle completely encapsulates the state (except for error handling, which is global) needed to perform operations on that AFfilehandle. In contrast, making multiple, simultaneous, uncoordinated AF calls on the same AFfilehandle from different threads is currently possible, but it is not proper programming practice.In the following code, two threads are using one AFfilehandle:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"Thread 1LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Thread2LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"          Some amount of timeLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"         Some amount of timeLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"          No semaphore lockingLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"         No semaphore lockingLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"AFseekframe(h,track,place1;LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"AFseekframe(h,track,place2); LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"AFreadframes(h,track,...);LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"AFreadframes(h,track,...);LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"          Some amount of timeLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"         Some amount of timeLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"          No semaphore lockingLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"         No semaphore lockingLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"It is possible that these calls would be executed in the following order, in which case both threads would read the wrong data.:COLUMNS="3"LEFT="0" WIDTH="159"AFseekframe(h,track,place1);LEFT="165" WIDTH="19"||LEFT="190" WIDTH="154"LEFT="0" WIDTH="159"AFreadframes(h,track,...);LEFT="165" WIDTH="19"||LEFT="190" WIDTH="154"AFseekframe(h,track,place2); LEFT="0" WIDTH="159"LEFT="165" WIDTH="19"||LEFT="190" WIDTH="154"AFreadframes(h,track,...);The only way to ensure that concurrent operations take place in the correct order is to use a process coordination facility such as semaphore locking.Proper multithreading looks like this:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"Thread 1LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Thread 2LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"           Some amount of timeLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"         Some amount of timeLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"Lock Semaphore that guards hLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Lock Semaphore that guards hLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"AFseekframe(h,track,place1;LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"AFseekframe(h,track,place2); LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"AFreadframes(h,track,...);LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"AFreadframes(h,track,...);LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"Unlock Semaphore that guards hLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"Unlock Semaphore that guards hLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"LEFT="0" WIDTH="166"          Some amount of timeLEFT="175" WIDTH="166"         Some amount of timeLEFT="0" WIDTH="166"LEFT="175" WIDTH="166"IRIX guarantees that only one of the Lock Semaphore calls will succeed immediately. The thread whose lock does not succeed waits in the Lock Semaphore call (and thus does not proceed to the AFseekframe() call) until the other thread has unlocked the semaphore (after it has finished seeking and reading). When the first thread unlocks the semaphore, the thread that is waiting can now proceed.

But this is becausename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'by chancename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'the CPU scheduler timing has arranged the process timing so that both threads don't use the handle at the same time. Another time, the CPU scheduling might not be favorable, so it's best to protect the critical regions with semaphores.In summary, you cannot make multiple, simultaneous, uncoordinated AF calls on the same AFfilehandle from different threads, even if the order of execution of those calls does not matter. Doing so is likely to cause a core dump, or at least corruption of the AFfilehandle. The application is responsible for implementing any semaphore protection that is needed; such protection is not built in to the AF calls themselves.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="69122"Handling Errors in Multithreaded ApplicationsYou cannot make multiple, simultaneous, uncoordinated AF calls from different threads that affect the library's global statename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

If two threads simultaneously try to set the error handler (even if it is the same error handler), the behavior is undefined.If you write your own error handler and then make multiple, simultaneous, uncoordinated AF calls on different file handles from different threads (and both AF calls issue an error simultaneously), then two instances of your error handler are called in a simultaneous, uncoordinated manner in both threads.

LBL="" HELPID=""CD Frames, Samples, and SubcodesPer second of playing time, a CD contains 75 CD frames, each containing 588 stereo audio frames (that is, pairs of left and right channel audio samples). A CD frame has both audio and nonaudio information. The sum of the nonaudio information in a frame composes a single complete chunk of ID="Media2-6CD4"ID="Media2-6CD5"ID="Media2-6CD6"subcode. When in audio mode and reading from a CD, you need complete subcodes. Thus, in audio mode, a CD frame is the smallest parcel of information you can read from a CD.To give you controlled access to either the audio data or the subcode in a CD frame, libcdaudio hands you a CDFRAME structure: ID="Media2-6CD7"ID="Media2-6CD8"typedef struct cdframe {
char audio[CDDA_DATASIZE];
struct subcodeQ ;subcode;
} ;CDFRAME;
ID="Media2-6CD9"ID="Media2-6CD10"An audio sample is linearly encoded in a 16-bit two's-complement format. Because a complete stereo audio sample contains two interleaved channels, it takes four bytes of audio[] to contain a complete stereo audio sample.IDREF="62227" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 8-1 shows the structure of a CD audio sample.ID="Media2-6CD11"FILE="8-1.online.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="8-1"Figure 8-1 ID="62227"CD Audio Sample StructureThe byte ordering of the samples in audio[] is the raw data from the CD; its byte ordering is reversed from that on the Indigo workstation. The sampling rate at which CD audio data is originally recorded is 44.1 kHz; therefore, CDDA_DATASIZE (the size of ID="Media2-6CD12"ID="Media2-6CD13"audio[]) is defined as 2352. This allows for 588 stereo audio samples per CD frame, which, at 75 frames per second, allows for a sample rate of 44.1 kHz. The subcode member has three information modes: ID="Media2-6CD14"mode1for reporting on the track, index, and timing for the current CD track; or, if the current track is the nonaudio lead-in track (see ID="Media2-6CD15"IDREF="18765" TYPE="TITLE""CD Tracks, Indices, and Time Codes" ), mode1 contains a table of contents for the CDID="Media2-6CD16"mode2for reporting the catalog number for the CD as well as an absolute CD frame countmode3for reporting the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) identification information: country, owner, year, and serial numberID="Media2-6CD17"ID="Media2-6CD18"Thus, the subcodeQ structure in the CDFRAME structure contains a union of three structures: ID="Media2-6CD19"mode1, mode2, and mode3. Which mode is used depends on the information from the CD. For more information on the CDFRAME structure and the subcodeQ structure, see the ID="Media2-6CD20"CDFRAME(4) man page. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="18765"CD Tracks, Indices, and Time CodesAs many as 99 audio program tracks are allowed on a CD. These tracks are numbered 01 through 99. Two nonaudio tracks of general interest are also available: the lead-in track (numbered 00) and the lead-out track (numbered AA). Track 00, the lead-in track, contains a table of contents in its subcodes.ID="Media2-6CD21"ID="Media2-6CD22"A track can have up to 99 subdivisions containing audio information. These subdivisions use the index numbers 01 through 99. Index number 00 is used for the pause between the tracks. The time code gives the current minute, second, and CD frame for the current track. The ID="Media2-6CD23"subcodeQ structure with mode1 uses a cdtimecodeID="Media2-6CD24" structure to contain time codes.ID="Media2-6CD25"LBL="" HELPID=""CD Seeking, Reading, and PlayingAccessing information from a CD-ROM drive is analogous to accessing information from a standard disk drive. To read a particular piece of information from the CD, you must move to that location. The process of moving to a location on the CD is known as seeking.ID="Media2-6CD26"Reading from a CD-ROM drive is analogous to reading from a disk drivename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'you copy information from the device to a memory-resident buffer for further processing.Playing the CD is a variation on reading it. But instead of transferring the information to a buffer for processing, the information is dumped out the audio jacks on the back of the CD-ROM drive, with a minimum of buffering and with no real chance to process it. For information on processing audio from a CD through the workstation's audio hardware, see IDREF="65266" TYPE="TITLE""Reading Audio Data from the CD-ROM Drive".LBL="" HELPID=""CD ParserThe parser lets your application change state in response to changes in the subcode data on a CD. This lets you deal with the audio data in a way that is based on its content. To use the parser, you must give it callback routines that can deal the subcode changes that interest you. Then you set up a loop that reads CD frames from the CD and calls the parser for each CD frame. ID="Media2-6CD27"The parser checks the subcode in every submitted CD frame. If the parts of the subcode you care about have changed from the previous CD frame, the parser executes one of your callbacks and hands it the new subcode information. Within your callback, you can examine the subcode information and change the state of your application as needed. LBL="" HELPID=""Opening and Closing the CD-ROM DeviceThe CD-ROM device does not use a standard IRIX device driver. So, a session with the CD-ROM device starts by calling ID="Media2-6CD28"CDclose()ID="Media2-6CD29". For detailed information on these routines, see the man pages CDopen(3) and CDclose(3). LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling the CD-ROM Drive CaddyTo give your application control over the caddy-eject feature on the CD-ROM drive, libcdaudio defines the following routines:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="108"ID="Media2-6CD30"CDeject()LEFT="115" WIDTH="225"to eject the caddy from the CD-ROM driveID="Media2-6CD31"LEFT="0" WIDTH="108"ID="Media2-6CD32"CDpreventremoval()ID="Media2-6CD33"LEFT="115" WIDTH="225"to lock the CD-ROM drive eject button to prevent

But before you can call these routines, you need to know where you are going. For most applications, locations can come from either of two sources, the end user or calculations internal to your application. ID="Media2-6CD37"Seek destinations can be in any one of three forms:ID="Media2-6CD38"integer CD frame counts<minute, second, CD frame> integer triples"minute:second:CD frame" ASCII stringsThe ASCII format is the one you receive from an end user of your application; the other two formats are used for internal calculation.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting CD Locations from the End UserID="Media2-6CD39"If your application wants to give end users the option of seeking to a CD location defined in terms of time, your application can prompt the user for the time and then call CDatomsf() to convert the ASCII string to a <minute, second, CD frame> triple that you can use for seeking. You can also let the user specify a track number, convert that track number to an integer and seek to that track. ID="Media2-6CD40"LBL="" HELPID=""Getting CD Locations from Calculations Internal to Your ApplicationGenerally, the pure CD frame count is the most convenient format to use when comparing two locations.ID="Media2-6CD41"To convert to pure CD frame counts, call: COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"ID="Media2-6CD42"CDmsftoframe()LEFT="125" WIDTH="216"to convert a <minute, second, CD frame> triple

CDmsftoframe()ID="Media2-6CD45"LEFT="125" WIDTH="216"to convert an ASCII "minute:second:CD frame" 
string into a pure frame countYou can then make your calculations and determine the destination to which you want to seek. Despite the convenience of pure CD frame counts for calculation, they are not suitable for seeking. To seek, you must call CDframetomsf() to convert the pure CD frame count to a <minute, second, CD frame> triple.It is also possible to make comparisons between locations expressed in terms of minutes, seconds, and CD frames. In that case, you can convert locations into <minute, second, CD frame> triples by calling:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="126"ID="Media2-6CD46"CDatomsf()LEFT="135" WIDTH="207"to convert an ASCII string to a<minute, second, CD frame> tripleLEFT="0" WIDTH="126"ID="Media2-6CD47"CDframetomsf()LEFT="135" WIDTH="207"to convert a pure CD frame count to a

CDframetomsf()LEFT="135" WIDTH="207"to convert a time code to a<minute, second, CD frame> tripleAfter making these calculations, the location is in terms suitable for seeking. LBL="" HELPID=""Getting the Current CD Location To get your current location within a CD, call ID="Media2-6CD49"ID="Media2-6CD50"ID="Media2-6CD51"CDgetstatus(). This routine takes a CDSTATUS structure and fills it with information on current track, minute, second, CD frame, and additional data. To make it easier to compare your current location to another location, you should express the locations in terms of pure CD frame counts. But depending on how you got a location, it could be expressed as three separate integers giving the minute, second, and CD frame, or as an ASCII string, or as a cdtimecode structure. For more information on this routine, see the appropriate man pages.LBL="" HELPID=""Seeking to a CD LocationSeeking sets up the read pointer to retrieve data from a particular location on the CD. You can define the seek location in terms of: trackTo seek to a track, call ID="Media2-6CD52"ID="Media2-6CD53"CDseektrack().  absolute timeTo seek to a location defined in terms of minute, second, and CD frame, call ID="Media2-6CD54"CDseek(). logical blockTo seek to a location defined in terms of a logical block number, call ID="Media2-6CD55"CDseekblock(). (On a CD-ROM, one logical block contains a single CD frame, which is 588 stereo audio samples plus one complete subcode.)ID="Media2-6CD56"To do a series of consecutive seeks, your first seek can be defined in any of the formats mentioned above. But, because all seek routines return the logical block number of the next logical block, it is often more convenient to define the subsequent seeks in terms of logical blocks. ID="Media2-6CD57"If you want to do all seeks using CDseekblock(), but your first seek is defined in terms of time, call CDmsftoblock() to convert time to logical block number. NoteAlthough logical blocks and CD frames are the same size, you cannot use CD frame counts as if they were logical block counts. The CD frame counts are relative to the start of the CD. A logical block count is offset from the start of the CD. In addition, the size of the offset varies from device to device.

But how much data should you read at a time in order to create a continuous flow of data from the CD? To determine this, call ID="Media2-6CD68"CDbestreadsize(). The returned value of this function is the number of CD frames to request in your read call. To actually read data from the CD, call ID="Media2-6CD69"ID="Media2-6CD70"CDreadda(). Because libcdaudio already includes routines for playing audio data from the CD, you might think that you would never need to read from the CD; however, the libcdaudio play routines allow for only a very simple CD-player applicationname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'one that cannot even display the current program time while the CD is playing. Thus, if you are writing a real-world application, you probably want to read samples from the CD into the workstation's memory through the CD-ROM's SCSI interface, play the audio samples from the audio hardware using the Audio Library, parse the CD frames for the current program time, and display the program time in a continuously updated field of the control panel for your application. To do this, you can write your own play routine that executes as a cd_audio callback. You should also write a ID="Media2-6CD71"cd_ptime callback to get the current program time and to update your "program time" display. LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling the CD ParserAfter you have read data from the CD into a buffer, you can start to process it. Typically, how you process the audio data depends on what its associated subcodes tell you about the data. To make it possible for your application to avoid dealing with the complex CDFRAME structure directly, libcdaudio includes a parser. ID="Media2-6CD72"If you write a loop that passes all read CD frames through the parser, the parser can examine all CD frames for changes in the subcode. When the parser finds a change (seeing a subcode for the first time counts as a change), it executes the appropriate callback routinename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'depending on what sort of subcode change occurredname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'and passes the new subcode data into your callback routine. The CD parser distinguishes among eight categories of subcode information. Thus, if you are interested in subcode changes for only one category of subcode data, the parser does not bother your application with subcode changes that you consider irrelevant. LBL="" HELPID=""Allocating and Initializing the CD ParserTo allocate and initialize the parser data structures, call ID="Media2-6CD73"ID="Media2-6CD74"CDcreateparser(). To reset the parser after the user changes the CD in the CD-ROM drive, call ID="Media2-6CD75"CDresetparser().ID="Media2-6CD76" This clears out any information the parser has about the last CD frame but leaves the callback routines in place. LBL="" HELPID=""Defining Callbacks for the CD ParserWhen you define a callback for the parser, write a function of the form:ID="Media2-6CD77"MyCDSomethingCallBack( void* arg, CDDATATYPES type,
void* data) {
/* your code here */
}The parser uses the third parameter to pass in information it reads from the subcodes. The parser uses the second parameter to pass in the type of callback it thinks it is calling. You can use this to assign the same function to different types of callbacks. Internally, you can switch on the type. This feature is useful if two callbacks are essentially the same, with the exception of a few lines.The parser does not use the first parameter. You can use that to pass in information if your application needs to call the callback directly. LBL="" HELPID=""Adding Callbacks to the CD Parser To add callback routines to the parser, call ID="Media2-6CD78"CDaddcallback(). If you do not specify a callback for a category, the parser assumes that you are not interested in changes of that type. You can add callbacks that respond to changes in any of the following categories of subcode data:ID="Media2-6CD79"ID="Media2-6CD80"cd_audiocallbacks respond to changes in the audio data in a CD frame. You can use this class of callback to notify you when you are beyond the lead-in track and have started to see audio samples. When the parser calls this routine, it passes in the audio sample data. If this callback routine is a play routine for your application, it should write the audio sample to an audio port using the Audio Library. See the ALwritesamps(3) man page and IDREF="70508" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 6, "Programming with the Audio Library."cd_pnumcallbacks respond to changes in the program number. You can use this callback to notice when you have moved from one program (track) to the next. cd_indexcallbacks respond to changes in the index number. You can use this callback to notice when you have moved from one subsection of a track to the next.cd_ptimecallbacks respond to changes in the program time. You can use this callback to continuously update a "program time display" in a CD-playing application. cd_atimecallbacks respond to changes in the absolute time elapsed since the start of the CD. You can use this callback to continuously update your application's information about total elapsed time.cd_catalogcallbacks respond to changes in the catalog number for the CD. Because this information should not change within the CD, this sort of callback executes only oncename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'typically during the lead-in track for the CD. cd_identcallbacks respond to changes in the ISRC identification number for the recording on the CD. Because this information should not change within the CD, this sort of callback executes only oncename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'typically during the lead-in track for the CD.cd_controlcallbacks respond to changes in the control bits. These bits can tell you things such as whether the CD is copy protected and whether preemphasis is off or on. Because this information should not change within the CD, this sort of callback executes only oncename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'typically during the lead-in track.For more information on each callback type, see the CDaddcallback(3) man page. LBL="" HELPID=""Deleting and Changing a CD Parser CallbackTo delete a callback, call ID="Media2-6CD81"ID="Media2-6CD82"CDremovecallback(). To change a callback, call CDremovecallback() followed by CDaddcallback(). LBL="" HELPID=""Parsing CD Frames To submit a group of CD frames to the parser, your loop should set up a loop that calls CDparseframe()ID="Media2-6CD83"ID="Media2-6CD84" for each frame that you have read into your buffer.LBL="" HELPID=""Freeing the Memory Allocated for the Parser If you are done with the parser and want to free the memory it uses, callID="Media2-6CD85"ID="Media2-6CD86"CDdeleteparser() to delete the parser. LBL="" HELPID=""Communicating CD Status to the End UserIn addition to playing a CD or processing the information read from a CD, your application probably needs to tell the user something about the CD (even if it is only the number of the current track). Also, sometimes your application must take data from the end user and convert it to a form that the CD-ROM device can understand.ID="Media2-6CD87"To get information for the end user, call:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"ID="Media2-6CD88"CDgettrackinfo()LEFT="125" WIDTH="216"to get information about a particular trackLEFT="0" WIDTH="117"ID="Media2-6CD89"CDgetstatus()LEFT="125" WIDTH="216"to get information about the CD as a wholeThe CD frames, however, sometimes contain information that is not accessible to the routines mentioned above. For example, the subcodes of track 00 on a CD contain a table of contents. To access this information, you can inspect the subcodes in the CDFRAME structures, or, better still, you can submit that track to the parser. If you have added callbacks for the categories of subcode information that you want, the parser passes that information into your callbacks. To help you present the information the parser hands to your callbacks (or that you read directly from a CDFRAME structure), libcdaudio contains the routines: COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="81"ID="Media2-6CD90"CDsbtoa()LEFT="90" WIDTH="252"for converting the 6-bit ISRC country and owner code to

ID="Media2-7DAT1"ID="Media2-7DAT2"In this chapter:IDREF="82124" TYPE="TITLE""DAT Audio Library Basics" explains basic concepts for using libdataudio.IDREF="98073" TYPE="TITLE""Navigating through a DAT" explains getting locations from and seeking to locations on a DAT.IDREF="37686" TYPE="TITLE""Using the DAT Drive" explains how to use the DAT drive for playing and recording DATs, reading, writing and parsing DAT information, and communicating DAT status to the end user.IDREF="75008" TYPE="TITLE""DAT Sample Program" presents a DAT sample program. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="82124"DAT Audio Library BasicsThe DAT Audio Library (libdataudio) supports processing the data from a digital audio tape (DAT). Because the device driver for the DAT drive is a standard IRIX tape device driver, the libdataudio library does not need the special positioning and status calls. Instead, you can use the standard ID="Media2-7DAT3"open(), close(), read(), write(), and ioctl() system calls. This section describes the basic concepts that underlie libdataudio. Because both CDs and DATs digitally encode an audio signal as a series of samples, the concepts and terms used when dealing with these media are similar; however, there are some differences between them.LBL="" HELPID=""DAT Frames, Samples, and SubcodesA DAT contains 33.33 DAT frames per second of playing time. A DAT frame has both audio and nonaudio information. The sum of the nonaudio information in a DAT frame composes a single complete DAT subcode. When in audio mode and reading from a DAT, you need complete subcodes. Thus, in audio mode, a DAT frame is the smallest parcel of information you should read from a DAT.ID="Media2-7DAT4"ID="Media2-7DAT5"To give you controlled access to either the audio data or the subcode in a DAT frame, libdataudio hands you a ID="Media2-7DAT6"ID="Media2-7DAT7"DTFRAME structure: typedef struct dtframe {
char audio[DTDA_DATASIZE];
struct dtsubcode sc;
} DTFRAME;A DAT audio sample is linearly encoded in a 16-bit two's-complement format. Because a complete stereo audio sample contains two interleaved channels, it takes four bytes of ID="Media2-7DAT8"audio[] to contain a complete stereo audio sample (see IDREF="64805" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 9-1).FILE="9-1.online.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="9-1"Figure 9-1 ID="64805"DAT Audio Sample StructureThe byte ordering of audio sample frames in ID="Media2-7DAT9"audio[] is based on the raw data from the DAT; its byte ordering is reversed from that on the IRIS workstation. DTDA_DATASIZE (the size of audio[]) is defined as 5760. This allows for 1440 audio sample frames per DAT frame, which, at 33.33 DAT frames per second, is enough to deal with audio sampled at rates of up to 48 kHz. The subcode member uses a dtsubcode structure to contain the subcode read from the DAT. The subcodes contain information on sampling frequency, the number of channels, table of contents, catalog number, and more. For more information on the ID="Media2-7DAT10"ID="Media2-7DAT11"ID="Media2-7DAT12"ID="Media2-7DAT13"ID="Media2-7DAT14"dtsubcode structure, see the DATFRAME(3) man page. LBL="" HELPID=""DAT Audio Program Numbers and IndicesA DAT can have as many as 99 audio programs, each typically corresponding to a single song or musical piece. These programs are numbered 01 through 99. An audio program can have up to 99 subdivisions containing audio information. These subdivisions use the index numbers 01 through 99. Index number 00 is used for the pause between the audio programs. ID="Media2-7DAT15"LBL="" HELPID=""DAT Run Time, Absolute Time, and Program TimeA time code gives the hour, minute, second, and DAT frame offset into a DAT. When dealing with program time, the time code is a measure of the time elapsed since the start of the audio program. When dealing with absolute time, the time code measures the time elapsed since the start of the DAT. When dealing with run time, the time code measures the time elapsed since the beginning of the recording and contains several audio programs. ID="Media2-7DAT16"LBL="" HELPID=""DAT Seeking and ReadingAccessing information from a DAT drive is analogous to reading information from a standard tape drive. To read a particular piece of information from the DAT, you must move to that location. The process of moving to a location on the DAT is known as seeking. Reading from the DAT is analogous to reading from a tape drive. You copy information from the device to a memory-resident buffer for further processing. LBL="" HELPID=""DAT ParserThe parser lets your application change state in response to changes in the subcode data on a DAT. This lets you deal with the audio data in a way that is based on its content. To use the parser, you must give it callback routines that can deal with the subcode changes that interest you. Then you set up a loop that reads DAT frames from the DAT and calls the parser for each DAT frame. ID="Media2-7DAT17"The parser checks the subcode in every submitted DAT frame. If the parts of the subcode you care about have changed from the previous DAT frame, the parser executes one of your callbacks and hands it the new subcode information. Within your callback, you can examine the subcode information and change the state of your application as needed. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="73715"Opening and Closing the DAT Device for AudioThe DAT device driver is a standard IRIX device, so you can use the generic ID="Media2-7DAT18"open()ID="Media2-7DAT19", ID="Media2-7DAT20"close(), and ID="Media2-7DAT21"ioctl() calls that you would use for any other tape device; however, unlike a standard tape drive, the DAT drive has an audio mode in addition to a straight data mode.ID="Media2-7DAT22"To put the DAT drive in audio mode, use ID="Media2-7DAT23"ioctl() with MTIOCTOP and an ID="Media2-7DAT24"mtop type structure, but set the mt_count member of the mtop structure to 1 before submitting that mtop structure to ioctl(). For example:struct mtop mt_com;
mt_com.mt_op = MTAUD;
mt_com.mt_count = 1; /* 1 == audio mode, 0 == data mode */
ioctl(fd, MTIOCTOP, &mt_com);LBL="" HELPID=""ID="98073"Navigating through a DATTo move through a DAT tape, you use ID="Media2-7DAT25"ioctl(), a standard IRIX system call. But before you can call ID="Media2-7DAT26"ioctl(), you need to know where you are going. For most applications, destinations can come from either of two sources, the end user or calculations internal to your application. Destinations from the end user come to your application in the form of ASCII strings. Destinations from internal calculations typically come in the form of a DAT frame count or, sometimes, as four values that specify the location in terms of hours, minutes, seconds, and DAT frames. Unfortunately, these forms are not suitable for seeking, so you must convert them before you can use them. LBL="" HELPID=""Getting DAT Locations from the End UserIf your application wants to give end users the option of seeking to a DAT location defined in terms of time, your application can prompt the user for the time and then call ID="Media2-7DAT27"DTatotime() to convert the string to a time code that you can submit to ID="Media2-7DAT28"ioctl() for seeking.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting DAT Locations from Calculations Internal to Your ApplicationGenerally, the pure DAT frame count is the most convenient format to use when comparing two locations.ID="Media2-7DAT29"To convert to pure DAT frame counts, call: COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"DTtctoframe()ID="Media2-7DAT30"LEFT="125" WIDTH="216"to extract a pure DAT frame count from a

countYou can then make your calculations and call DTframetotc() to convert the DAT frame count to a time code suitable for seeking.It is also possible to make comparisons between locations expressed in terms of hours, minutes, seconds, and DAT frames. In that case, you can convert all locations into hours, minutes, seconds, DAT frames format by calling:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="126"DTatohmsf()LEFT="135" WIDTH="207"to convert an ASCII string to hours, minutes,

Program numbers range from 001 to 799. The pno1 member contains the most significant digit and pn3 contains the least significant digit. Thus, to seek to program 578, set the pn* members as follows:struct mtaudio AudioProgNum;

AudioProgNum.pn1 = 5;
AudioProgNum.pn2 = 7;
AudioProgNum.pn3 = 8;To seek to a location on the tape defined in terms of time, set the mtaudioseektype member to MTAUDPOSN_ABS, MTAUDPOSN_RUN, or MTAUDPOSN_PTIME and then specify the time location in the mtaudio members: atimefor MTAUDPOSN_ABSrtimefor MTAUDPOSN_RUNptimefor MTAUDPOSN_PTIMEThese atime, rtime, and ptime members contain structures of type mtaudtimecode:struct mtaudtimecode {
    unchar hhi:4, hlo:4; /* hours */
    unchar mhi:4, mlo:4; /* minutes */
    unchar shi:4, slo:4; /* seconds */
    unchar fhi:4, flo:4; /* DAT frame # */
};The hhi and hlo members expect two digits that specify the hour to which you want to seek. The valid range for these two digits is from 00 to 99. The mhi and mhl expect the two digits that specify the minute to which you want to seek. The valid range for these two digits if from 00 to 59. The shi and slo expect the two digits that specify the second to which you want to seek. The valid range for these two digits is from 00 to 59. The fhi and fhl expect the two digits that specify the DAT frame to which you want to seek. The valid range for these two digits is from 00 to 33.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="37686"Using the DAT DriveThis section explains how to use the DAT Audio Library routines for:ID="Media2-7DAT37"playing a DATrecording a DATreading and writing audio data from a DATparsing DAT informationcommunicating DAT status to the end userLBL="" HELPID=""Playing a Tape in the DAT DrivePlaying audio from a DAT is a little more complicated than playing a CD. For example, the sample rate for all CDs is 44.1 kHz; however, DAT audio may have been recorded at a sampling rate of 48 kHz, 44.1 kHz, or 32 kHz. Fortunately, a DAT records its sampling rate in the subcodes at the start of the tape, so you can read this sampling rate from the DAT before you must write DAT audio samples to the audio port.ID="Media2-7DAT38"In outline, a simple DAT-playing application must:Define a callback routine for dt_sampfreq. When the parser calls this routine, it passes in the frequency just read from the tape. Your callback should set a global variable to the frequency it gets from the parser. (See the DTaddcallback(3) man page.) Define a callback routine for dt_audio. When the parser calls this routine, it passes in the audio data from the DAT frame just parsed. The callback routine should write this data to the audio port using the sampling rate set by the dt_sampfreq callback. Open the audio port.Open the DAT drive. Create a parser. Add your dt_sampfreq and dt_audio callbacks to the parser. Read samples from the DAT. Parse the samples. Write the samples to an audio port using the Audio Library.When the application first starts reading the tape, it sees the frequency, calls your dt_sampfreq callback, and hands it the sampling frequency. As the parser continues to parse DAT frames, it also sees the audio data and executes your dt_audio callback for each new DAT frame containing audio. For an example of a simple program that plays a tape in the DAT drive, see IDREF="75008" TYPE="TITLE""DAT Sample Program". For more information on using the audio port, see IDREF="70508" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 6, "Programming with the Audio Library."LBL="" HELPID=""Making DAT Recordings for Playback on the DAT DriveWhen making recordings on DAT recorders that you want to play on a Silicon Graphics DAT drive, you must make sure you record at least one of the time codes. Most recorders will let you record audio without any time codes, so be certain you record the time codes. Record in standard mode; the DAT drive does not support long play (LP) mode or 4-channel (4CH) mode tapes.ID="Media2-7DAT39"LBL="" HELPID=""Reading Audio Data from the DAT Drive To read audio data from the DAT drive, you need to open the DAT drive and put it in audio mode. Then you can call the standard IRIX ID="Media2-7DAT40"read() system call as you would for any other tape device. The only complicating factor is that you need to ensure that you read complete DAT frames. This is not particularly difficult if you declare your receiving buffer to be an array of ID="Media2-7DAT41"DTFRAME structures. For example:DTFRAME MyDATbuffer[4];declares a buffer of four DTFRAME structures. If you then do a read such as:n = read( MyDATtapeDevice, MyDATbuffer, sizeof(MyDATbuffer) );you read in complete DAT frames and can easily access those complete DAT frames when you want to parse them. LBL="" HELPID=""Writing Audio Data to the DAT DriveTo write audio data to the DAT drive, you need to open the DAT drive and put it in audio mode. Then you can call the standard IRIX ID="Media2-7DAT42"write() system call as you would for any other tape device. Writing the tape is just a matter of writing DAT frames to the tape. But setting the contents of the DAT frames is not just a matter of gathering together your audio samples. You must write subcode information that specifies things such as the sampling rate at which the audio was recorded. You must also update the DAT time code for each DAT frame that you write to the tape. To help you set the subcode information for the DAT frames you want to write, libdataudio contains these routines:DTsetdate()to set a date pack to the current time (useful for timestamps)ID="Media2-7DAT43"DTinctime()to increment a DAT time codeID="Media2-7DAT44"DTtcvalid()to check that a time code is valid (use it after calling DTinctime())For more information on the time code routines, see the appropriate man pages. For information on what you can write into the DAT frame subcodes, see the DTFRAME(4) man page. For additional information about properly writing DAT subcodes, see the DAT specification.LBL="" HELPID=""Ensuring that your DAT Recording Is Recognized as AudioThe DAT drive determines whether a tape is audio by looking for valid audio DAT frames. These frames must contain at least one valid time code field (absolute time, run time, or program time). When making recordings on DAT recorders that you want to later play on the Silicon Graphics DAT drive, you must make sure you record one of these time codes and that you record in standard mode.LBL="" HELPID=""Recording the DAT Lead-in AreaThe DAT specification requires that a tape begin with a special lead-in area of 100 DAT frames. Recording 100 frames ensures that the real recording will not begin over the plastic leader on the tape.ID="Media2-7DAT45"The following procedure provides the proper lead-in area:create an empty DTFRAMEset the program number contained in the DAT frame to 0x0BB (beginning-of-tape, or BOT, code) set the START bit in the control IDset the subcode packs to 0x0AA (readable, not valid)fill the audio data block with zerosrewind the tape and repeatedly write the DAT frame at least 100 timesLBL="" HELPID=""Recording Digital Audio over Digital Data Storage (DDS) TapesID="Media2-7DAT46"This section explains special precautions that must be taken when recording audio onto a tape that has previously been used as a data (DDS) tape.When you insert a DDS tape into the DAT drive, it is rewound to the logical beginning-of-tape (BOT). On data tapes, the logical BOT differs from the physical BOT by approximately 10 centimeters (30 seconds). If you attempt to write data to the drive in audio mode, writing begins at the logical BOT. When you then rewind and play this tape, there is an initial 30-second gap before playback starts. If the tape is removed and then reinserted into a DAT drive, it is recognized as a data tape because DDS format data exists between the physical BOT and the DDS logical BOT.NoteWith the current DAT drives (firmware revision 2.63), the following procedure is necessary to work around the problem: Check to see if the tape in the drive is DDS media and at BOT. If so, switch the drive to audio mode and write a frame of data to move the tape off logical BOT, and then issue a rewind. This rewinds the tape all the way back to the physical BOT. ID="Media2-7DAT47"LBL="" HELPID=""Example Programs Demonstrating DAT RecordingTwo sample programs are available to help you with DAT recording:ID="Media2-7DAT48"APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/cd+dat/cdtodat.c" PARMS=""cdtodat.c, in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/cd+datThis program copies audio from a CD to a DAT. It contains example code for recording to DAT, including handling of the lead-in area and recording over data tapes. APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/cd+dat/verifydat.c" PARMS=""verifydat.c, in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/cd+datThis program verifies that a DAT has been recorded correctly and has continuously running absolute time code. LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling the DAT ParserAfter you have read in data from a DAT, you can start to process it. Typically, how you process the audio data depends on what its associated subcodes tell you about the data (for example, the sample rate at which the audio was recorded). If you want, you can directly examine the subcode associated with each DAT frame and respond appropriately. ID="Media2-7DAT49"The DTFRAME structure, however, is large and complicated and subject to change. libdataudio includes a parser so that your application can avoid dealing with the ID="Media2-7DAT50"DTFRAME structure directly. If you write a loop that passes all the read DAT frames through the parser, the parser can examine all the DAT frames for changes in the subcode. When the parser finds a change (seeing a subcode for the first time counts as a change), it executes the appropriate callback routinename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'depending on what sort of subcode change occurredname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'and passes the new subcode data into your callback routine. The DAT parser distinguishes among 14 categories of subcode information. Thus, if you are interested in subcode changes for only one category of subcode data, the parser does not bother your application with subcode changes that you consider irrelevant. LBL="" HELPID=""Allocating and Initializing the DAT ParserTo allocate and initialize the data structures for the DAT parser, you must call ID="Media2-7DAT51"ID="Media2-7DAT52"DTcreateparser().To reset the parser after the user changes the tape in the DAT drive, call DTresetparser().ID="Media2-7DAT53" This clears out any information the parser has about the last DAT frame but leaves the callback routines in place. LBL="" HELPID=""Defining Callbacks for the DAT ParserWhen you define a callback for the parser, you must write a function of the form:My_dat_SomethingCallBack( void* arg, DTDATATYPES type,
void* data)
{ 
/* your code here */
}The parser uses the third parameter to pass in information it read from the subcodes. The parser uses the second parameter to pass in the type of callback it thinks it is calling. You can use this to assign the same function to different types of callbacks. Internally, you can switch on the type. This feature is useful if two callbacks are the same except for a few lines. The parser does not use the first parameter. You can use that to pass in information if your application needs to call the callback directly. LBL="" HELPID=""Adding and Removing DAT Parser Callbacks To add callback routines to the parser, call ID="Media2-7DAT54"ID="Media2-7DAT55"DTaddcallback(). If you do not specify a callback for a category, the parser assumes you are not interested in changes of that type.You can add callbacks that respond to changes in any of the following categories of subcode data:dt_audiocallbacks respond to changes in the audio data in a DAT frame. You can use this class of callback to notify you when you have gotten past the lead-in track and have started to see audio samples. When the parser calls this routine, it passes in the audio sample data. If this callback routine is a play routine for your application, it should write the audio sample to an audio port using the Audio Library. See the ALwritesamps(3) man page and IDREF="70508" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 6, "Programming with the Audio Library."dt_pnumcallbacks respond to changes in the program number. You can use this callback to notice when you have moved from one program (track) to the next. dt_indexcallbacks respond to changes in the index number. You can use this callback to notice when you have moved from one subsection of a track to the next.dt_ptimecallbacks respond to changes in the program time. You can use this callback to continuously update a "program time display" in a DAT-playing application. dt_atimecallbacks respond to changes in the absolute time elapsed since the start of the DAT. You can use this callback to continuously update your application's information about total elapsed time.dt_rtimecallbacks respond to changes in the run time elapsed since the start of a recording on the DAT.

You can use any Apple Macintosh“ compatible serial-to-MIDI converter. Many MIDI converters include additional features, including SMPTE-to-MIDI conversion (which is useful for synchronizing MIDI to tape and film), and built-in MIDI patchbays for switching between multiple MIDI inputs and outputs. You should choose your serial-to-MIDI converter based on the functionality you expect your users to require.ID="Media2-8MI3"ID="Media2-8MI4"ID="Media2-8MI5"Once you have selected a MIDI converter, you will need some MIDI devices to attach to it. The kind and number of MIDI devices you choose to create your MIDI network depends largely on the scope of the application you are writing and your budget. A single keyboard synthesizer may be sufficient for your needs if you are writing a very simple sequencer, but for more complex programs, you should have a keyboard, several rack-mount synthesizer modules, an alternate MIDI controller (such as a wind controller), and a mixer with enough channels for all the instruments you have (so you can hear the results).ID="Media2-8MI6"ID="Media2-8MI7"If you are not satisfied with listening through headphones or through your workstation's internal speaker, you should probably invest in an amplifier and/or a pair of powered speakers. A multi-track tape recorder may also be useful for testing your application if it will ultimately be used for recording music. You should plan on testing your application using the kind of equipment that you anticipate the end users of your application to have.IDREF="30028" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 10-1 shows one possible MIDI setup.FILE="MIDInet.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="10-1"Figure 10-1 ID="30028"MIDI SetupLBL="" HELPID=""ID="42578"Connecting Devices to MIDI I/O InterfacesThe MIDI Library is currently supported on the Indigo, IndigoID="Media2-8MI8"2, and Indy workstations.

MIDI information is transmitted in the form of an event: a control instruction (or message), combined with time information (called a timestamp). Typical messages are ID="Media2-8MI13"note on and note off (describing the beginning and ending time of a certain musical note) and values for continuous controllers such as sustain pedals, modulation wheels, and pitch bend controllers. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="94782"Initializing MIDI Library ProgramsBefore calling any MD Library routines, you must initialize the MIDI Library by calling mdInit(), which returns the number of available MIDI ports. If the MIDI daemon is not running, mdInit() returns -1. See IDREF="89257" TYPE="TITLE""Configuring Serial Ports for MIDI WIth the Port Setup Tool" for instructions on configuring the serial ports and starting and stopping the MIDI daemon.LBL="" HELPID=""Compiling and Linking MIDI Library ProgramsTo compile a MIDI Library program, enter:cc ≠g MLsample.c -o MLsample ≠lmdYou should also link with any other libraries, such as the Audio Library, that your application uses.LBL="" HELPID=""MIDI Library Error HandlingAll libmd functions return -1 on error, and set oserror(3C) appropriately.LBL="" HELPID=""MIDI Library Programming ModelThe MIDI Library has two basic data structures:MDportAn opaque structure containing information about the state of MIDI data and timing, as well as the state of all options for the port.MDeventA public structure containing fields for regular and system-exclusive MIDI messages, timestamps, and message lengths.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="17828"Opening and Closing MIDI PortsThe MDport, or MIDI port, is the basic MIDI I/O structure in the MIDI Library. An MDport provides a one-way (input-only or output-only) connection to a MIDI device. Each port can transmit or receive on as many as 32 independent MIDI channels, 16 per serial port. The use of separate MIDI channels allows complex orchestration of MIDI instruments, when each MIDI device is "tuned" to a different channel.ID="Media2-8MI14"ID="Media2-8MI15"LBL="" HELPID=""Getting the Name of an Available MIDI PortOnce the MIDI Library has been initialized by calling mdInit(), you can get the name of an available port by calling mdGetName():char *mdGetName(int portno)Then you can build a menu of available MIDI ports for your application. mdGetName() returns the name string associated with portno or NULL, if portno does not refer to an existing port. For example, if MIDI has been initialized with the following command:startmidi -n ttyd2 -d /dev/ttyd2mdInit() returns 1, and mdGetName(0) returns the "ttyd2" string. LBL="" HELPID=""Opening and Closing MIDI Input and Output PortsThe MIDI Library has task-specific calls for opening MDports: mdOpenInPort() opens an input port and mdOpenOutPort() opens an output port. Their function prototypes are:MDport mdOpenInPort(char *name)
MDport mdOpenOutPort(char *name)Each returns a handle to the appropriate type of port.Use the name returned by mdGetName() to indicate a particular MIDI device to which a port is to be connected, as demonstrated in IDREF="53937" TYPE="TEXT"Example 10-1.LBL="10-1"Example 10-1 ID="53937"Opening MIDI Input and Output Ports#include "dmedia/md.h"

}The initial state of a newly-opened port is undefined, except for the timestamping mode, which is MD_DELTASTAMP.You can open up to 64 MDports, less the number of devices. For example, if you have both serial ports configured for MIDI, you can open 62 MDports. When a port is no longer needed, call mdClosePort() to close the port and free its associated resources.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="39235"Programming MIDI I/OThis section explains how to implement the most basic tasks for MIDI applications: sending and receiving MIDI messages.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="32768"Hands-On MIDI Output ExperienceTo begin, try playing a sound through the MIDI equipment connected to your system. The sample application plays a sound by sending a MIDI message. To test whether you can send MIDI output, try this:If you have not already done so, connect your MIDI equipment to your workstation's serial port, and configure the port for MIDI, as described in IDREF="42578" TYPE="TITLE""Connecting Devices to MIDI I/O Interfaces".Click on APP="/usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/midi/simple/scale" PARMS=""scale
 to launch the scale program, which sends a musical scale through the MIDI output.NoteThe application will not launch if you don't have your MIDI equipment connected and set up.See APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/midi/simple/scale.c" PARMS=""scale.c
, in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/midi/simple to view the code that plays the musical scale.A tone is played through the MIDI output by specifying the note to play and its duration, and then sending a note on event to sound the tone, followed by another event to end the sound (often, a note on with zero velocity is used to silence a note).IDREF="45511" TYPE="TEXT"Example 10-2 shows the playnote() routine from scale.c, which creates a MIDI event structure (mdEvent) named mdv. The mdv structure contains a 3-byte message, a timestamp, and the message length. The 3-part message consists of the MD_NOTEON event, or'ed to a channel, followed by the note and its velocity. See IDREF="26449" TYPE="TITLE""About MIDI Events" for a description of the mdEvent structure.The message is given an initial timestamp of 0. After the specified time interval has elapsed, the note's velocity is set to zero and then a zero velocity note on message is sent to silence the output.LBL="10-2"Example 10-2 ID="45511"Sending a MIDI Message#include "dmedia/midi.h"

    int msglen;              /* length of data, sysex only */
} mdEvent;msgis an array of characters representing the data of a non-system-exclusive message, which can include status, note, and controller information and is from 1 to 3 bytes in length.sysexmsgis a pointer to a string of characters representing a block of system-exclusive (SYSEX) data, which can include bulk data such as instrument patch configuration parameters and can be of arbitrary length. When SYSEX data is received, msg[0] is set to MD_SysEx (0xf0), and then the actual data storage is allocated with mdMalloc(); similarly, it must be released with mdFree().stampis the timestamp of the event, in nanoseconds or in ticks, if you are using one of the tick modes.msglenis used by system-exclusive messages to indicate the length of the SYSEX packet, or when sending multiple messages in a single event. For single events, msglen should be set to 0.The timestamp for the MIDI event, which is the time at which the event did or should occur, is reckoned from either a fixed time or the previous event's time. The MIDI Library supports two types of timestamping:relativeID="Media2-8MI16"stamping, in which time is reckoned for all events as an interval from an initial specified time. This is useful for sequencers.delta stamping, in which time for each individual event is reckoned as the interval since the last event occurred. This is useful for insertions of events in lists.See IDREF="18137" TYPE="TITLE""Controlling MIDI Timing" for information about setting the timestamping mode and other parameters.LBL="" HELPID=""Sending and Receiving MIDI EventsThis section explains how to send and receive MIDI events.LBL="" HELPID=""Sending MIDI EventsTo send a MIDI event from a MIDI output port, call mdSend(). Its function prototype is:int mdSend(MDport port, MDevent *buf, int count)Depending on the port's timestamping mode, MIDI events have either relative or delta timestamps, or no timestamps at all. If temporal buffering is used, mdSend() blocks, waiting for the output to catch up, until the amount of time represented by the sum of the timestamps in the event buffer exceeds the timeout value set by mdSetTemporalBuffering().If no errors occur, mdSend() returns the number of messages successfully sent; otherwise, it returns either 0, indicating that an error occurred and no messages were sent, or -1 times the number of messages not sent. mdSend() sleeps if the output queue size limit is exceeded.LBL="" HELPID=""Receiving MIDI EventsTo receive a MIDI event into a MIDI input port, call mdReceive(). Its function prototype is:int mdReceive(MDport port, MDevent *buf, int count)mdReceive() allocates storage for messages coming into the designated port, except for system-exclusive messages; these require the application to allocate and free the necessary storage. mdReceive() copies the message(s) and timestamp(s) into a buffer, and returns either the number of messages read from the given port or -1, if an error occurred.LBL="" HELPID=""Handling System-Exclusive MIDI EventsSYSEX messages are received in chunks of up to 1 kilobyte. To check for SYSEX messages, scan for the EOX marker in buf.sysexmsg[buf.msglen-1]. When receiving sysex messages, buf.msg[0] is set to 0xf0 for each chunk received, while the actual data is stored in buf.sysexmsg.LBL="" HELPID=""Printing MIDI EventsTo print the messages in the MIDI event buffer, you must first convert them to a human-readable format by calling mdPrintEvent(). Its function prototype is:int mdPrintEvent(char *buf, mdEvent *evbuf, int count)bufis a pointer to buffer allocated by the application. It should be large enough to contain the formatted representation of all the events in evbuf. Eighty bytes per message is sufficient.evbufis a pointer to the event buffercountis the number of events to formatThe message format is:timestamp : channel : status type (string) : byte 1 : byte 2If the message is a note on or note off, then the note name (for example, A3) is printed in the field occupied by byte 1; otherwise, the numeric value is printed.LBL="" HELPID=""Processing MIDI Event MessagesA MIDI message is an array of 2 or 3 bytes.

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="18137"Controlling MIDI TimingThe MIDI Library provides for timed input and output of MIDI data. Messages are timestamped on input and are scheduled for output on the basis of their timestamp. Output scheduling can be disabled.You can synchronize I/O for MIDI streams with other media streams by correlating timestamps in terms of unadjusted system time (UST).LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling MIDI Timing ModeYou can choose to time MIDI events using either actual time or musical beats, also called ticks. The default mode of an MDport is delta timestamping, which measures the time elapsed from the previous event, but you can reset it to use any mode. To get a port's timestamping mode, call mdGetStampMode(); to set a port's timestamping mode, call mdSetStampMode().The MIDI Library has three modes in which timing is controlled by actual time:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"MD_NOSTAMPLEFT="115" WIDTH="225"Causes the output timestamps to be ignored. 
Input timestamps are undefined.LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"MD_DELTASTAMPLEFT="115" WIDTH="225"Causes each input event to be timestamped with 
the number of milliseconds from the previous 
event, and interprets output timestamps in the 
same way.LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"MD_RELATIVESTAMPLEFT="115" WIDTH="225"Causes input timestamps to be marked relative to 
a time specified by mdSetOrigin(). Output 
timestamps are also reckoned against the same 
origin time.The MIDI Library has two modes in which timing is controlled by beats:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="108"MD_RELATIVETICKSLEFT="115" WIDTH="225"Allows the ticks to be reckoned from an origin 
time that is set with mdSetOrigin().LEFT="0" WIDTH="108"MD_DELTATICKSLEFT="115" WIDTH="225"Uses simple delta timestamps. Ticks are defined in 
terms compatible with Standard MIDI files; for 
example, pulses per quarter note (PPQ). Ticks are 
controlled by mdSetTempo() and 
mdSetDivision().Time is measured from the time the MDport was opened. You can reset the reference time by calling mdSetOrigin(), which sets the start time to the 64-bit UST that you specify. The result depends on the value used:0Sets the start time to the system's current UST.< 0Sets the start time to the number of nanoseconds before the current UST. This allows streams of files to be restarted in the middle of the data> USTSets the start time to some time in the future.Upon successful completion, mdSetOrigin returns 0; otherwise it returns ≠1 and sets an error code that you can retrieve with oserror(3C). To get the start time, call mdGetOrigin().Setting the reference time to match a UST value is useful in MIDI recording, for setting the recording start time to correspond to the arrival of an audio signal at the input jacks. See IDREF="62110" TYPE="TITLE""Hands-On MIDI and Audio Synchronization Experience" for a demonstration of this technique.LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling MIDI TempoYou can vary the tempo for ports whose timestamping mode is in ticks. Tempo is expressed in microseconds per beat, as in Standard MIDI Files (SMF). Tempo and division values specify the conversion from MIDI clock ticks to real time values for the MIDI driver. Divisions represent the subsamples per beat, or pulses per quarter note (PPQ). This is useful for MIDI sequencing. To set the tempo, call mdSetTempo(); to get the tempo, call mdGetTempo().To set the divisions per beat (pulses per quarter note), call mdSetDivision(); to get the divisions per beat, call mdGetDivision().To convert a timestamp from ticks to nanoseconds, taking into account the port's tempo, call mdTicksToNanos(). Similarly, to convert from nanoseconds to ticks, call mdNanosToTicks().Sometimes you need to adjust the tempo when audio is not synchronized or to compensate for a slow tape deck when recording MIDI. You can specify a tempo scale factor by calling mdSettemposcale(). When messages whose timestamps are expressed in ticks are written to a port that has a tempo scale factor, the timestamps are multiplied by the scale factor before being queued for output. This allows for nondestructive tempo matching.LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling MIDI Output BufferingThe MIDI driver buffers data according to time. An application that responds to user interaction must compensate for the fact that events can be sent to the MIDI port faster than they can actually be transmitted. By default, the MIDI library does not allow a process to get more than 2 seconds ahead of the actual output.You can control how much playback can get ahead of data transmission by specifying the amount of temporal buffering. To set the number of milliseconds an application can get ahead of its output, that is, the time to drain an MDport, call mdSetTemporalBuffering(). When the event timestamps exceed the specified timeout value, mdSend() sleeps until the output catches up.To determine the amount of time an application can get ahead of its output, call mdGetTemporalBuffering().You can pause output momentarily or even completely silence output when necessary.To stop pending output on a port and return the UST value or the tick of the last message sent to or from a port, call mdPause(). mdPause() immediately halts output.Sometimes you may need to do more than simply pause the output. You can send a panic event for a given port by calling mdPanic(), which sends an all notes off message and a reset controllers message on each channel.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="60416"Hands-On MIDI File Player ExperienceThe MIDI file player sample application illustrates the use of the timing concepts presented in this sectionname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'it lets the user change the tempo of a MIDI file, pause playback, or drag a slider to start playback at a random location.To play MIDI files using the MIDI file player:If you have not already done so, connect your MIDI equipment to your workstation's serial port, and configure the port for MIDI, as described in IDREF="42578" TYPE="TITLE""Connecting Devices to MIDI I/O Interfaces".Click on APP="/usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/midi/Mfp" PARMS=""Mfp

, in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/midi/mfp to view the playback source code.The MIDI file player application uses three threads: one to manage the user interface (UI), one to manage the playback, and one to update the song position. These threads use shared memory; semaphores are used to protect critical regions so that both processes don't try to access the same data simultaneously.The playback thread waits on the semaphore. Processes that are waiting on a semaphore are queued on a first-come, first-served basis. When the UI process acquires the semaphore, playback stops; when it releases the semaphore, playback starts. An important point to note is that the playback loop uses uscpsema(), which tests the semaphore and returns immediately if it can't be acquired. This provides an opportunity where it is known to be safe to pause the output. Without doing this, it is possible to send the pause command without having the playback thread acknowledge it, because it is busy sending data.Another interesting point to note is that error checking is performed to determine whether the application is sending more data than can be handled; if so, the playback thread releases the semaphore and polls the MIDI port until enough data has drained to allow more data to be sent.The song position thread loops until either the stop button is hit or the song finishes. If a sequence is paused, the position resets to 0, so you need to save the starting position, then add it back in when resuming playback.The MIDI file player uses non-blocking I/O so that stopping a sequence is possible without flushing currently queued data. If mdSend() is waiting for either room or time to send data, that data is sent as soon as the currently waiting data is flushed.When setting the division and tempo, the division must always be set first, because the constants set in the driver by the tempo change, depending on the division.When setting the origin time, putting the position of the file in a signed   quantity avoids a compiler warning. Multiplying the start time by -1 allows the file to start playing in the middle without waiting for the first timestamp to expire.When pausing playback, keep track of the timestamp of the MIDI message that was most recently sent and add it to the previous pause time, so that playback will resume from the proper location in the file.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="42349"Synchronizing MIDI I/O with Other MediaYou can synchronize I/O for MIDI streams with other media streams by correlating timestamps in terms of unadjusted system time (UST).One technique is to set the MIDI port to use relative timestamping, and then use mdSetOrigin() to set the port's origin time to match the UST of the media stream to which you want to synchronize.Alternatively, you can obtain the UST for a MIDI event and compare it to the UST of another media stream counter. To return the UST or tick of the last event sent out, call mdTell().LBL="" HELPID=""ID="62110"Hands-On MIDI and Audio Synchronization ExperienceTo try a synchronized audio and MIDI application:If you have not already done so, connect your MIDI equipment to your workstation's serial port, and configure the port for MIDI, as described in IDREF="42578" TYPE="TITLE""Connecting Devices to MIDI I/O Interfaces".Click on APP="/usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/midi/syncrecord/recordmidi" PARMS=""syncrecord

For more detail about a particular term, see the Glossary included in this guide.Video differs from computer graphics in these ways:interlacingbroadcast standardscolor encodingvideo signalstape formatsLBL="" HELPID=""ID="96608"InterlacingUnlike the way the screen is typically drawn for computer graphics, most video signals are ID="Media3-1VB1"interlaced: each time the video screen is refreshed, only half of the horizontal lines are drawn. That is, each frame is composed of two fields.During one screen refresh, the video monitor draws the first field, which contains all the odd-numbered lines; during the next refresh, it draws the second field, which contains all the even-numbered lines. Therefore, two refresh cycles are required to draw one frame. ID="Media3-1VB2"The display rate of interlaced video signals can be measured either in terms of field rate, or refresh rate, or in terms of frame rate, which equals half of the field rate, because each frame contains two fields.ID="Media3-1VB3"IDREF="37367" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 11-1 shows a frame and its two fields for NTSC, the broadcast standard used in North America and some other parts of the world.FILE="Media3-1VB.cgm" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="11-1"Figure 11-1 ID="37367"Fields and FrameID="Media3-1VB4"In contrast, the Silicon Graphics workstation monitor is typically noninterlaced: it draws every line each time it refreshes the screen. Refresh rates vary, depending on the type of monitor your Silicon Graphics workstation has. The video output capability of the graphics subsystem for some Silicon Graphics workstation models supports interlaced monitor formats, including component RGB at 525 and 625 lines per frame.ID="Media3-1VB5"LBL="" HELPID=""Broadcast StandardsBroadcast standards, or video timing formats, are ways of encoding video information for broadcast to television receivers. These standards are also used to describe the display capabilities of video monitors and are thus also called video timing formats or video output formats (VOFs). The three broadcast standards are:ID="Media3-1VB6"ID="Media3-1VB7"NTSCID="Media3-1VB8"Named after the National Television Systems Committee, which developed it, this standard is used in all of North and South America, except Brazil, and in much of East Asia. PAL ID="Media3-1VB9"(Phase Alternated by Line) This standard is used in western Europe, including the United Kingdom but excluding France, and in East Asia, including Australia. SECAM ID="Media3-1VB10"(Sequentiel Couleur avec Memoire) This standard is used in France, eastern Europe, the Near East and Mideast, and parts of Africa and the Caribbean.NoteNTSC implementations can vary slightly by country; PAL and SECAM implementations can vary considerably. NTSC employs a total of 525 horizontal lines per frame, with two fields per frame of 262.5 lines each. Each field refreshes at 60Hz (actually 59.94Hz). NTSC encodes brightness, color, and synchronizing information in one signal.ID="Media3-1VB11"PAL employs a total of 625 horizontal lines per frame, with two fields per frame of 312.5 lines per frame. Each field refreshes at 50Hz. PAL encodes brightness, color, and synchronizing information in one signal also, but in a different way from NTSC. SECAM transmits the same number of lines at the same rate as PAL, but transmits each color difference signal on alternate lines, using the frequency modulation of the subcarrier.These numbers of horizontal linesname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

For NTSC, the first (odd) field starts with a whole line and ends with a half line; the second (even) field starts with a half line and ends with a whole line. Each NTSC field contains 242.5 active lines and 20 lines of vertical blanking. Similarly, for PAL, the first (even) field starts with a half line and ends with a whole line; the second (odd) field starts with a whole line and ends with a half line. Each PAL field contains 287.5 active lines and 25 lines of vertical blanking.In each case, the numbers 525 and 625 refer to transmitted lines; the active video lines are fewername='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'typically, 485 for NTSC and 575 for PAL. The remaining lines are used for delimiting frame boundaries and for synchronization and other information.To minimize frame flickering and reduce the bandwidth of the video signal, the active video lines are interlaced, as explained earlier in this chapter.NTSC and PAL can be recorded digitally; these recording techniques are referred to as D2 525 (digital NTSC) and D2 625 (digital PAL).ID="Media3-1VB12"ID="Media3-1VB13"ID="Media3-1VB14"ID="Media3-1VB15"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="21423"Color EncodingColor-encoding methods are:ID="Media3-1VB16"RGB (component)YUV (component)YIQ (component)YC (separate luminance (Y) and chrominance (C)), YC-358, YC-443, S-Videocomposite videoLBL="" HELPID=""RGBID="Media3-1VB17"RGB is the color-encoding method used by most graphics computers, as well as some professional-quality video cameras.

LBL="" HELPID=""YUVID="Media3-1VB18"YUV, a form of which is used by the PAL video standard and by Betacam and D1 cameras and VCRs, is also a component color-encoding method, but in a different way from RGB. In this case, brightness, or luminance, is carried on a signal known as Y, and color, or chrominance, is carried on the U and V signals. The two chrominance signals U and V are two-phase amplitude-modulated: the U component modulates the subcarrier at an angle of 0 degrees, but the V component modulates it at 90 degrees or 180 degrees on alternate lines. The color burst is also line-alternated at +135 and -135 degrees relative to the U signal.

In this system, which is sometimes referred to as Y/R-Y/B-Y, R-Y corresponds to CR and V, and B-Y corresponds to CB and U. R-Y and B-Y are obtained by subtracting luminance (Y) from the red (R) and blue (B) camera signals, respectively.

NoteThe range of VL capabilities you can use depends on the capabilities of your workstation and the video options installed in it.Topics in this chapter include:IDREF="75341" TYPE="TEXT"VL FeaturesIDREF="13279" TYPE="TEXT"VL System Software ArchitectureIDREF="89470" TYPE="TEXT"VL Architectural Model of Video DevicesIDREF="93349" TYPE="TEXT"VL Programming ModelIDREF="28051" TYPE="TEXT"Opening a Connection to the Video Daemon and Setting up a Data PathIDREF="73892" TYPE="TEXT"Setting Parameters for Data Transfer to or from MemoryIDREF="92003" TYPE="TEXT"Displaying Video Data OnscreenIDREF="82124" TYPE="TEXT"Transferring Video Data to and from DevicesIDREF="37265" TYPE="TEXT"Ending Data TransferThe chapter concludes with example code illustrating a simple screen application and frame grabs (video to memory, memory to video, and continuous frame capture).LBL="" HELPID=""ID="75341"VL FeaturesLBL="" HELPID=""ID="87942"How the VL Works with HardwareThe VL includes calls for querying features of all supported Silicon Graphics video options. The VL supports conversion from one video format to another (for example, YUV to RGB or RGB to YUV).In some cases, the VL can support multiple devices of the same or of different types. For example, the CHALLENGEID="Media3-2GS3"‘ architecture supports multiple Sirius Video boards; Indy supports its built-in video (VINO) and the Indy Video option.ID="Media3-2GS4"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="19241"How the VL Works with Other SoftwareThe Video Library works with other Silicon Graphics libraries, such as the OpenGL, the IRIS GL and the IRIS ImageVision Library (IL). Software supplied with optional video hardware provides additional video capabilities through extensions to the VL. For example, Sirius Video software includes controls specific to that hardware.The VL allows programs to get events 60 times per second on a quiescent system; it also enables programs to share resources or to gain exclusive use of resources. It supports input and output of video data to or from locked-down memory at the nominal frame rate. Frame rate depends on the capabilities of the hardware you are using. NoteThe VL does not depend on the X Window System, but you can use X Window System libraries or toolkits to create a windowing interface.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="13279"VL System Software ArchitectureThis section describes features of these VL system components and tools:video daemongeneric video toolslibrary and header filesIDREF="12695" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 12-1 diagrams the interaction between the VL, the video daemon, the kernel, the hardware, and the X Window System server.

LBL="" HELPID=""Device ManagementManagement that the video daemon performs includes:ID="Media3-2GS7"multiple device managementSome hardware devices support multiple video products in one system. The video daemon is responsible for establishing and coordinating the availability of all video devices installed.multiple client access to multiple devicesThe library supports connections from multiple client applications and manages their access to a limited number of video devices.ID="Media3-2GS8"dispatching eventsAs events are handled and noted by devices, the daemon notifies applications that have expressed interest in those events.handling eventsAs events are generated by the various devices, the daemon initiates any action required by an event before it hands the event off to interested applications.maintaining exclusive useTypes of data or control usage for video clients in a Video Library application are Done Using, Read-only, Lock, and Shared. These usage levels apply only to write access on controls, not read access. Any application can open and read the control's values at any time.client cleanup on exitWhen a client exits or is terminated abnormally, its connection to the daemon is broken; the daemon performs any cleanup required of the system. Any exclusive-use modes that have been set are cleared; interested clients are notified that the device is no longer in exclusive use. Controls set by the client might persist, but are not guaranteed to remain after the client closes the connection.LBL="" HELPID=""Status InformationStatus information for which the video daemon is responsible includes:system status of video devicesThe video devices installed in a system can be queried as to availability and control status.video positioning (offset) informationcontrol setting and retrievalDevice-independent and device-dependent controls are set and retrieved through the video daemon.LBL="" HELPID=""Generic Video ToolsThe generic video tools include:ID="Media3-2GS9"videopanel (vcp)ID="Media3-2GS10"ID="Media3-2GS11"Use this graphical user interface to set controls, such as hue or contrast, on devices.

In most cases, the value being set takes precedence over other values that were previously set. For all devices, VL_PACKING must be set first. For VINO, set offset before size. Note that changes in one parameter may change the values of other parameters set earlier; for example, clipped size may change if VL_PACKING is set after VL_SIZE.To determine default values, use vlGetControl() to query the values on the video source or drain node before setting controls. The initial offset of the video node is the first active line of video.Similarly, the initial size value on the video source or drain node is the full size of active video being captured by the hardware, beginning at the default offset. Because some hardware can capture more than the size given by the video node, this value should be treated as a default size.For all these controls, it pays to track return codes. If the value returned is VLValueOutOfRange, the value set will not be what you requested.To specify the controls, use vlSetControl(), for which the function prototype is:int vlSetControl(VLServer vlServer, VLPath vlPath,                 VLNode node, VLControlType type,                 VLControlValue * value) 
ID="Media3-2GS27"The use of VL_FORMAT, VL_PACKING, VL_ZOOM, VL_SIZE, VL_OFFSET, VL_RATE, and VL_CAP_TYPE is explained in more detail in the following sections. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="48408"Using VL_FORMATTo specify video input and output formats of the video signal on the physical connector, use VL_FORMAT. Each video platform has a video format native to it; for example, YUV 4:2:2 is native to Galileo Video and RGB is native to Sirius Video. The native format is always the fastest for that platform. To discover the native format for your video platform, consult the release notes or other documentation for the product.NoteTo convert formats, use VL_PACKING, which is explained in the next section.When VL_FORMAT is applied to a source or drain that is a VL_MEM (memory) node, it selects the format of the video stored in memory. This may imply a software conversion of the video data after the transfer is completed.Values for VL_FORMAT for Galileo Video are:VL_FORMAT_RGB (output only)VL_FORMAT_BETACAM (input and output)VL_FORMAT_SMPTE_YUV (input and output)LBL="" HELPID=""Using VL_PACKINGTo convert a video output format to another in memory, use the control VL_PACKING.

Like other libraries in the IRIS digital media development environment, the VL uses ring buffers. Ring buffers provide a way to read and write varying sizes of frames of data. A frame of data consists of the actual frame data and an information structure describing the underlying data, including device-specific information. When a ring buffer is created, constraints are specified that control the total size of the data segment and the number of information buffers to allocate.A head and a tail flag are automatically set in a ring buffer so that the latest frame can be accessed. A sector is locked down if it is not called; that is, it remains locked until it is read. When the ring buffer is written to and all sectors are occupied, data transfer stops. The sector last written to remains locked down until it is released.The ring buffer can accommodate data of varying size. You can specify a ring buffer at a fixed size or can determine the size of the data in the buffer.To determine frame data size, use vlGetTransferSize(). Its function prototype is:long vlGetTransferSize(VLServer svr, VLPath path)For example:transfersize = vlGetTransferSize(svr, path); where transfersize is the size of the data in bytes.To create a ring buffer for the frame data, use vlCreateBuffer().

int vlCloseVideo(VLServer vlServer)This example ends a data transfer that used a buffer: vlEndTransfer(svr, path);vlDeregisterBuffer(svr, path, memnodeid, buffer);vlDestroyPath(svr, path);vlDestroyBuffer(svr, buffer);vlCloseVideo(svr);LBL="" HELPID=""VL ExamplesThe example code in this section illustrates:a simple screen applicationa video-to-memory frame grab a memory-to-video frame output a continuous frame capture Source code for these programs is in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/video/vl.NoteTo simplify the code, these examples do not check returns.

 char name[VL_NAME_SIZE]; /* name of control */
 VLControlType type; /* e.g. WINDOW, HUE */
 VLControlClass ctlClass; /* SLIDER, DETENT, KNOB, BUTTON */
 VLControlGroup group; /* BLEND, VISUAL QUALITY, SYNC */
 VLNode node; /* associated node */
 VLControlValueType valueType; /* what kind of data */
 int valueCount; /* how many data items */
 uint numFractRanges; /* number of ranges */
 VLFractionRange *ranges; /* range of values of control */

 uint numItems; /* number of enumerated items */
 VLControlItem *itemList; /* the actual enumerations */
} VLControlInfo;To store the value of different controls, libvl.a uses the struct:typedef union {
 VLFraction fractVal;
 VLBoolean boolVal;
 int intVal;
 VLXY xyVal;
 uint pad[24];
} VLControlValue;

typedef struct {
 int x, y;
} VLXY;

typedef struct {
 int numerator;
 int denominator;
} VLFraction;The control info structure is returned by a vlGetControlInfo() call, and it contains many of the items discussed above.VLControlInfo.number is the number of the VLControlInfo.node that the info pertains to. There may be several controls of the same type on a particular node, but usually there is just one.VLControlInfo.numFractRanges is the number of fraction ranges for a particular control. The names correspond 1-to-1 with the rangeNames, up to the number of range names, numRangeNames. That is, there may be fewer names than ranges, but never more.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="77682"VL Control Fraction RangesThe VL uses fraction ranges to represent the values possible for a control. A VLFractionRange generated by the VL is guaranteed never to generate a fraction with a zero denominator, or a fractional numerator or denominator. For a VLProgressionType of VL_LINEAR, numerator.increment and denominator.increment are guaranteed to be greater than zero, and the limit is always guaranteed to be {numerator,denominator}.base, plus some integral multiple of {numerator,denominator}.increment. The type definition for fraction types in the header file is: typedef struct {
    VLRange numerator;
    VLRange denominator;
} VLFractionRange;LBL="" HELPID=""ID="24371"VL Control ClassesThe VL defines control classes for user-interface developers. The classes are hints only; they are the VL developer's idea of how the control is commonly represented in the real world.#define VL_CLASS_NO_UI            0
#define VL_CLASS_SLIDER           1

#define VL_CLASS_LIST             6In the list above, VL_CLASS_NO_UI is often used for controls that have no user-interface metaphor and are not displayed in the video control panel or saved in the defaults file. The VL controls can be read-only, write-only, or both. The VL includes these macros:#define VL_CLASS_RDONLY      0x8000    /* control is read-only */
#define VL_CLASS_WRONLY      0x4000    /* control is write-only */

For example:vlSelectEvents(svr, path, VLTransferCompleteMask); Event masks can be or'ed together. For example:vlSelectEvents(svr, path, VLTransferCompleteMask |               VLTransferFailedMask);Depending on whether you want to block processing or not, use vlNextEvent() ID="Media3-4EH1"(blocking) or vlCheckEvent() (nonblocking) to get the next event.Use vlPeekEvent() to see what the next event in the queue is without removing it from the queue. For example, the part of the code that actually gets the event from the event loop uses vlNextEvent(), whereas another part of the code that just wants to know about it, for example, for priority purposes, uses vlPeekEvent().LBL="" HELPID=""ID="30316"Creating a VL Event LoopYou can set an event loop to run until a specific condition is fulfilled. The routine vlSelectEvents() allows you to specify which event the application will receive.Using an event loop requires creating an event mask to specify the events you want. The VL event mask symbols are combined with the bitwise OR operator. For example, to set an event mask to express interest in either transfer complete or control changed events, use:VLTransferCompleteMask | VLControlChangedMaskTo create an event loop, follow these steps:Define the event; for example:VLEvent ev;
name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188Set the event mask; for example:vlSelectEvents(vlServer, path, VLTransferCompleteMask | VLControlChangedMask)Block on the transfer process until at least one event is waiting:for(;;){
vlNextEvent(vlServer, &ev);Create the loop and define the choices; for example:switch(ev.reason){
        case VLTransferComplete:
        name='hellip' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=188
        break;
    case VLControlChanged:

    }
}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="39194"Creating a Main Loop with CallbacksvlMainLoop() is provided as a convenience routine for the application programmer and constitutes the main loop of VL applications. This routine first reads the next incoming video event; it then dispatches the event to the appropriate registered procedure. Note that the application does not return from this call.Applications are expected to exit in response to some user action. There is nothing special about vlMainLoop(); it is simply an infinite loop that calls the next event and then dispatches it. An application can provide its own version of this loop, for example, to test a global termination flag or to test that the number of top-level widgets is larger than zero before circling back to the call to the next event.To specify callbacks, that is, routines which are called when a particular VL event arrives, use vlAddCallback(). Its function prototype is:int vlAddCallback(VLServer vlServer, VLEvent * event,                  void * clientdata, VLEventMask events,                  VLCallbackProc callback, void *clientData)IDREF="11293" TYPE="TEXT"Example 14-1 illustrates the use of vlAddCallback().LBL="14-1"Example 14-1 ID="11293"Using VL Callbacksmain()

           dataPtr = vlGetActiveRegion(vlSvr, transferBuf, info);
       /* Done with that frame, free the memory used by it */
             vlPutFree(vlSvr, transferBuf);

}Delete a callback with vlRemoveCallback() or vlRemoveAllCallbacks(). Their function prototypes are:int vlRemoveCallback(VLServer vlServer, VLPath * path,       VLEventMask events, VLCallbackProc callback, void *clientData)
int vlRemoveAllCallbacks(VLServer vlServer, VLPath * path, VLEventMask events)The functions vlAddHandler() and vlRemoveHandler() are analogous to vlAddCallback() and vlRemoveCallback(), respectively. Use them for non-VL events.IDREF="89741" TYPE="TEXT"Example 14-2 illustrates how to create a main loop and event loops. CautionTo simplify the code, this example does not check returns.

For example, if chroma keying is set to blue, image A might show through image B everywhere the color blue appears in image B. A common example is the TV weather reporter standing in front of the satellite weather map. The weather reporter, wearing any color but blue, stands in front of a blue background; keying on blue shows the satellite picture everywhere blue appears. Because there is no blue on the weatherperson, he or she appears to be standing in front of the weather map.Luma keying: overlaying one image on another by choosing a level of luminance. For example, to overlay bright text (such as a caption) on video, a graphics source is created with the text on a dark background. The video source is made to show through the dark areas of the graphics; the bright text remains on top of the video.Transitions: fades, tiles, and wipes, such as single, double, or corner wipes, for which you can set the angle or center. This chapter explains how the VL performs blending. Topics in this chapter include:IDREF="14898" TYPE="TEXT"The VL Key GeneratorIDREF="95188" TYPE="TEXT"The VL Blend NodeIDREF="28169" TYPE="TEXT"VL Blending ControlsIDREF="14600" TYPE="TEXT"VL KeyingThe chapter concludes with example application programs.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="14898"The VL Key GeneratorBlending in the VL is based on values that the key generator assigns to each pixel in the sources to be blended. The key generator generates a key for each pixel in the two source nodes (foreground and background):If luma keying is set, the key generator assesses the brightness of each pixel. If chroma keying is set, the key generator assesses the color of each pixel. If spatial, or transition, keying (fade, tile, wipe) is set, the key generator assesses the (x,y) coordinates for each pixel.In addition, the key generator determines the alpha value (opacity) of a pixel and sets a value for it ranging from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). This alpha value can be used downstream for further layering operations.Key generation is usually for one alpha source only. The other alpha source can be constant or can come from a matte signal or from graphics on systems that support alpha rendering.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="95188"The VL Blend NodeBlending takes place in the VL's internal blend node, which is created with the vlGetNode() function.

On the back of the board is an I/O panel with a number of video connectors, which you can use to attach video devices to the IndigoVideo board. The IndigoVideo board translates video signals into a form usable by the IRIS Indigo workstation. It also does the reverse, translating graphics from the IRIS Indigo display into video signals.LBL="" HELPID=""Broadcast StandardsThe IndigoVideo hardware supports the two most popular broadcast standards, the National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) composite video standard and the Phase Alternated by Line (PAL) standard.LBL="" HELPID=""Video and Videotape FormatsYou can record video signals in a variety of videotape formats: S-VHS and Hi-8mm are two examples of common videotape formats. Although IndigoVideo doesn't distinguish between individual tape formats, you need to know what kind of connector your video equipment uses. The IndigoVideo board has two kinds of input connectors: composite and S-Video.Most home VCRs use composite connectors. S-Video, on the other hand, carries the color and brightness components of the picture on separate wires; hence, S-Video connectors are also called Y/C connectors. Most S-VHS and Hi-8mm VCRs feature S-Video connectors.In addition to composite and S-Video output, the IndigoVideo board provides analog RGB output, in which the image data is carried as three separate components: red, green, and blue intensity. The RGB output can be used in conjunction with an external encoder to produce formats that IndigoVideo does not support, or it can be used to drive an external video monitor.See IDREF="14650" TYPE="TITLE""Videotape Formats" in Chapter 11 for more information about videotape formats, which are summarized in IDREF="26172" TYPE="TABLE"Table 11-1 in that chapter.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="98955"IndigoVideo Data FormatsThis section describes the image data formats used by IndigoVideo. IndigoVideo uses three formats for image data: 32-bit RGB, 8-bit RGB, and 4:1:1 YUV. You should note that data coming from or going to the IndigoVideo board is always ordered top-to-bottom. The IRIS Indigo, on the other hand, commonly stores image data with lines ordered bottom-to-top. Both IRIS Indigo and IndigoVideo store pixels from left to right within lines.ID="Media4-1GS1"In the diagrams that follow, the bits are numbered from right to left, with the least significant (rightmost) bit numbered zero.LBL="" HELPID=""32-bit RGBID="Media4-1GS2"IndigoVideo uses 32-bit RGB format for single frame output, and it is produced by some of the video capture convenience routines. This format could also be called 24-bit RGB data, since each 32-bit pixel consists of 24 bits of RGB data and 8 bits of unused space.The format of these pixels is shown in IDREF="16609" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 17-1.FILE="RGB32.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="17-1"Figure 17-1 ID="16609"Format of 32-bit RGB Pixels32-bit RGB is produced by the functions svCaptureOneFrame(), svYUVtoRGB(), and svRGB8toRGB32(). The IRIS GL lrectwrite() function also uses this format, but it expects rows of pixels to be ordered bottom-to-top unless the default ordering has been changed using the IRIS GL pixmode() function. As noted above, data sent to the IndigoVideo board using the svPut24Frame() function should be ordered top-to-bottom. The svYUVtoRGB() and svRGB8toRGB32() functions will return data ordered top-to-bottom unless the invert parameter is TRUE.LBL="" HELPID=""8-bit RGBThe 8-bit RGB format stores 2 bits of blue and 3 bits each of red and green in an 8-bit pixel. The format of the 8-bit RGB pixels is shown in ID="Media4-1GS3"IDREF="32988" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 17-2.FILE="RGB8.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="17-2"Figure 17-2 ID="32988"Format of 8-bit RGB PixelsWhen you capture 8-bit RGB frames using IndigoVideo, you receive them with the fields uninterleaved, that is, the data contains all of the even lines (from top to bottom) followed by all of the odd lines.LBL="" HELPID=""4:1:1 YUVThe 4:1:1 YUV format is much closer in form to the original video signal than the RGB formats described above. The YUV format is also much more complicated. Each pixel is described by three components: one luminance value (Y) and a pair of chrominance values (U and V); however, there are four luminance samples to each pair of chrominance samples has (hence 4:1:1 YUV). This means that sets of 4 pixels share the same chrominance values but have individual luminance values. ID="Media4-1GS4"To further complicate matters, data from odd and even lines are interleaved within individual 32-bit words. The format of these words is shown in IDREF="51791" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 17-3.FILE="YUV.ai" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="17-3"Figure 17-3 ID="51791"Format of YUV Data WordsEach 32-bit word consists of 8 bits of unused space, followed by one Y sample (8 bits) and 2 bits each of U and V from the odd line, then a Y sample and 2 bits each of U and V from the even line. By collecting the chrominance data from 4 consecutive 32-bit words, you get a pair of chrominance samples for the odd line, and a pair of chrominance samples for the even line. The upper 2 bits of U and V come in the first word, the next highest set of bits comes in the next word, and so on. By putting these chrominance samples together with the 4 odd and 4 even luminance samples, you can reconstruct 8 YUV pixels. You can derive 8-bit red, green, and blue values from the YUV values using the following formulas:R = 1.164 name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180

In RGB colorspace, a color is defined by its red, green, and blue levels. In YUV colorspace, a color is defined by its luminance and by two chrominance components that determine its color. 4:1:1 means that the chrominance components are subsampled; that is, for each four Y samples, there is only one U sample and one V sample.The YUV pixels are converted to 24-bit RGB pixels.The 24-bit pixels are dithered down to 8-bit pixels.Before they can be displayed on the Indigo workstation, the video pixels must be reduced to 8-bit RGB pixels. IndigoVideo accomplishes this by dithering the video image. Dithering uses a small number of colors to simulate a larger number of colors using patterns of different colored pixels; for example, a pattern of red and yellow pixels can be used to represent orange.The video image is scaled down, if necessary.LBL="" HELPID=""Video OutputIn live video output mode, IndigoVideo receives 8-bit RGB pixels from the Indigo graphics subsystem. These 8-bit pixels are converted to 24-bit RGB pixels using a set of look-up tables. These 24-bit pixels drive a set of digital-to-analog converters, which produce the analog RGB output, and also a digital encoder, which produces composite and S-Video output. The digital encoder also generates a composite sync signal, which can be used to synchronize video devices with the IndigoVideo board. The timing for this signal can be generated by the IndigoVideo board itself, or it can be derived from either the input source or from a separate composite sync signal connected to input #3.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="23831"A Simple Program for Getting Started with IndigoVideoThis section presents a sample program to help you get started with writing a simple video application.

			descr='[mdash]'it assumes that a composite NTSC video source is connected to input #1name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'however, it demonstrates the basic principles of programming with the IndigoVideo Library. Here's a step-by-step description of what the program does:The program opens a window in which to display the video. First it specifies the preferred size for the window using prefsize(), then it calls winopen() to create the window. The winopen() routine returns a window identifier, which is used in step 4 to associate the video input with the window. The symbolic constants SV_NTSC_XMAX and SV_NTSC_YMAX represent the dimensions of an NTSC video frame. The program opens the video device. The svOpenVideo() routine returns a video handle that is passed to other routines in the IndigoVideo Library. This step also demonstrates the use of the IndigoVideo error reporting routine, svPerror(). The program sets up the IndigoVideo board to receive video input from source #1. This is the default input, so you could omit this step; however, this step is included to demonstrate the use of the svSetParam() routine. The svSetParam() routine can be used to select input source, broadcast standard, and more. Note that it is not necessary to set these parameters before associating video input with a window; video parameters can be changed at any time. Also note that once set up, live video display requires no CPU intervention.One of the arguments to svSetParam() is an array of long integers. Even-numbered elements of this array represent parameters to be changed, and the corresponding odd-numbered elements represent parameter values. In this program, the parameter being set is represented by the symbolic constant SV_SOURCE, and the value is represented by the symbolic constant SV_SOURCE1.After the setup is complete, the program attaches the video input to the window, using the svBindGLWindow() routine. This routine takes three arguments: a video handle, a window identifier, and a third argument indicating how to display the video input. The sample program uses the symbolic constant SV_IN_REPLACE for the third argument, indicating that video should replace the contents of the window. The other possible values for the third argument are SV_IN_UNDER, for video underlay, SV_IN_OVER, for video overlay, and SV_IN_OFF, to deactivate video display in the window.Finally, the program enters an IRIS GL event handling loop, displaying video input until the user elects to quit by pressing the <Esc> key. Once set up, live video display requires no CPU intervention. When the user exits, the program closes the video device by using the svCloseVideo() routine. This routine deallocates the data structures associated with the video handle.More sophisticated event handling methods are presented later in this guidename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'new development should use X event handling rather than IRIS GL event handling.

This section describes some of the parameters that affect the video input window. See svGetParam(3V) for a complete list of parameters.svSetParam() takes three arguments: a video handle, an array of long integers specifying parameters and values, and an argument specifying the length of the array. The values in the array are interpreted in pairs: the first member of each pair represents the parameter to be changed; the second member represents the new value for that parameter.

}
svSetParam(V, param, 2);
}LBL="" HELPID=""Selecting the Input Signal TypeTo enable the IndigoVideo board to display video input correctly, you must set it to the correct broadcast standard and format. These may be set using svSetParam(). The broadcast standard parameter, SV_BROADCAST, may be set to one of two values: SV_NTSC for NTSC video, or SV_PAL for PAL video. The SV_VIDEO_MODE parameter controls input format; it can be set to SV_COMP for composite video input, or SV_SVIDEO for S-Video input.You can also set the default video mode and broadcast standard for each input source using the Video Control Panel. This procedure is explained in IDREF="59277" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 22, "Using the IndigoVideo Utilities."LBL="" HELPID=""Freezing and Restarting Video InputFreeze the video input by setting the SV_FREEZE parameter to TRUE. Doing so holds the current frame in the IndigoVideo frame buffer. Setting SV_FREEZE to FALSE restarts live input.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="58105"Querying Video ParametersYou can determine the value of a parameter by using the svGetParam() routine. This routine takes exactly the same arguments as svSetParam(), but instead of reading new parameter values from the array, it fills in the current parameter values in the appropriate places.The code fragment in IDREF="92868" TYPE="TEXT"Example 18-3 displays the number of the currently selected input source.LBL="18-3"Example 18-3 ID="92868"Getting the Input Source NumberSVhandle V;

                 break;
}
printf("Current video source is %d\n", source);In addition to the input parameters already mentioned, two special read-only parameters can be used in conjunction with svGetParam() to get information about the video source (if any) connected to the current input: SV_SIGNAL_STDcan be used to query the broadcast standard used by the current source. The parameter value returned is one of:SV_NTSC for NTSC input SV_PAL for PAL input SV_NOSIGNAL if there is no signal on the current input source SV_SIGNAL_COLORcan be used to query whether the current input signal contains color information. The returned value is either TRUE or FALSE.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="66827"Positioning and Scaling the Video InputBy default, the IndigoVideo software displays video input at full resolution, with the origin of the video image at the upper left corner of the video input window. You can set the size and position of the video image using the svSetSize() and svWindowOffset() routines. If you call one of these routines after binding video to a window, you must rebind the video using either svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow() for the change to take effect.NoteThe IndigoVideo positioning and scaling routines take arguments in pixels, not in IRIS GL coordinates. Because arguments to svSetSize() and svWindowOffset() are not in IRIS GL coordinates, they are not affected by the current IRIS GL transformation matrix. LBL="" HELPID=""Setting the Size of the Video ImageYou can set the size of the video image within certain constraints:The aspect ratio of the image (ratio of horizontal size to vertical size) must remain constant.The image can be scaled only in increments of 8 pixels of horizontal size and 6 pixels of vertical size.The image cannot be larger than the video frame size (640 by 480 pixels for NTSC, 768 by 576 pixels for PAL).To allow the user to resize the video input window, you can use the IRIS GL minsize(), maxsize(), and stepunit() routines to constrain the window to a useful size.IDREF="65351" TYPE="TEXT"Example 18-4 contains a listing of APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/video/indigovideo/sizeinput.c" PARMS=""sizeinput.c

}In the preceding example, the window is constrained to sizes supported by the IndigoVideo software. The event loop handles the resizing of the video input. When the program receives a REDRAW event, which could indicate a size change, it determines the new size of the window, calls svSetSize() to scale the video input appropriately, and rebinds the video input to the window.If you use svSetSize() to specify a size that IndigoVideo cannot produce, it will select the closest possible size. To determine what size will result from a given pair of arguments, use the svQuerySize() routine. The code fragment in IDREF="63176" TYPE="TEXT"Example 18-5 finds the closest match to the desired size and resizes the window accordingly.LBL="18-5"Example 18-5 ID="63176"Approximating the Requested Video Window Size SVhandle V;

svBindGLWindow(V, win, SV_IN_REPLACE);LBL="" HELPID=""Positioning the Video ImageBy default, the origin of the live video image is at the upper left corner of the live video input window. You can change this position using the svWindowOffset() routine. To do this, specify vertical and horizontal offsets, in pixels, from the upper left corner of the input window to the upper left corner of the video image. These values may be negative, meaning that you can use a small window to "pan" across the video image. The code fragment in IDREF="42939" TYPE="TEXT"Example 18-6 demonstrates the use of svWindowOffset():LBL="18-6"Example 18-6 ID="42939"Specifying a Video Window Offset SVhandle V;
int xoffset, yoffset, win;
/* ... */
svWindowOffset(V, xoffset, yoffset);
svBindGLWindow(V, win, SV_IN_REPLACE);NoteThe live video image cannot be positioned such that any part of the image is off the edge of the screen. Thus, if you have a window in the upper left corner of the screen, negative window offsets will be ignored. The entire video image must remain within the screen dimensions, even if you are viewing only a small portion of the image. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="49701"Preventing Other Programs from Using VideoTo prevent other programs from changing video parameters while your program is running, you can request exclusive use of the IndigoVideo board by calling the svUseExclusive() routine with a value of TRUE for the onoff parameter, as demonstrated in IDREF="77007" TYPE="TEXT"Example 18-7.LBL="18-7"Example 18-7 ID="77007"Getting Exclusive Use of the IndigoVideo Board SVhandle V;

if (status == -1) {
svPerror("Couldn't get exclusive use");
/* error handling*/
}While one process has exclusive use of the IndigoVideo board, any other process that makes a call to the IndigoVideo Library will receive an error.To get out of exclusive use mode, call svUseExclusive() FALSE.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="32750"Combining Video and GraphicsYou can combine video and graphics in a window using either of two modes: video underlay or video overlay. In video replace mode, which has been used in this guide until now, all of the pixels in the video image are displayed. In video underlay and overlay modes, video pixels replace only selected graphics pixels. In video underlay mode, the decision whether to display a video pixel or a graphics pixel at a given location is based on the value of the graphics pixel. In video overlay mode, this decision is based on the value of the video pixelname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'meaning that in video underlay mode you specify which parts of your graphic image should be replaced by video; in video overlay mode you specify which parts of the video image should be replaced by graphics.Video underlay mode is typically used for such applications as video titling, where you want to display text or graphics superimposed over video. See IDREF="49749" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 15-6 on IDREF="49749" TYPE="TEXT"page 368 in IDREF="57047" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 15, "VL Blending," for an illustration of this technique, but use the method described in this section for producing this effect with the IndigoVideo board.You might use video overlay mode for a "TV weatherman" effect, superimposing a live video image over a computer-generated backdrop. See IDREF="27748" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 15-8 on IDREF="27748" TYPE="TEXT"page 370 in IDREF="57047" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 15, "VL Blending,"for an illustration of this technique, but use the method described in this section for producing this effect with the IndigoVideo board.LBL="" HELPID=""Video Underlay ModeIn video underlay mode, video pixels replace graphics pixels that have a value of zero. In IRIS GL programs that use RGB mode, video pixels replace black graphics pixels. In X programs, and in IRIS GL programs that use color map mode, video replaces the color that is mapped to zero. There are advantages and disadvantages to both IRIS GL modes.LBL="" HELPID=""RGB Mode IRIS GL ProgramsRGB mode allows you to take better advantage of the IRIS GL's special 3D effects such as lighting and shading; however, all black pixels are replaced by video, so you can't display black objects over video. Furthermore, in RGB mode, the Indigo workstation simulates 24-bit color using a dithering algorithm, which produces several black pixels in any expanse of a dark color. This means that dark objects appear partially transparent, which is usually the opposite of the desired effect. This effect is particularly noticeable in double-buffered mode. Getting the effect you want in RGB mode can require some experimentation.A detailed description of IRIS GL lighting and shading routines is beyond the scope of this guide, but here are some hints for producing good-looking graphics in RGB mode:When drawing Gouraud shaded polygons, use fairly light colorsname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'they appear more opaque than darker colors because light colors do not dither to black.When drawing lighted objects, use more than one light. With one light, objects are defined by the contrast between light and shadow; however, in video underlay mode, the shadows will look transparent. If you use two lights of contrasting colors on opposite sides of an object, you can define the object using the contrast between the two colors. For example, light a sphere from above using a white light, and fill the shadow by lighting it from below using a blue light. In some cases, using more than one light can affect the graphics performance.The Graphics Library Programming Guide covers Gouraud shading and IRIS GL lighting in the chapters "Display and Color Modes," and "Lighting."LBL="" HELPID=""Color Map Mode IRIS GL ProgramsColor map mode provides a certain flexibility in that it allows you to use any color you want without the side effects dithering can produce; however, it is much more difficult to produce lighted or Gouraud shaded polygons in color map mode. For applications that do not require these effects, you're better off using color map mode. The Graphics Library Programming Guide chapters listed in the previous section also describe lighting and Gouraud shading in color map mode.IDREF="16406" TYPE="TEXT"Example 18-8 demonstrates the use of video underlay mode with IRIS GL color map mode.

}LBL="" HELPID=""Video Overlay Mode and Chroma KeyingIn video overlay mode, video pixel values can be "keyed" out. Video pixels replace graphics pixels, except where the value of a video pixel matches one of the keyed values. This allows you to select certain colors in the video image to be replaced by graphics.The IndigoVideo board has a 256-entry array of chroma keys, called the chroma key map. This array is indexed by pixel value (the 8-bit RGB pixels are treated as 8-bit unsigned integers), so entry zero in the chroma key map corresponds to pixels of value zero (black pixels). If the value of this entry is 1, black video pixels will be keyed out. If the value is zero, black video pixels will be displayed.You can load a new chroma key map by using the svLoadMap() routine. The chroma key map is passed to svLoadMap() as a 256-entry array of rgb_tuple structures, which are red, green, blue triplets. The red portion of the array is used for the chroma key map, and the rest of the array is ignored.

 *  This program demonstrates how to manipulate the IndigoVideo

 *  Clicking the left mouse button over a color toggles the value for that
 *  entry. An X mark in a box means that color will be keyed out (i.e.,

 *  be used to clear or set all of the entries. The program initializes
 *  all entries to 0 when it starts up.
 *
 *  To demonstrate keying, compile and run the voverlay program in
 *  this directory. As you set entries in the key map, the graphics
 *  in voverlay will begin to appear. If you set all of the entries,

}LBL="20"ID="46637"Capturing Video from IndigoVideoThis chapter explains how to capture video using the IndigoVideo board. The IndigoVideo Library provides these three methods for capturing video:single frameburst modecontinuous modeIn this chapter:IDREF="85649" TYPE="TITLE""Captured Video Data Formats" provides a brief introduction to the data formats for capturing video.IDREF="86973" TYPE="TITLE""Capturing a Single Video Frame" describes the single-frame capture method. You can easily capture a single frame of video with just one call to the convenience routine svCaptureOneFrame(). IDREF="34690" TYPE="TITLE""Capturing Video Frames in Burst Mode" describes the burst-mode capture method. In burst mode, IndigoVideo captures a buffer full of sequential frames at full frame rate in most formats. You can use burst mode capture in conjunction with a computer-controllable video device to read in segments of video and stop the deck while your program processes the buffer full of frames.IDREF="82689" TYPE="TITLE""Capturing Video Frames in Continuous Mode" describes the continuous-mode capture method. In continuous mode, IndigoVideo captures frames of video into a queue at less than full frame rate. In this mode, you can capture reduced size and reduced frame rate video directly to disk, allowing you to collect images for a movie without a computer-controllable video device. In continuous capture mode, you can capture frames at no more than half the normal frame rate.IDREF="10851" TYPE="TITLE""Using Data Conversion Routines" describes how to convert video data for graphics display.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="85649"Captured Video Data FormatsThis section describes the data formats used by the IndigoVideo Library capture routines. For more information on these formats, see IDREF="98955" TYPE="TITLE""IndigoVideo Data Formats" in Chapter 17. The data formats are listed below, along with the symbolic constants that the IndigoVideo Library uses to identify them.SV_RGB8_FRAMESThis is the default format. In this mode, IndigoVideo captures 8-bit RGB frames. The fields that make up these frames are not interleaved; that is, all of the odd lines in the image come first, followed by all the even lines. 8-bit RGB frames are dithered unless the SV_DITHER parameter is set to FALSE.SV_YUV411_FRAMES_AND_BLANKING_BUFFERIn this mode, the IndigoVideo board captures full-size YUV frames, complete with the data carried in the blanking interval of the video signal. YUV format provides the best resolution and the most accurate color representation of the available options. The blanking portion of the video signal is sometimes used to carry extra information, such as the closed captioning provided on some television broadcasts. The blanking buffer takes the form of an extra 22 lines of data preceding the picture data; therefore, frames in this format are 640 by 502 pixels (NTSC) or 768 by 598 pixels (PAL). Use the svFindVisibleRegion() routine to find the first line of the image data following the blanking buffer.SV_RGB32_FRAMESThis format is not produced directly by IndigoVideo, but is produced by the convenience routines svCaptureOneFrame() and svYUVtoRGB(). In these frames, each pixel is represented by a 32-bit word containing 24 bits of RGB data.SV_YUV411_FRAMESThis format consists of interleaved 4:1:1 YUV frames without the blanking data mentioned above.

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="34690"Capturing Video Frames in Burst ModeUse the svCaptureBurst() routine to capture a contiguous series of frames into a previously allocated buffer. In burst mode, you can capture full-sized YUV frames with blanking buffers or 8-bit RGB frames at full or reduced size. Initiating a burst capture puts the IndigoVideo board into exclusive mode, which remains set until the capture is complete or an error occurs. You must pass svCaptureBurst() a pointer to an svCaptureInfo structure, which determines the number and type of frames to be captured. This svCaptureInfo structure can also be passed to svQueryCaptureBufferSize() to determine how much memory to allocate for the capture buffer. The fields in the svCaptureInfo structure are listed in IDREF="71331" TYPE="TABLE"Table 20-2. Remember that the width and height members of the svCaptureInfo structure are input-output parameters; if you set them to an unsupported size, they will be set to the nearest approximation of the requested size when you call svQueryCaptureBufferSize() or svCaptureBurst().The final argument to svCaptureBurst() is an optional pointer to a bitvector for the SV_RGB8_FRAMES format, which can be used to determine whether any fields have been dropped during the capture. Fields must occasionally be dropped during capture to avoid visible tearing in the image due to scan rate conversion. The SV_FIELDDROP parameter controls whether fields are dropped, see svGetParam(3) for details.Every captured frame is represented by a pair of status bits (one for each field) in the bitvector. Each bit is set to either SV_EVEN_FIELD or SV_ODD_FIELD. Every frame should consist of an even field followed by an odd field; if this is not true, then one or more fields have been dropped during the capture. Use the SV_GET_FIELD macro, which is defined in svideo.h, to determine the even or odd value for a specific field. The code fragment in IDREF="81352" TYPE="TEXT"Example 20-3 prints the even/odd values for the fields that make up the frames from a captured burst.LBL="20-3"Example 20-3 ID="81352"Using the SV_GET_FIELD Macro for (f = 0; f < info->size; f++) {

SV_GET_FIELD(framevec, 2*f+1) == SV_EVEN_FIELD ? "even" : "odd");
}
putchar('\n');The status bits are filled in starting with the least significant bit in the first byte of the bitvector. You must allocate one byte of bitvector for every four frames or fraction thereof. Use the SV_BITVEC_SIZE macro to calculate the size of the buffer in bytes for a given number of frames.The format can be either 8-bit RGB or YUV with blanking buffer. This is because data is transferred directly from IndigoVideo to memory, and the IndigoVideo hardware produces only these two formats. If you need 32-bit RGB frames, you can capture YUV frames and use svFindVisibleRegion() and svYUVtoRGB() to convert the data, as discussed in IDREF="54738" TYPE="TITLE""Converting YUV Data to RGB". See the APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/video/indigovideo/burstcapt.c" PARMS=""burstcapt.c
 sample program in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/video/indigovideo for a demonstration of how to capture and display a burst of frames in either format.The number of frames that can be captured in burst mode is limited to what will fit in the memory buffer, which has a maximum size of 8 MB. The frame size affects how many frames will fit in the buffer, because larger frames have more data.NoteCurrently, svCaptureBurst() can only capture YUV frames with blanking data at half the full frame rate.The code fragment in IDREF="64535" TYPE="TEXT"Example 20-4 shows how to use svCaptureBurst().LBL="20-4"Example 20-4 ID="64535"Capturing Frames in Burst Mode SVhandle V;

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="82689"Capturing Video Frames in Continuous ModeIn continuous capture mode, IndigoVideo writes frames of video into a queue while your program reads frames out of the queue. To enter continuous capture mode, call svInitContinousCapture(), which allocates memory for the capture queue and begins capturing frames. You can read frames from the queue using the svGetCaptureData() routine. Once you are done with a frame, you must release it using svUnlockCaptureData(). When you are done capturing frames, call svEndContinuousCapture() to leave continuous capture mode.Continuous capture mode does not give you full frame ratename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'the maximum frame rate achievable in this mode is one half the normal frame rate.

success = svInitContinuousCapture(V, capInfo);svInitContinousCapture() allocates the frame capture queue and takes control of the IndigoVideo board using the svUseExclusive() routine. If another program already has exclusive use of the board, svInitContinousCapture() returns -1; if it succeeds, svInitContinuousCapture() returns 0. In this example, 8-bit RGB frames are being captured at half size and half frame rate.Call svEndContinuousCapture() after you have completed video capture, to release control of the board. If you release control of the video board using svUseExclusive() during continuous capture mode, continuous capture mode is automatically terminated.LBL="" HELPID=""Accessing Captured DataTo access the next frame in the video capture queue, use the svGetCaptureData() routine. When you're done with the frame, release it using svUnlockCaptureData(), so that IndigoVideo can reuse the memory.The code fragment in IDREF="13567" TYPE="TEXT"Example 20-6 demonstrates how to access and release captured frames.LBL="20-6"Example 20-6 ID="13567"Accessing and Releasing Captured Frames SVhandle V;

}The data parameter is pointed to the next frame in the queue, and the fieldID parameter is filled in to indicate the ID of the first field in the frame. If there are no frames in the queue, the data parameter is set to NULL (this will happen if you are processing frames faster than they are captured).Because there are two fields in each frame, the fieldID value increases by 2 for each video frame. Therefore, for a sampling rate of S, the fieldID should increase by 2 name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180
	TeX='\times ' descr='[times]'S between captured frames. If the fieldID increases by more than 2 name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180
	TeX='\times ' descr='[times]'S between captured frames, you have missed one or more frames. This could be because the system load is high, or because the queue has filled up, forcing the IndigoVideo board to drop frames.Although you don't have to unlock a frame before you get the next one, it's a good idea; if you keep a lot of frames locked, you will probably force the IndigoVideo software to drop frames. At any rate, you should unlock frames in the same order in which you received them. The IndigoVideo software writes the frames in order, and if it encounters a locked frame, it will block until the frame is unlocked.The data parameter points to memory in the queue, which may be overwritten as soon as you release the element. Once you have the queue element, you'll probably want to write it to disk or copy it to a location where it won't be overwritten.LBL="" HELPID=""Leaving Continuous Capture ModeTo leave continuous capture mode, call svEndContinuousCapture(), as demonstrated below:SVhandle V;

For more information on the various data formats that IndigoVideo uses, see IDREF="98955" TYPE="TITLE""IndigoVideo Data Formats" in Chapter 17.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="54738"Converting YUV Data to RGBThe IndigoVideo Library provides a utility routine, svYUVtoRGB(), for converting YUV frames to RGB format. This routine produces 32-bit pixels, as used by the IRIS GL lrectwrite() routine. Each pixel contains 24 bits of RGB data and 8 bits of unused space. (In the YUV format, a pixel takes up only 16 bits, so if you're trying to record frames to disk as fast as possible, you should store the YUV data directly and convert it later.)Rows of pixels in the YUV frames are ordered top-to-bottom. This differs from the default ordering used by the IRIS GL lrectwrite() routine, which is bottom-to-top. If you set the invert parameter to TRUE, the svYUVtoRGB() routine will return an RGB frame with lines ordered bottom-to-top. If invert is FALSE, svYUVtoRGB() will not perform this inversion (this is useful because the X Window System expects the top-to-bottom ordering).Alternately, if you want to display the frame, you can set up lrectwrite() to use top-to-bottom ordering by using the IRIS GL pixmode() routine, as shown in IDREF="66476" TYPE="TEXT"Example 20-7.LBL="20-7"Example 20-7 ID="66476"Setting Top-to-Bottom pixmode for YUV boolean invert = FALSE;

}LBL="21"ID="61431"Handling IndigoVideo EventsPrograms that use live video need to be notified when the setup or status of the IndigoVideo board changes. This chapter explains how to use either the X Window System or IRIS GL event mechanisms to provide your application with notification of status changes to the IndigoVideo board.The X and IRIS GL event mechanisms are different, but they serve the same purpose. X event handling methods distinguish between video activity events and parameter change events; IRIS GL event handling methods lump these event classes together as a single pseudodevice. Wherever possible, X event handling should be used rather than IRIS GL event handling to provide greater portability and flexibility. See the IRIS IM Programming Guide, which you can read online using the IRIS InSight viewer, for more details about X event handling versus IRIS GL event handling.In this chapter:IDREF="87998" TYPE="TITLE""IndigoVideo Event Handling Basics" provides an overview of video events and the event-handling routines in the IndigoVideo library.IDREF="58947" TYPE="TITLE""X Event Handling" describes some event handling methods provided by the X Window System. To learn more about these methods, and to find out about other methods, consult the references recommended at the beginning of this guide.IDREF="99344" TYPE="TITLE""IRIS GL Event Handling" describes pure IRIS GL event handling. Skip this section if you are developing a new IndigoVideo application, and use the methods described in IDREF="58947" TYPE="TITLE""X Event Handling" instead.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="87998"IndigoVideo Event Handling BasicsPrograms receive video activity events only if they use live video, that is, only if they have executed an svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow() call. The four reasons for which the window system generates a video activity event are: video startedThis event indicates that video has started in this window. It is generated when your program succeeds in turning on video using svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow().video stoppedThis event indicates that video has stopped in this window. It is generated when your program turns off video using svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow() with an argument of SV_IN_OFF.video busyYour program tried to turn on video in this window using svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow(), but failed because another program had exclusive use of the IndigoVideo board.video preemptedYour program had video running in this window, but it was preempted by another program calling svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow().These event reasons are identified by global variables, listed in IDREF="11409" TYPE="TABLE"Table 21-1.COLUMNS="2"LBL="21-1"Table 21-1 ID="11409"Video Activity Event Variable NamesLEFT="0" WIDTH="171"ReasonLEFT="180" WIDTH="171"Variable NameLEFT="0" WIDTH="171"Video startedLEFT="180" WIDTH="171"SvVideoStartedLEFT="0" WIDTH="171"Video stoppedLEFT="180" WIDTH="171"SvVideoStoppedLEFT="0" WIDTH="171"Video busyLEFT="180" WIDTH="171"SvVideoBusyLEFT="0" WIDTH="171"Video preemptedLEFT="180" WIDTH="171"SvVideoPreemptedThe five types of parameter change events are:active attribute changeThis event indicates that a process has given up live video input; for example, by exiting, or by calling svBindWindow() or svBindGLWindow() with an argument of SV_IN_OFF.signal changeThis event is generated whenever a process changes the broadcast standard and/or video mode by calling svSetParam().

These utility programs provide a convenient way of accessing many of the IndigoVideo board's functions. In addition, you may find them helpful as a reference when debugging your IndigoVideo Library programs.Two graphical user interface (GUI) tools are available for controlling video: Video Control Panel (vpanel) and Video Pro Panel (vpro). You can use the Video Control Panel by itself for viewing live video input, grabbing frames of video, and encoding graphics to video, or you can use vpanel in conjunction with your IndigoVideo Library programs. As long as your program does not use exclusive-use mode, you can use vpanel to switch input sources and control display effects, such as dithering and hue. The Video Pro Panel provides access to IndigoVideo's low-level parameters. All the parameters that can be set using the Video Pro Panel are listed on the svSetParams(3V) manual page.Live video windows for input (videoin) and output (videoout) can be launched separately from a command line or from vpanel. See the videoin(1) and videout(1) man pages for details.See the Media Control Panels User's Guide, which is accessible from the InSight viewer, for complete instructions on using the Video Control Panel, Video Pro Panel, and the live video windows. Be sure to read the Svideo Release Notes for important information about software updates and notes about special situations and workarounds.This chapter explains how to use two other utilities: svcmd, an interactive shell-level tool that lets you access IndigoVideo Library routines from a shell command line or a shell script, and svtomovie, a program that lets you turn video input into movie files that you can play using the Movie Maker tool.In this chapter:IDREF="54737" TYPE="TITLE""Using svcmd, the IndigoVideo Shell-level Tool" explains how to use svcmd. The IndigoVideo shell-level tool provides a command-line interface to most of the functions of the IndigoVideo Library, including single-frame output (but not including DMA). You can use the shell-level tool to control IndigoVideo functions from a shell script.IDREF="56432" TYPE="TITLE""Making a Movie File from IndigoVideo and Audio Input" explains how to use svtomovie to create movies that can be viewed with Movie Player.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="54737"Using svcmd, the IndigoVideo Shell-level ToolYou can use the shell-level tool, svcmd, to control the IndigoVideo board from the command line. You can also use svcmd in shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks. You can use the shell-level tool in one of two ways: either by specifying a single operation on the command line, or by using svcmd's interactive mode.To get a listing of svcmd commands, enter:svcmd -hTo execute a single command, use the syntax:svcmd command [parameters]For example, to set the input source to 1, enter:svcmd inputsource 1To start svcmd in interactive mode, use the -i flag. To exit svcmd, use the quit or exit command. For example, to set the input source to 2 and the video mode to composite, type:svcmd -isvcmd >> inputsource 2svcmd >> videomode compsvcmd >> quitFor more information on svcmd, see the svcmd(1) manual page.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="56432"Making a Movie File from IndigoVideo and Audio InputYou can use IndigoVideo input and optional audio input to make a movie. Movies are files that can be played on the Indigo workstation from the Movie Player tool. The svtomovie program provides everything you need to make a movie using your IndigoVideo board, audio input if you wish, and a little imagination.To start svtomovie from a shell command line, enter:svtomovie [options] filenameto which the system replies:svtomovie: Press <ENTER> when you are ready to collect video:You must now "queue" the video source, that is, advance it to the location where the recording is to begin. You can use vpanel to set up the video source and apanel to set up the audio sourcename='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'svtomovie responds to control from both of these tools.When you press 
<Enter>, svtomovie collects video, and optionally audio, and writes it to the file you specified in filename.When svtomovie finishes capturing the video (and audio) frames, it rewrites the movie file to a playable format. You can play your new movie with Movie Player or edit it with Movie Maker.The svtomovie options are: -aTurn audio off; audio is on by default. This makes a silent movie and has the possible advantage of capturing more video data, because the audio capturing is disabled and is not using CPU bandwidth. -bUse burst mode for capture; continuous mode is the default. Burst mode is useful to get short bursts of 30 frames per second. It captures only 30 frames per second, and can capture directly to only a maximum 8MB memory buffer; hence, there is no audio, and, depending on the chosen size, a limited number of frames. -dTurn diagnostic messaging on; diagnostics are off by default. See svtomovie(1) for a list of diagnostics.-f framerateSpecifies movie frame rate; the default rate is 15 frames per second. This option is ignored if -b is used. In continuous capture mode, the only legal values for this parameter are 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, and 1. All other values will gather data at one of these rates but movie playback will be at the requested rate. In burst capture mode, the only legal value is 30. All other values will be ignored. -mTurn audio monitoring on; audio monitoring is off by default. This option is ignored if -a or -b is used. -n numframesSpecifies number of frames of movie; 100 is the default. -sUse stereo audio input; mono is the default. This option is ignored if -a or -b is used. -w widthSpecifies the video width in pixels; 320 is the default.

Other applications include:Information delivery and storage, including multimedia presentations, publications, interactive training, archiving, and annotation.

This is especially useful when the data rate is limited by the transmission medium. Cost savings can also be realized when transmitting data over a medium where you are billed on the basis of either access time or number of bytes transferred.Animation previewingImages can be compressed frame-by-frame, as they are rendered, for previewing 2D and 3D graphics animations in live action before recording to video tape. Previewing saves time for animators because they don't have to render and record a full-data animation to tape every time they want to check the motion sequence.ID="Media5-0ZIN7"Movie (audio and video) editingMovie editing can be done entirely in the digital domain using a tool such as MovieMaker, instead of editing a tape recording.

You can query the library for the available algorithms, and you can add your own algorithms to the library. A pass-through capability allows you to pass data through the routines without using an algorithm.ID="Media5-0ZIN11"The libcl API provides facilities for working with audio, still images, sequential frames of data (movies), and a buffering mechanism for random access of compressed data.The buffering facility allows independent buffering of compressed data and decompressed frames, with synchronous or asynchronous access, either external or internal to the library. Separate processes can be used for supplying data, compressing/decompressing, and retrieving data.The API also uses a set of global state parameters, similar to those found in the Audio Library, libaudio, to establish and manipulate compression attributes.LBL="" HELPID=""Compression Library BasicsThis section introduces compression technology and compression standards. It provides useful background information that you should know before using the Compression Library.LBL="" HELPID=""Lossy versus Lossless Compression MethodsCompressed data isn't always a perfect representation of the original data. Information can be lost in the compression process. A ID="Media5-0ZIN12"lossless compression method retains all of the information present in the original data. A ID="Media5-0ZIN13"lossy compression method does not preserve 100% of the information in the original method. Some methods incur more loss than others, so the amount of loss that can be tolerated by your application might affect your decision about which compression method to use.NoteIn general, video compression algorithms are designed to work on camera-generated images. Computer-generated images often contain text and line drawings that compression algorithms can't compress as well as smooth-shaded computer images, which approximate camera video.ID="Media5-0ZIN14"LBL="" HELPID=""Compression StandardsStandards provide a common ground for developers to share technology. Standards for the audio and video industries are constantly being developed and changed in response to new technology. The Compression Library supports these standards through the use of algorithms and parameters.ID="Media5-0ZIN15"LBL="" HELPID=""Compression Library AlgorithmsAlgorithms are provided within libcl for audio and video standards and for Silicon Graphics proprietary algorithms that have significant benefits. You can query the library for the available algorithms, and you can add your own algorithms to the library. Algorithms are grouped according to the type of data they operate on: still images, motion video, or audio.LBL="" HELPID=""Still Image AlgorithmsAlthough any algorithm can be used for still images, the JPEG ID="Media5-0ZIN16"(Joint Photographic Experts Group)-baseline algorithm, which is referred to simply as JPEG for the remainder of this guide, is the best for most applications.JPEG is a compression standard for compressing full-color or grayscale digital images. JPEG is most useful for still images; it is usable, but slow when performed in software, for video. You can use the Cosmo Compress option, a hardware JPEG accelerator, in conjunction with the Compression Library for compressing video to and decompressing video from memory or for compressing to and decompressing from a special video connection to Galileo Video, IndyVideo, or Indigo2 video.JPEG is a lossy algorithm, meaning that the compressed image is not a perfect representation of the original image, but you may not be able to detect the differences with the naked eye.The amount of compression and the quality of the resulting image are independent of the image data. The quality depends on the compression ratio. The Compression Library lets you select the compression ratio that best suits your application needs.JPEG is designed for still images and is usable, but slow, for video. JPEG is typically used to compress each still frame during the writing or editing process, with the intention being to apply another type of compression to the final version of the movie or to leave it uncompressed. JPEG works better on high-resolution, continuous-tone images such as photographs, than on crisp-edged, high-contrast images like line drawings.LBL="" HELPID=""Movie AlgorithmsFor the best quality in a final movie, all image manipulation and storage should be with uncompressed images until the final movie is produced, at which time the images can be compressed. Repeatedly compressing, decompressing, and then recompressing images reduces the image quality.The Compression Library supports the following algorithms for motion video compression/decompression: CL_MPEG_VIDEOID="Media5-0ZIN17"Moving Pictures Expert Group is a standard that is designed for extreme compression of motion video while maintaining high image quality. It is a lossy algorithm that is capable of producing higher compression ratios than both JPEG and MVC1.MPEG I is designed to give the best possible quality for a 1.2 million bits per second (Mbps) data rate for audio as well as video data. Other data rates are possible.The quality depends on the sophistication of the encoder. Quality (subjectively evaluated) between VHS and S-VHS can be achieved for images whose frame size is 352 name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180

			descr='[mdash]'compression requires considerably more processing power than decompression because MPEG examines the sequence of frames and compresses it in a optimized way, including compressing the difference between frames using motion estimation.The compressed data stream is designed so that the video can be played forward or backward. This makes MPEG well suited for video publishing, where a video is compressed once and decompressed many times for playback.CL_MVC1ID="Media5-0ZIN18"Motion Video Compressor 1 is a Silicon Graphics proprietary algorithm that is a good general-purpose compression scheme. It is a color-cell compression technique that works well for video, but can cause fuzzy edges in high-contrast animation. MVC1 is a fairly lossy algorithm that does not produce compression ratios as high as JPEG, but it is well suited to movies.ID="Media5-0ZIN19"CL_MVC2Motion Video Compressor 2 provides results similar to MVC1 in terms of image quality. MVC2 compresses the data more than MVC1, but takes longer to perform the compression. Playback is faster for MVC2, because there is less data to read in, and decompression is faster than for MVC1.CL_RLEID="Media5-0ZIN20"8-bit Run Length Encode is a lossless algorithm for compressing 8-bit RGB. It is the only algorithm currently available to directly compress 8-bit RGB data (CL_RGB332). Although this algorithm is lossless, it doesn't save as much space as the other compression algorithmsname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'typically less than 2:1 compression is achieved. The libcl implementation of RLE does not use a standard RLE method.  This is a lossless compression method that uses run-length encoding (RLE). Run-length encoding compresses images by storing a color and its run-length (the number of pixels of that color) every time the color changes. It is a good technique for animations where there are large areas that have identical colorsRun-length encoding replaces pixel values that are repeated for several pixels in a row with a single pixel at the first occurrence of a particular value, followed by a repeat count representing the number of subsequent pixels of the same value. CL_RLE2424-bit Run Length Encode is a lossless algorithm for compressing 24-bit RGB.CL_RTR1ID="Media5-0ZIN21"Real Time Record is a Silicon Graphics proprietary algorithm designed for recording directly from a camera or VTR to disk or digital audio tape (DAT) by compressing on the fly. The quality achieved is dependent upon the processor performance and video hardware that is available.LBL="" HELPID=""Audio AlgorithmsThe Compression Library supports two audio algorithms that are based on international standards:CCITT/TSB G.711 name='mgr' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=109

In Europe, A-law is more prevalent.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="58292"Compression Library Data FormatsThis section provides a brief introduction to digital media formats. It describes the fundamental nature of digital data and introduces some basic terminology that you should know before using the Compression Library.Many different formats exist for audio, image, and video data. The Compression Library supports the most common formats, but it doesn't restrict you to using one of these formats. In fact, you can define your own unique format to suit your application needs. For example, you can define a file format that contains interleaved frames of audio and video for a movie application, or you can define a file format that contains multiple tracks of audio data for an audio-mixing application.The following sections describe some of the data formats you are likely to encounter when developing applications that use the Compression Library.ID="Media5-0ZIN24"LBL="" HELPID=""Audio Data FormatsAudio data occurs in a stream, which can be divided into units called blocks. Audio data can be monaural (mono), which has one channel embedded in the audio stream, or stereo, which has two channels embedded in the audio stream. In a stereo audio stream, the left and right channels are interleaved. The Compression Library provides support for both mono and stereo audio. Parameters are used to distinguish between the two data types. Depending on the original source of the audio, it may have other distinguishing characteristics such as the resolution. See IDREF="37303" TYPE="TITLE"Part II, "Digital Audio and MIDI Programming," for more information about audio data formats.LBL="" HELPID=""Image Data FormatsImage data is contained in a frame. You need to supply the height and width of an image frame when using the libcl routines that compress/decompress image and video data. The ordering of pixels within the frame depends upon the source of the data. Top-to-bottom is the default data orientation for Compression Library routines. You can use the CL_ORIENTATION parameter to specify how pixels are ordered.ID="Media5-0ZIN25"The Compression Library works with data that is contained in frames. A frame is defined as a sample at one instant of time so that:1 audio sample:mono 8 bit = 1 bytemono 16 bit= 2 bytesstereo 8 bit = 2 bytesstereo 16 bit = 4 bytes1 video frame:width * height * components * bitsPerComponent/8 = n bytesLBL="" HELPID=""Video Data FormatsVideo data is a stream of sequential frames of image data. Some video formats have special frames called ID="Media5-0ZIN26"keyframes that contain information for a block of frames that is treated as a single unit. There are a variety of video formats. The Compression Library supports a set of formats for all algorithms.Video data can be either color or black-and-white. If you are working with video data, you should be familiar with such terms as component video, composite video, chrominance, luminance, and RGBA data.Implicit ID="Media5-0ZIN27"color space conversion occurs whenever the specified original format does not match the specified internal format, that is, the format that is compressed directly. Conversion from the original format to the internal format occurs on compression, and conversion from the internal format to the original format occurs on decompression. A different original format can be used on decompression than was used on compression.ID="Media5-0ZIN28"ID="Media5-0ZIN29"NoteThe parameter CL_BEST_FIT can be used when compressing to automatically choose the best internal format for a given original format.ID="Media5-0ZIN30"The Compression Library supports these video formats:CL_RGBAID="Media5-0ZIN31"R, G, B, and A data are 8-bit components packed into the 32-bit word as:0xAABBGGRRwhere:AA contains the 1-byte alpha value.BB contains the 1-byte blue value.GG contains the 1-byte green value.RR contains the 1-byte red value.RGBA component values range from 0 to 0xFF (255). For this format, compressionFormat.components should be set to 4.CL_RGBXID="Media5-0ZIN32"R, G, B, and X (don't care) data are packed into the 32-bit word as for CL_RGBA. Note that with this format, only the R, G, and B values are compressed.CL_RGBID="Media5-0ZIN33"R, G, and B data are packed into a 24-bit word. Note that with this format, the RGB triplets may cross the 32-bit word boundaries.CL_RGB332ID="Media5-0ZIN34"R, G, and B data are packed into an 8-bit byte as:0xrrrbbgggwhere:rrr is three bits of red.bb is two bits of blue.ggg is three bits of green.CL_GRAYSCALEID="Media5-0ZIN35"Four 8-bit luminance bytes are packed in a 32-bit word. CL_YID="Media5-0ZIN36"Equivalent to CL_GRAYSCALE.CL_YUVID="Media5-0ZIN37"Three 8-bit components, Y, U, and V, are packed into 24 bits as:0xUUYYVVwhere:UU contains the chroma-blue value.YY contains the luminance value.VV contains the chroma-red value.CL_YCbCrID="Media5-0ZIN38"A synonym for YUV The video specification of YUV and YCbCr dictates a scale factor for each component when converting between these formats. For convenience, the CL defines them as equal.
. Y is for luminance, Cb (chroma-blue), and Cr (chroma-red) are for chroma.CL_YUV422ID="Media5-0ZIN39"Two luminance components are packed into a 32-bit word with one U-V pair. In other words, the chroma components are sampled with half of the horizontal rate of the luma, which is known as 4:2:2 sampling. Two pixels are represented by this 32-bit word as (Y1, U1, V1) and (Y2, U1, V1). The order of the components is:0xU1Y1V1Y2where:U1 contains the chroma-blue value.Y1 contains the first luminance value.V1 contains the chroma-red value.Y2 contains the second luminance value.CL_YUV422DCID="Media5-0ZIN40"(duplicate chroma) The chroma is subsampled by 2 vertically in addition to horizontally, and is packed the same as CL_YUV422, except that U and V are duplicated on the odd lines. CL_IMAGE_WIDTH must be even when using this format. This format is convenient for storing 4:1:1 sampled data, which is analogous to 4:2:2 sampling with the addition of half-sampling of the chroma vertically. Sometimes 4:1:1 is used to indicate full vertical and one-quarter horizontal sampling.IDREF="21121" TYPE="TABLE"Table 23-1 shows the formats that are supported directly, that is, formats that do not require color conversionname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

The Compression Library API has three basic interfaces: ID="Media5-1GS1"still image accesssequential frame accessbuffered random frame accessIn addition, the Compression Library supports Cosmo Compress, an optional hardware JPEG video codec, which connects to the Galileo family of video devices to allow real-time JPEG video capture and playback.In this chapter:IDREF="25228" TYPE="TITLE""Overview of the Compression Library API" describes the three types of interfaces provided by the CL and explains how to use them. It also describes the CL error handling facility.IDREF="73497" TYPE="TITLE""Using the Still Image Interface" explains how to compress still images with a single call.IDREF="82040" TYPE="TITLE""Using the Sequential Frame Interface" explains how to compress or decompress sequential data using a compressor or decompressor.IDREF="82708" TYPE="TITLE""Using the Buffering Interface" explains how to use internal or external buffering to implement random access or multithreaded compression or decompression applications.IDREF="22839" TYPE="TITLE""Programming with the Cosmo Compress JPEG Codec" explains how to add Cosmo Compress support to your application.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="25228"Overview of the Compression Library APIThis section describes how each type of interface is used and provides error handling information.LBL="" HELPID=""Still Image APIThe single image method is designed to make still image compression as simple as possible. It is the simplest, yet most limited of the three. It consists of two calls, one for compression and one for decompression. No interframe compression/decompression, such as the method that takes advantage of similarities between frames in MPEG, is possible with this interface.ID="Media5-1GS2"LBL="" HELPID=""Sequential Access APIThe sequential interface is designed for audio/video-streaming applications where the input is live, or where there is no control over playback and when the amount of compressed data for each frame is known in advance; in fact, an error is reported if insufficient data is passed. This interface is more complex, requiring a series of compress or decompress calls to be encapsulated within an open-close block. Each compressor or decompressor keeps state information appropriate to the selected compression algorithm in parameters that you can query and set.ID="Media5-1GS3"LBL="" HELPID=""Buffered Access APIThe buffered interface is designed for:ID="Media5-1GS4"VCR-like control over the audio/video streammaximum efficiency by buffering compressed data and uncompressed framesblocking and nonblocking accesstransparent buffering for hardware acceleration or for multiprocessor operationmultithreaded applicationsThis interface includes the calls of the sequential interface, plus buffer-management routines to access the compressed data and the uncompressed frame buffers.The buffer management routines allow blocking and nonblocking access and accumulation of compressed data and decompressed frames. The compression or decompression modules can each be placed in separate processes. Separating the processes allows the compression or decompression process to get ahead a few frames, which is advantageous for algorithms such as MPEG, which compress the data using techniques that take advantage of similarities between frames, and it also facilitates hardware acceleration.ID="Media5-1GS5"LBL="" HELPID=""About File I/O and Error HandlingIn the CL, file I/O is handled by the caller. The CL has an error handler that prints error messages to ID="Media5-1GS6"stderr. Most CL routines return a negative error code upon failure.You can override the default error handling routine and establish an alternate compression error handling routine using ID="Media5-1GS7"clSetErrorHandler().The function prototype for clSetErrorHandler() is:CL_ErrFunc clSetErrorHandler(CL_ErrFunc efunc)where:efuncis a pointer to an error handling routine declared as:void ErrorFunc(CLhandle handle, int code, const char* fmt,...)The returned value is a pointer to the previous error handling routine.The code fragment in IDREF="57326" TYPE="TEXT"Example 24-1 demonstrates how to silence error reporting for a section of code.LBL="24-1"Example 24-1 ID="57326"Using a Custom Error Handling Routine #include <cl.h>

...LBL="" HELPID=""ID="73497"Using the Still Image InterfaceA simple interface exists for compressing or decompressing still images with a single call. To compress a still image, use ID="Media5-1GS8"clCompressImage(), which compresses the data from the specified frameBuffer, stores the compressed image in compressedData, and stores its resulting size in compressedBufferSize.Pass to ID="Media5-1GS9"clCompressImage() the compression scheme; the width, height, and format of the image; the desired compression ratio; pointers to reference the buffer containing the image and the buffer that is to store the compressed data; and a pointer to return the size of the compressed data.You should allocate a buffer large enough to store the compressed data. In most cases, a buffer the size of the source image plus the maximum header size, which you can get by calling clQueryMaxHeaderSize(), is sufficient. When calculating the data storage of the source image, you can use the CL macro CL_BytesPerPixel() to determine the number of bytes per pixel for certain packing formats.The function prototypes for the compress and decompress image routines are:int clCompressImage(int compressionScheme, int width,
int height, int originalFormat, float compressionRatio,
void *frameBuffer, int *compressedBufferSizePtr,
void *compressedData)
int clDecompressImage(int decompressionScheme, int width,
int height, int originalFormat,int compressedBufferSize,
void *compressedData, void *frameBuffer)where:compressionSchemeis the compression or decompression scheme to use.widthis the width of the image.heightis the height of the image.originalFormatis the format of the original image to (de)compress. For video, use CL_RGB, CL_RGBX, CL_RGBA, CL_RGB332, CL_GRAYSCALE, CL_YUV, CL_YUV422, or CL_YUV422DC. For audio, use CL_MONO or CL_STEREO_INTERLEAVED.compressionRatiois the target compression ratio. The resulting quality depends on the value of this parameter and on the algorithm that is used. Use 0.0 to specify a nominal value. The nominal values for some of the algorithms are: COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"MVC1LEFT="80" WIDTH="72"5.3:1LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"JPEGLEFT="80" WIDTH="72"15.0:1LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"MPEGLEFT="80" WIDTH="72"48.0:1 frameBufferis a pointer to the frame buffer that contains the uncompressed image data.compressedBufferSizePtris a pointer to the size, in bytes, of the compressed data buffer.

The value pointed to is overwritten by clCompressImage() when it returns the actual size of the compressed data.compressedBufferSizeis the size of the compressed data in bytes.compressedBufferis a pointer to the compressed data buffer.Use ID="Media5-1GS10"clDecompressImage() to decompress an image. clDecompressImage() decompresses the data that is stored in compressedBuffer, whose size is compressedBufferSize, and stores the resulting image in frameBuffer.The values of the state parameters that are used in conjunction with the other compression library calls have no effect on these routines, but their defaults do. The arguments width, height, originalFormat, and compressionRatio function the same as the state parameters by the same names but are given as direct arguments to facilitate the single-command interface.IDREF="94038" TYPE="TEXT"Example 24-2 demonstrates how to compress and decompress a color image using the JPEG algorithm.

A compressor is an abstraction that modularizes compression operations.To compress a sequence of frames:Open a compressor to establish the beginning of a sequence of compression calls.Compress frames one at a time, storing the compressed data after each frame has been compressed.Close the compressor to deallocate the resources associated with that compressor.Each of these steps is discussed in detail in the following sections.LBL="" HELPID=""Opening a CompressorCall ID="Media5-1GS14"clOpenCompressor() to open a compressor for a given algorithm. Its function prototype is:int clOpenCompressor(int scheme, CLhandle *handlePtr)where:schemeis the compression scheme to use.handlePtris a pointer, which is overwritten by the returned handle of the compressor that is used by subsequent calls to identify the compressor.More than one compressor can be open at a time. Use the handle that is returned in handle to identify a specific compressor.LBL="" HELPID=""Compressing FramesAfter a compressor has been opened, call clCompress() to compress the data. Pass to ID="Media5-1GS15"clCompress() the handle returned by clOpenCompressor(), the number of frames to be compressed, and pointers to reference the frame buffer containing the data frames, the size of the data, and the location of the buffer that is to store the compressed data.The function prototype for clCompress() is:int clCompress(CLhandle handle, int numberOfFrames,
void *frameBuffer, int *compressedDataSize,
void *compressedBuffer);where:handleis a handle to the compressornumberOfFramesis the number of frames to compress: generally 1 for video data, an appropriate block size for audio data, or either CL_CONTINUOUS_BLOCK or CL_CONTINUOUS_NONBLOCK in order to continue compression until either the frame buffer is marked done or clCloseCompressor() is called. With CL_CONTINUOUS_NONBLOCK, the call to clCompress() returns immediately while the compression occurs in a separate thread; CL_CONTINUOUS_BLOCK blocks until compression is completed.frameBufferis a pointer to the location of the buffer that contains the data that is to be compressed. Using a NULL argument here invokes the buffered interface that is described in IDREF="82708" TYPE="TITLE""Using the Buffering Interface". An error is reported if no buffer exists. Some compressors allow a value of CL_EXTERNAL_DEVICE, indicating a direct connection to an external audio or video source.compressedDataSizeis a pointer to the returned size of the compressed data in bytes.compressedBufferis a pointer to the location where the compressed data is to be written. Using a NULL argument here invokes the buffered interface that is described in IDREF="82708" TYPE="TITLE""Using the Buffering Interface".Call clCompress() ID="Media5-1GS16"once to compress numberOfFrames sequential frames. clCompress() reads the raw data from the location pointed to by frameBuffer and writes the compressed data to the location pointed to by compressedBuffer. clCompress() returns either the number of frames successfully compressed, or in the case of CL_CONTINUOUS_NONBLOCK, returns SUCCESS immediately.The size of the compressed data is stored in compressedDataSize, even if this size exceeds the COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE state parameter. If COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE is less than the actual size returned by clCompress(), then the data returned in compressedBuffer is not complete. An application-allocated compressed buffer must be at least COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE bytes. This parameter should be determined by calling clGetParams() after the frame buffer dimensions are defined by clSetParams(). It is not required to set the COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE, because the default is the largest possible compressed data size, which is computed from the given parameters.ID="Media5-1GS17"LBL="" HELPID=""Closing a CompressorTo close a compressor, call ID="Media5-1GS18"clCloseCompressor() with the handle of the compressor you wish to close.

clCloseCompressor(handle);LBL="" HELPID=""Decompressing a Sequence of FramesDecompressing sequential data and audio/video streams requires the use of a decompressorID="Media5-1GS20". A decompressor is an abstraction that modularizes decompression operations.To decompress a sequence of frames:Query the stream header to get the compression scheme used.Open a decompressor to establish the beginning of a sequence of decompression calls.Decompress frames one at a time, storing the decompressed data after each frame has been decompressed.Close the decompressor to deallocate the resources associated with that decompressor.Each of these steps is discussed in detail in the following sections.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting Stream InformationTo determine which scheme to pass to the decompressor, use ID="Media5-1GS21"clQueryScheme() to get the scheme from the 16 bytes of the stream header (see IDREF="31534" TYPE="TABLE"Table 24-1 for a list of typical header contents, and ID="Media5-1GS22"IDREF="98792" TYPE="TABLE"Table 24-2 for a list of additional video stream header contents). clQueryScheme() returns the scheme, or the (negative) error code when an error occurs.Once you determine the scheme, you can open the decompressor and read the header using ID="Media5-1GS23"clReadHeader(), which returns the actual size of the header, or zero if none is detected. Use clQueryMaxHeaderSize()ID="Media5-1GS24", which returns the maximum size of the header, or zero if none is detected, to determine the size of the header to send to clReadHeader().

Buffering allows the accumulation of compressed data to be independent of that of decompressed frames. The buffering interface can be used for multithreaded applications.ID="Media5-1GS32"ID="Media5-1GS33"Buffers are implemented as ring buffers in ID="Media5-1GS34"libcl. A ring buffer contains a number of blocks of arbitrary size. It maintains a pointer to the buffer location, a size, and pointers to the ID="Media5-1GS35"Head of newest and ID="Media5-1GS36"Tail of oldest valid data. Separate processes can be ID="Media5-1GS37"producing (adding to the buffer) and ID="Media5-1GS38"consuming (removing from the buffer).IDREF="93526" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 24-1 shows a conceptual drawing of a ring buffer.FILE="Media5-1GS.cgm" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="24-1"Figure 24-1 ID="93526"Ring BufferThe circle represents the ring buffer.

Head marks the location where new data or frames, depending on the buffer type, are inserted. Tail marks the location where the oldest data or frames, depending on the buffer type, are removed.

When it finishes compressing a frame, it updates the frame buffer pointers and returns. clCompress() does not return until compression is complete or until an error occurs.LBL="" HELPID=""Creating Buffered Multiprocess Record and Play ApplicationsIn the examples in the previous section, consuming, compressing or decompressing, and producing have been separated into different sets of calls.

Cosmo Compress is capable of compressing to and decompressing from memory, or directly through a special video connection to Galileo Video options.Cosmo Compress JPEG is a lossy compression scheme based on psychovisual studies of human perception. Picture information that is generally not noticeable is dropped out, reducing the storage requirement anywhere from 2 to 100 times. Cosmo Compress implements a subset of the JPEG standard especially for video-originated images (baseline JPEG, interleaved YCrCb 8-bit components).LBL="" HELPID=""Cosmo Compress BasicsSee the Cosmo Compress Execution Environment Release Notes for important prerequisite information and installation instructions.

When compressing from external video, the timestamp returned represents the time at which the first line of the uncompressed field arrived at the Cosmo Compress board.To get compressed image information:Call clSetParam() to set the CL_ENABLE_IMAGEINFO parameter to TRUE before compressing or decompressing any frames.Call clGetNextImageInfo() to get a structure containing information about the compressed image:int clGetNextImageInfo(CL_Handle handle,                  CLimageInfo *info, int sizeofimageinfo)handlespecifies an open handle which is actively compressing or decompressinginfois a pointer where a CLimageInfo structure is to be placedsizeofimageinfospecifies the size of the CLimageInfo structure in bytesThe CLimageInfo structure is defined in dmedia/cl.h and has the following fields: typedef struct {
    unsigned size; /* size of compressed image in bytes */
    unsigned long long ustime;   /* time in nanoseconds */
    unsigned imagecount;       /*  media stream counter */
    unsigned status;   /* additional status information */
} CLimageInfo;The ustime field returns a meaningful value only when compressing from or decompressing to an external device. The status field is reserved for future use.NoteCurrently, in order to get valid JPEG data, an application using the CL_JPEG_COSMO compressor must enable clGetNextImageInfo() by setting CL_ENABLE_IMAGEINFO, and then read a CLimageInfo structure corresponding to each compressed image, before calling clCompress to read the compressed image data.When using the CL_JPEG_COSMO decompressor, you don't need to read CLimageInfo structures. When clGetNextImageInfo() is enabled, the CL uses a small internal buffer to queue the structures during decompression. When this queue fills, the oldest structures are overwritten by new ones.clGetNextImageInfo() blocks only when it is waiting for the first valid decompressed field to exit the CL_JPEG_COSMO decompressor.LBL="" HELPID=""Memory-to-Memory Compression and DecompressionYou can use Cosmo Compress to compress images from a memory archive to a buffer. For example, you can use Cosmo Compress to compress images from a movie file to a buffer, and then insert the JPEG-compressed images into a movie file to create a compressed movie. Taking this idea a step further, you can then use Cosmo Compress to scale down the images as it decompresses them, in order to display thumbnail images similar to the ones in Movie Player.

LBL="" HELPID=""Compressing and Decompressing Video Through External Connections to Cosmo CompressYou can use Cosmo Compress as a real-time JPEG codec between your application and an external video device. This section explains how to use Cosmo Compress to compress images from an external video connection into memory and decompress JPEG images from memory to a video device.LBL="" HELPID=""Video-to-Memory Compression To capture video from an external video device using Cosmo Compress:Connect the video device to the appropriate port. For example, use either analog port 1 or digital port 1. Video port connections are managed from the videopanel control panel.Open a connection to the video server by calling vlOpenVideo( "" ). Create the video transfer paths.Get the source (VL_SRC) node for the video signal connection by calling vlGetNode(). Get the drain(VL_DRN) node for the Cosmo Compress connection by calling vlGetNode(). Create the path from source to drain by calling vlCreatePath(). Set up the path to share (VL_SHARE) data by calling vlSetupPaths(). TipCosmo Compress is not a video node; it is a separate device. Therefore the VL does not have a Cosmo VLnode for video paths. The port to which Cosmo Compress is connected (for example, the digital video output) is the video drain node. Set the appropriate video synchronization mode. Use slave mode (VL_EV1_SYNC_SLAVE) when capturing from the analog port; use internal mode (VL_SYNC_INTERNAL) when capturing from the digital port.Set the CL parameters for image dimensions, quality factor, and compressed image information (CL_ENABLE_IMAGEINFO).Open a CL_JPEG_COSMO compressor.Call clGetNextImageInfo() to get a structure containing information about the compressed image.Start the video transfer.Use the CL buffered interface to compress frames by calling clCompress() with CL_CONTINUOUS_NONBLOCK as the framecount parameter and CL_EXTERNAL_DEVICE as the frameBuffer parameter.NoteInstead of using CL_CONTINUOUS_NONBLOCK, you can call clCompress() from a separate thread within the program. clCompress() does not return until the transfer is complete.See APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/dmrecord/cosmo_capture.c" PARMS=""cosmo_capture.c
 in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/dmrecord for an example of capturing external video through Cosmo Compress.Video fields entering Cosmo Compress from the direct video connection are captured into an array of field buffers. The field buffers support field widths from 640 to 768 and field heights from 16 to 336. Field dimensions depend on the video timing, as shown in IDREF="25981" TYPE="TABLE"Table 24-4.IDREF="25981" TYPE="TABLE"Table 24-4 shows video field dimensions for the video formats supported by Cosmo Compress.COLUMNS="3"LBL="24-4"Table 24-4 ID="25981"Cosmo Compress Video Field DimensionsLEFT="0" WIDTH="110"Video FormatLEFT="115" WIDTH="110"WIdth (pixels)LEFT="230" WIDTH="110"Height (pixels)LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"NTSCLEFT="115" WIDTH="110"640LEFT="230" WIDTH="110"243LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"PALLEFT="115" WIDTH="110"768LEFT="230" WIDTH="110"288LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"CCIR(525)LEFT="115" WIDTH="110"720LEFT="230" WIDTH="110"243LEFT="0" WIDTH="110"CCIR(625)LEFT="115" WIDTH="110"720LEFT="230" WIDTH="110"288Lines in the field buffers following the end of valid video data are filled with indeterminate data (that is, they are not blacked out). When the compressed image height is less than the height of the incoming video fields, the video fields are clipped from the bottom before they are sent to the compressor. When the compressed image height is greater than the height of the incoming video fields, additional lines of indeterminate data are appended to the valid video data before the data is sent to the compressor. NoteNTSC fields have a height (243 pixels) which is not a multiple of 8. For NTSC capture, you can choose to have your application either throw away 3 lines from the bottom of each field (240 pixel height) or append 5 extra lines to the bottom of each field (248 pixel height) prior to compression. You can scale the captured image to half-size before compressing it. This allows for an additional increase in data compression by factor of 4. Specify vertical decimation by setting the compressed image height (CL_INTERNAL_IMAGE_HEIGHT) to half the size of the uncompressed image height (CL_IMAGE_HEIGHT). Compressed image heights can range from 16 to 168 and uncompressed image heights can range from 32 to 336.Specify horizontal decimation by setting the compressed image width (CL_INTERNAL_IMAGE_WIDTH) to half the size of the uncompressed image width (CL_IMAGE_WIDTH) as indicated in IDREF="65211" TYPE="TABLE"Table 24-5.

The count advances when a new field arrives. If the compression data buffer fills up, then a field will be dropped, but the imagecount continues to increase. An application can thus detect a dropped field by noticing a jump in the imagecount field of more than one. The ustime indicates the time the uncompressed field entered the compressor. LBL="" HELPID=""Memory-to-Video DecompressionThe connections for decompressing from memory to an external video are set up similar to those for capturing video, except that a decompressor is opened. See APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/dmplay/clInit.c" PARMS=""clInit.c
 in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/dmplay for example code that initializes the CL for JPEG decompression (optionally through Cosmo Compress) from memory to external video.Video playback of the decompressed frames requires media synchronization.

 in /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/dmplay for more information.Uncompressed fields leaving the JPEG decompressor may optionally be scaled up by a factor of 2 in the horizontal and/or vertical dimensions. NTSC, PAL or CCIR(525)/CCIR(625) fields are then scanned out of the array of field buffers. Horizontal scaling is performed by pixel replication, vertical scaling is performed by line doubling. If the uncompressed fields leaving the decompressor have fewer lines than the field height required by the NTSC, PAL or CCIR(525)/CCIR(625) connection (after optional pistoling), additional lines of indeterminate (not blacked out) data will be scanned out of the field buffers to pad out bottoms of the uncompressed images. If the uncompressed fields leaving the decompressor have more lines than the NTSC/PAL/CCIR(525)/CCIR(625) field height (after optional pistoling), lines will be clipped from the bottom of the uncompressed images.

Compressed image heights can range from 16 to 168 and uncompressed image heights can range from 32 to 336.During video decompression to an external device, CLimageInfo.imagecount   reflects the count of fields sent by the application to the decompressor. The ustime indicates the time that field left the decompressor. In certain situations, fields are repeated on output, in which case the imagecount will remain the same, but the ustime will increase. Cosmo Compress decompression has a 1 frame delay through Galileo/IndyVideo before the field actually leaves the machine.When transferring to or from external video, the video can be played continuously (default) or single-stepped a field or frame at a time. In either mode, the frame output is composed of either a single field replicated twice or two different fields. Specify the frame control by setting CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_MODE.For continuous transfer, set CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_MODE to CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_AUTO_1_FIELD for the first field in a frame, and CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_AUTO_2_FIELD for the second field in a frame.For manual control, set CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_MODE to CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_MANUAL_1_FIELD, and CL_COSMO_VIDEO_TRANSFER_MANUAL_2_FIELD. In manual video transfer mode, the output frame can be set to either advance or repeat the current frame or field, as specified by CL_COSMO_VIDEO_FRAME_CONTROL.You can control compression or decompression with CL_COSMO_CODEC_CONTROL. Setting CL_COSMO_CODEC_CONTROL to CL_COSMO_STOP halts compression or decompression. If clCompress() or clDecompress() was called with CL_CONTINUOUS_BLOCK, the function returns. If clCompress() or clDecompress() was called with CL_CONTINUOUS_NONBLOCK, the associated thread terminates. LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling JPEG Compressed Image QualityJPEG is a tunable algorithmname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'you can trade quality for compression ratio and vice-versa. You can specify a hint (CL_COMPRESSION_RATIO) for an approximate compression ratio or you can set more explicit quality factors, as described next.The source image is compressed in three basic steps. Data is transformed from spatial to frequency form in eight-by- eight blocks using a discrete cosine transform (DCT). The frequency coefficients are filtered down by a linear quantization. The coefficients are Huffman-encoded into a bit stream. The process is reversed for decompression.The quantization step controls the trade-off between image quality and size. A table called the JPEG quantization table is used to scale each of the 64 DCT coefficients. The luminance (Y) and the chrominance (Cr and Cb) components each use a separate table.The CL provides two methods for controlling image quality from these quantization tables. You can specify an overall JPEG quality factor (CL_JPEG_QUALITY_FACTOR) for scaling the default JPEG quantization tables or you can manually set the quantization tables CL_JPEG_QUANTIZATION_TABLES.The JPEG algorithm does not allow you to specify exact compression ratios (or bit rate targets), so the CL_EXACT_COMPRESSION_RATIO parameter is not supported by the CL JPEG codecs.LBL="" HELPID=""Specifying a JPEG Quality FactorYou can use the CL_JPEG _QUALITY_FACTOR parameter to specify a JPEG quantization table scale factor that represents a rough percentage of the image detail preservation. This is one method to control the image loss and therefore the compression ratio for the Cosmo Compress JPEG algorithm.Each time the quality factor is set, the reference quantization tables are scaled and downloaded into the codec. The formula used to obtain the scale factor is:scalefactor = 50/quality          (quality < 50)
scalefactor = 2 - 2*quality/100;  (otherwise)The default quality is CL_JPEG_QUALITY_DEFAULT, which represents a good-quality compressed image. A quality factor of 1 results in coarse quantization, a high compression ratio, and very poor image quality. A quality factor of 100 results in the finest possible quantization, a low compression ratio (perhaps even image expansion), and near-perfect image quality. The most useful quality factor is typically in the range of 25≠95. To bypass scaling, specify CL_JPEG_QUALITY_NO_SCALE.LBL="" HELPID=""Defining and Using Custom JPEG Quantization TablesYou can customize the JPEG quantization tables by using the CL_JPEG_QUANTIZATION_TABLES parameter. To set the tables, specify an unsigned short *qtables[4] argument. For each j, qtables[j] must either be NULL or point to a unsigned short[64] area of memory that represents a JPEG-baseline quantization table in natural scanning order. These custom tables are then stored as reference tables, and then scaled versions of them based on the current CL_JPEG_QUALITY_FACTOR are downloaded into the codec, becoming the tables associated with the ID j. When getting the value of CL_JPEG_QUANTIZATION_TABLES, the CL allocates the required memory and returns the currently used tables, as indicated by CL_JPEG_COMPONENT_TABLES, scaled by the value of CL_JPEG_QUALITY_FACTOR. Your application is responsible for freeing the memory allocated to return these tables.You can specify the quantization tables on a per-component basis, by using the CL_JPEG_COMPONENT_TABLES parameter. It specifies the IDs of the AC Huffman table, DC Huffman table, and quantization table to be used for each component. Currently, you cannot change this parameter for Cosmo Compressname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

The algorithm affects the data size and quality and the rate of compression and decompression, so it is important to consider how an algorithm will affect the end result and to consider whether a particular algorithm will achieve the desired effect. A certain amount of experimentation may be necessary.If you are interested in a particular quality level, you need to set the compression ratio to achieve that quality; if you are primarily interested in a particular data size or data rate, you need to set the compression ratio to achieve the desired data size or rate.Here are some suggestions for typical application categories:NoteThe performance is quoted for Indigo workstations with 33Mhz MIPSÆ R3000Æ processors only.Algorithms for Multimedia Information Delivery ApplicationsVideoThe key factors to consider when choosing a video compression algorithm for multimedia applications are playback speed, data size or rate, and quality.ID="Media5-2AP2"MPEG gives the best video quality for a given data size or rate, but playback speed is limited by the CPU. MVC1 is usually the best choice if MPEG is not fast enough. If an expensive frame-by-frame VCR is not available, recording in real time to disk is important, which can be done with RTR1.ID="Media5-2AP3"ID="Media5-2AP4"ID="Media5-2AP5"Audioname='mgr' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=109

Algorithms for Telecommunications ApplicationsVideoThe key factors to consider when choosing a video compression algorithm for video/voice mail, video teleconferencing, and other telecommunications applications are the combined compression-decompression speed, data size/rate, and to a lesser extent, quality.ID="Media5-2AP7"MVC1 gives the best result for video of about 10 frames per second for a 160 by 120 frame size at the cost of a very high data rate.

Other features of the algorithms can also be queried by the application at run time. Querying algorithms, rather than having hard-coded setups, makes it possible to have an algorithm-independent interface, which lets you take advantage of future algorithms as they are implemented without redesigning your code.ID="Media5-2AP12"LBL="" HELPID=""Getting a List of AlgorithmsUse ID="Media5-2AP13"clQueryAlgorithms() to get a list of algorithms for the compressor or decompressor identified by handle. clQueryAlgorithms() returns the size of the buffer needed to contain the list of algorithms and their types.If the size of the algorithmTypeBuffer is smaller than the returned value, a partial list of the algorithms and their types is returned, and you must enlarge the algorithmTypeBuffer in order to receive a complete list.The function prototype for clQueryAlgorithms() is:int clQueryAlgorithms ( int algorithmMediaType,

These routines are similar to a set of routines in the audio library. You can get and set parameters, either individually or as a group; however, all of the parameters have reasonable defaults that are algorithm-dependent and need not be set. ID="Media5-2AP20"The Compression Library works with data that is contained in frames. A frame is defined as a sample in time so that:1 audio sample:mono 8 bit = 1 bytemono 16 bit = 2 bytesstereo 8 bit = 2 bytesstereo 16 bit = 4 bytes1 video frame:width * height * components * bitsPerComponent/8 = n bytesLBL="" HELPID=""Compression Library Parameter DefinitionsParameters provide state information about frame characteristics, data formats, and algorithms for each compressor/decompressor.These parameters provide information about image frame dimensions:CL_IMAGE_WIDTHThe spatial width of a sample (not relevant for audio); the video default is 320, and the audio default is 1.CL_IMAGE_HEIGHTThe spatial height of a sample (not relevant for audio); the video default is 240, and the audio default is 1. These parameters describe data formats:CL_ORIGINAL_FORMATOn compression, this is the format of the original audio or video. On decompression, this is the format that you want after decompression. The value is a symbolic constant from one of the following lists, depending on its data type:Video values are: CL_RGB, CL_RGBX (default), CL_RGBA, CL_RGB332, CL_GRAYSCALE, CL_YUV, CL_YUV422, or CL_YUV422DC.Audio values are: CL_MONO or CL_STEREO_INTERLEAVED (default).CL_INTERNAL_FORMATSome video algorithms have several "natural" formats that can be compressed without color space conversion. This parameter allows the selection of one of these formats. The video default is algorithm-specific. Not relevant for audio.CL_COMPONENTSA read-only value, as determined by CL_ORIGINAL_FORMAT, that indicates the number of components in the data. For example, audio is 1 for mono, and 2 for stereo, video is generally 1 for grayscale, and 3 or 4 for color. The audio default is 2; video default is 4.CL_BITS_PER_COMPONENTThe number of bits per component. For example, audio data is either 8-bit or 16-bit, video is generally 8-bit. The audio default is 16; video default is 8.CL_ORIENTATIONSpecifies the orientation of compressed data, which can be either:COLUMNS="2"The orientation of compressed data is always top down. When specifying compression or decompression, the original format (or final format) of the data may be bottom up. Specify this inversion by setting the CL_ORIENTATION parameter to CL_BOTTOM_UP instead of the default.These parameters describe buffer sizes and characteristics:CL_FRAME_BUFFER_SIZEThe maximum size, in bytes, of the frame buffer. If clDecompress() is called with numberOfFrames larger than 1, this value should be the frame size name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180
	TeX='\times ' descr='[times]'numberOfFrames. Because this is almost always true for audio, CL_FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE should be set when doing audio decompression.CL_COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZEThe maximum size of the compressed data buffer. The default is calculated as the maximum possible size, taking into account all the factors such as algorithm, encoding method, data type, and so on. If you want to try to use a smaller buffer, you can set this value explicitly. If clCompress() is called with numberOfFrames larger than 1, this value should be the maximum compressed size of one frame name='times' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=180
	TeX='\times ' descr='[times]'numberOfFrames. Because this is almost always true for audio, CL_COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE should be set when doing audio compression. CL_NUMBER_OF_FRAMESThe number of frames in the sequence.CL_BLOCK_SIZEThe natural block size of the algorithm in samples. It is most efficient to specify numberOfFrames to be a multiple of the block size when calling clCompress() or clDecompress(). CL_PREROLLThe number of blocks of frames that must be supplied to clDecompress() before decompressed frames will be returned.CL_FRAME_RATEThe requested number of frames per second. CL_FRAME_TYPEThe decompressor fills in the frame type when it decompresses a frame.

itCL_ACTUAL_FRAME_INDEXThe frame number of the frame most recently decompressed by clDecompress().These parameters control the compression ratio and/or quality:CL_ALGORITHM_IDA parameter that can be queried to find out the scheme identifier of the algorithm of an open compressor or decompressor.CL_COMPRESSION_RATIOThe target compression ratio. Some algorithms (MVC1, JPEG, and MPEG) are tunable, that is, they allow quality to be traded for compression ratio. CL_EXACT_COMPRESSION_RATIOA flag determines whether the compression ratio is a target or must be exact. Some algorithm implementations, such as for JPEG, can be only approximated and can never be exact. For algorithms that do support it, it is generally kept within a small range that over time is guaranteed to average out to the specified compression ratio.CL_SPEEDThe relative speed of playback. A value of 1.0 for this single-precision floating point value means no change. When this value is greater than 1.0, the algorithm tries to use less CPU time by dropping frames or by reducing the quality.JPEG has the following additional parameters:CL_JPEG_COMPONENT_TABLESSpecifies the IDs of the AC Huffman table, DC Huffman table, and quantization table to be used for each component. Currently, this parameter cannot be changed directly, rather, it is set up automatically for processing the selected CL_INTERNAL_FORMAT. YUV formats use AC huffman table 0, DC huffman table 0, and quantization table 0 for component 0; AC huffman table 1, DC huffman table 1, and quantization table 1 for components 1 and 2. RGB formats use tables AC table 0, DC table 0, and quantization table 0 for all components.CL_JPEG_QUANTIZATION_TABLES Sets or gets the quantization tables to be used. For setting, an unsigned short *qtables[4] argument is specified as the argument to this parameter. For each j, qtables[j] must either be NULL or point to a unsigned short[64] area of memory which represents a JPEG base-line quantization table in natural scan order. The user-specified tables are stored as reference tables, and scaled versions of them based on the current CL_JPEG_QUALITY_FACTOR are downloaded into the codec and become the table associated with the ID j. For getting, the library allocates the memory as described above, and the tables returned to the user are those which are specified by CL_JPEG_COMPONENT_TABLES as being in use and are scaled as indicated by CL_JPEG_QUALITY_FACTOR. The user is responsible for freeing the memory. CL_JPEG_QUALITY_FACTORA JPEG quantization table scale factor that represents a rough percentage of the image detail preservation. This is one method to control the image loss and therefore the          compression ratio for the JPEG algorithm. Each time the quality factor is set, the reference quantization tables are scaled and downloaded into the codec. The formula used to obtain the scale factor is:scalefactor = 50/quality          (quality < 50)
scalefactor = 2 - 2*quality/100;  (otherwise)Using a value of 1 results in coarse quantization, a high compression ratio, and very poor image quality. Using a value of 100 results in the finest possible quantization, a low compression ratio (perhaps even image expansion), and near-perfect image quality. The most useful quality factor is typically in the range of 25≠95. The default quality is CL_JPEG_QUALITY_DEFAULT, which represents a good-quality compressed image. Use the value CL_JPEG_QUALITY_NO_SCALE to bypass scaling.When CL_QUALITY_FACTOR is set, the approximate value of CL_COMPRESSION_RATIO is calculated; when CL_COMPRESSION_RATIO is set, the approximate value of CL_QUALITY_FACTOR is calculated. When decompressing JPEG, clDecompress() fills in this value. The actual compression ratio is determined by the quality factor and the image content and therefore may not be exactly what you expect.MPEG_VIDEO has the following additional parameters:CL_END_OF_SEQUENCEAn end of sequence flag. When the decompressor arrives at the end of the sequence, it sets this flag. The default is FALSE (0). RTR has the following additional parameters:CL_QUALITY_LEVELSelects a quantization table. 6 is the highest compression ratio and therefore the worst quality; 0 (default) is the lowest compression ratio and therefore the highest quality.

The compressor being queried is identified by its handle. Its function prototype is:int clQueryParams(CLhandle handle,int *paramValuebuffer, int maxLength)where:handleis the handle to a compressor or decompressor.paramValuebufferis a pointer to an array of ints into which clQueryParams() can write parameter identifier/parameter type pairs for each parameter associated with the compressor or decompressor. The even (0,2,4,...) entries receive a string that is the parameter identifier. The odd entries (1,3,5,...) receive the parameter type.

If maxLength is zero, then paramValuebuffer is ignored and only the return value is valid.clQueryParams() returns the size of the buffer, in ints, needed to hold all the parameter identifier/parameter type pairs for the compressor or decompressor identified by handle. The parameters are returned in the even locations of paramValuebuffer, and their types are returned in the odd locations.If the size of the paramValuebuffer is smaller than the returned value, a partial list of the parameter identifier/parameter type pairs is returned, making it necessary to enlarge the paramValuebuffer in order to receive a complete list. To avoid this situation, you can obtain the correct size of the buffer by calling clQueryParams() with a NULL buffer pointer and a maxLength of 0 to return the actual buffer length without writing any data.clQueryParams() also reports whether the parameter is one of a set of enumerated types, any integer number within a specific range, or any floating point number within a specific range.

The Compression Library provides the flexibility to evolve with this changing environment by letting you customize and expand libcl. This chapter explains how to add your own algorithms to the library and how to add new state parameters to these algorithms to provide capabilities that are not addressed by the standard set of parameters. To ensure capability across applications, you must use the existing interface paradigm for your custom implementations; you cannot add to or change the API.ID="Media5-3UP1"In this chapter:IDREF="81540" TYPE="TITLE""Adding Custom Algorithms to the Compression Library" explains how to add algorithms to the CL.IDREF="24443" TYPE="TITLE""Adding Custom Parameters to the Compression Library" explains how to add parameters to the CL.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="81540"Adding Custom Algorithms to the Compression LibraryFor compatibility, an algorithm that is to be added to the Compression Library must meet these requirements:Provide support for all three types of interfaces (single-image, sequential, and buffered) through the clCompress() and clDecompress() entry points.Support interfaces for the query routines clGetParams() and clSetParams().Provide the ability to specify the worst-case size of the compressed data through the CL_COMPRESSED _BUFFER_SIZE parameter so that the application can then allocate buffers of appropriate size.Report errors using clError().Use ID="Media5-3UP2"clAddAlgorithm() to add your own compression algorithms to libcl. clAddAlgorithm() adds compression algorithms to the library by passing function pointers to routines that are unique for each algorithm.

The function must have the same arguments as clSetParams().compressionSchemeis a pointer to a value that is to receive the compression scheme identifier.Argument bounds checking is performed before these functions are called. For example, if clCompress() is called, each argument is checked for validity before passing control to the function passed to clAddAlgorithm().Added algorithms must support interfaces to clGetParams() and clSetParams(), which are supplied to clAddAlgorithm(). The algorithm implementation is notified of changes to, or requests for, parameter values through these routines. This allows complete control of parameters to constrain or report errors upon setting or to calculate only when requested.Algorithms and parameters, once added, will show up when queried with clQueryAlgorithms() and clQueryParams() respectively.The algorithm implementation is required to specify the worst-case size of the compressed data for a frame through the CL_COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE parameter. This value must be calculated every time it is requested, using the current value of other parameters such as CL_IMAGE_WIDTH, CL_HEIGHT, and CL_INTERNAL_FORMAT. An algorithm can also specify a value for its most natural number of frames to process at a time in the CL_BLOCK_SIZE parameter.The number of blocks that need to be processed before decompressed data begins to emerge is specified in the CL_PREROLL parameter. For algorithms with a fixed compression ratio, this may allow the application to use the sequential interface. Use ID="Media5-3UP3"clSetUnique() and ID="Media5-3UP4"clGetUnique() to allow the algorithm implementation to store and retrieve algorithm-specific information that is associated with each instantiation of a compressor or decompressor.When clOpenCompressor() or clOpenDecompressor() is called, the implementation sets up the unique pointer that gets stored associated with the compressor handle. Other functions that require the information get it using that handle. clSetUnique() returns the previous unique pointer. clGetUnique() returns the current unique pointer.The function prototypes are:void * clSetUnique(CLhandle handle, void *unique)void * clGetUnique(CLhandle handle)where:handle is a handle to a compressor or decompressor.uniqueis a pointer to unique data that is associated with handle.When adding an algorithm, use ID="Media5-3UP5"clSetMin() and ID="Media5-3UP6"clSetMax() to set its minimum and maximum values, respectively. For example, you may need to set the bounds that define the legal range of the compression ratio. These settings take effect when either clOpenCompressor() or clOpenDecompressor() is called.When adding an algorithm, use clSetDefault() to set defaults. For example, you may need to specify a default compression ratio.

For example, if insufficient data is passed into the compressedData or frameBuffer parameters, you don't want the application to block and wait forever for data.To avoid this situation for compressedData, you can use ID="Media5-3UP9"clReadData(), which provides an interface that removes the need for the application to know about the discontinuity of the compressed data caused by using a ring buffer. Its function prototype is:int clReadData(CLbufferHdl bufferHdl, int requestedDataSize,
void **compressedData)where:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="93"bufferHdlLEFT="100" WIDTH="241"is a handle to a compressor/decompressor.LEFT="0" WIDTH="93"requestedDataSizeLEFT="100" WIDTH="241"is the size of the requested data.LEFT="0" WIDTH="93"compressedData LEFT="100" WIDTH="241"is a pointer to the returned pointer to the compressed 
data.Because it is often not known what the size of the compressed data is, clReadData() allows the algorithm to request data of arbitrary size, such as the next piece of data that it knows it needs. When the requested data crosses a discontinuity, it is automatically pieced together in a temporary buffer. A pointer to this temporary buffer is returned. If the size of the requested data is larger than what is present in the buffer, the routine blocks until the data arrives. Alternatively, if the compressed data were passed directly to clDecompress(), no more data would arrive, no matter how long it waited and whatever data was available would be returned.clReadData() calls clQueryValidData() and clUpdateTail(dataHdl). It blocks (unless the compressed data was passed directly to clDecompress()) until the requested amount of data has accumulated and, if necessary (at the end of the ring buffer), copies the data into a temporary buffer, to guarantee one contiguous buffer.clReadData() returns the actual number of bytes read. clDone() returns the actual number of bytes updated. The requested data size is always returned unless there is an error. If the data requested crosses the discontinuity from the end to the beginning of the ring buffer, a temporary buffer is automatically created, the data from the ring buffer is copied to it, and its address is returned in the compressedData argument.An algorithm has two parts: the compressed data and the bitstream that encapsulates it. For some algorithms, such as JPEG and MPEG, the bitstream is fairly complex and must be parsed in very small segments. clReadData() is designed to be very efficient and can be used to read many small segments of a few bytes if so desired.Use ID="Media5-3UP10"clDone() to update the consumed data read by clReadData(). Its function prototype is:int clDone(CLbufferHdl bufferHdl, int amountToUpdate)where:bufferHdlis a handle to a compressor or decompressor.requestedDataSizeis the size of the requested data.compressedData is a pointer to the returned pointer to the compressed data.amountToUpdateis the amount that was consumed from the last read and therefore needs to be updated with a call to clUpdateTail(). If -1 is passed, the amount returned by the last call to clReadData() is used.In each call to clReadData(), clUpdateTail() is called to release data from the previous call to clReadData(), and clQueryValid() is called to get the new data. clDone() is used at the end of the decompress routine (just before returning) to call clUpdateTail() for data used from the last read.New algorithms should report errors with clError(). Generally, the format string starts with the routine name within which the error occurred, followed by a description of the error.The buffer architecture for adding algorithms is shown in IDREF="92916" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 26-1.

The Movie Library has three loop modes:nonlooping (play once through)ID="Media6-1GS9"looping (continuous play)swinging (repeatedly playing forward then backward)LBL="" HELPID=""Movie Library Programming ModelThe Movie Library programming model consists of:ID="Media6-1GS10"movie instances, which are handles to movie filestracks, which contain audio or imagesparameter-value lists, which contain movie and track propertiesA movie instance is a handle that allows you to read, write, edit, and play a movie file. It contains information about the different tracks (audio and image) in a movie and is identified by a movie ID similar in nature to a file descriptor. An application can create several movie instances at once.ID="Media6-1GS11"LBL="" HELPID=""Movie File FormatsThe Movie Library provides a file-format-independent API and lets you convert movies from one format to another. Currently supported formats are the Silicon Graphics movie format and the Apple Computer QuickTime movie format.ID="Media6-1GS12"LBL="" HELPID=""Silicon Graphics Movie FormatsSilicon Graphics uses a proprietary movie file format that has evolved over time to the current 3.0 version. You can read movies that use previous versions (1.0 and 2.0) of the file formatname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'for example, movies that were created using the prerelease alphas of the Movie Library or previous releases of Movie Makername='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'but the Movie Library writes only Silicon Graphics version 3.0 movie files.ID="Media6-1GS13"The Silicon Graphics version 3. 0 movie format is a parameterized file format with data that is normally interleaved. It currently consists of a single image track and an optional audio track.LBL="" HELPID=""Apple Computer QuickTime File FormatSee IDREF="12291" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 31, "Using the Movie Library with QuickTime Movies," for information on working with QuickTime movies and on using the optional Silicon Graphics QuickTime Compressor Library, which provides Movie Library support for both Apple Animation and Apple Video compression.See Inside Macintosh: QuickTime for information about developing QuickTime applications, and see the QuickTime Starter Kit User's Guide for information on how to use the Apple QuickTime utilities on the Macintosh.LBL="" HELPID=""Deciding Which Format to UseThe destination system determines which movie format to choose when writing the final version of a movie file. Use the QuickTime format only if you require cross-platform compatibility between Silicon Graphics and Apple Macintosh computers.LBL="" HELPID=""Developing a Movie Library ApplicationThis section provides a nutshell description of how to develop a Movie Library application, including compiling and debugging instructions.ID="Media6-1GS14"ID="Media6-1GS15"A good way to get started with the Movie Library is to look at the sample programs in the /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/movie directory. They demonstrate creating, editing, playing, and getting information about movies. See IDREF="98659" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 32, "Using the Movie Library Sample Programs," for complete descriptions of the sample programs.LBL="" HELPID=""Outline for Developing a Movie Library ApplicationFollow these steps to develop a Movie Library application:Open an existing movie file by calling either mvOpenFile(), mvOpenMem(), or mvOpenFD() or create a new movie instance by calling mvCreateFile(), as described in IDREF="61830" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 29, "File I/O and Editing Movies with the Movie Library."Once you have a movie instance, you can find existing tracks, add tracks to the movie, and delete tracks from the movie. If, in step 1, you created a new movie rather than open an existing movie, you must add an image track to it if one does not already exist.Read and write images and audio from and to the movie tracks using the Movie Library file I/O functions, such as mvReadFrames() and mvInsertFrames() that are described in IDREF="61830" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 29.Use the Movie Library editing functions to efficiently implement editing tasks such as deleting part of a movie by calling mvDeleteFrames(), and copying data from one movie to another by calling mvPasteFrames(). Editing is described in IDREF="61830" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 29.To play a movie, configure a playback window and use mvBindWindow() to associate a movie with the playback window. You can play more than one movie simultaneously, in separate windows or in the same window. Playback is described in IDREF="30953" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 30, "Playing Movies with the Movie Library." You can't edit a movie that you have opened for playback, so write the file before attempting to play it.When you have finished with a movie, call mvClose() to destroy the movie instance.LBL="" HELPID=""Compiling and Linking a Movie Library ApplicationMovie Library applications must include the movie.h header file to obtain definitions for the library. When compiling your Movie Library application, follow these linking requirements in the order specified:ID="Media6-1GS16"-lmovie -ldmedia -lcl -lawareaudiowhere:-lmovielinks with the Movie Library (libmovie)-ldmedialinks with the DM Library (libdmedia), which provides parameter setting and ring buffering capabilities-lcllinks with the Compression Library, which provides compression capability-lawareaudiolinks with the part of the Compression Library that provides Aware audio compression-decompression (codec) support. The part of the CL that provides Aware software codecs requires separate linking to accommodate end-user licensing. Currently, applications are required to link with this library even if it is not used, but licensing is optional for the end user.If your application uses the Movie Library to play movies, you must add the following to the end of the link line:-lgl -laudio -lX11 where:-lgllinks with the IRIS GL-laudiolinks with the Audio Library-lX11links with the X11 libraryLBL="" HELPID=""Debugging a Movie Library ApplicationThe Movie Library has two facilities designed to assist you in debugging your application:ID="Media6-1GS17"ID="Media6-1GS18"a debugging version of the Movie Library, libmovie_d.a, which checks for improper usage of the Movie Library, such as out-of-bounds values and invalid parametersID="Media6-1GS19"environment variables that allow you to emulate certain types of failures such as I/O errors, without actually causing failuresLBL="" HELPID=""Using the Debugging Version of the Movie LibraryThe debugging version of the Movie Library checks for violations by setting assertions that rigidly state the requirements for a parameter or value. One typical assertion, worded in standard English, is: "Check that the current frame number is within the bounds of the number of frames in the movie," which is more precisely stated in the following assertion:ID="Media6-1GS20"ASSERT( 0 <= frame < trackLength, "Frame number out of range")To use the debugging version of the library, link with libmovie_d.a as follows:-lmovie_dand then run your program.ID="Media6-1GS21"Your application will abort with an error message if it fails an assertion. The message explains the situation that caused the error, and by implication or by explicit description, suggests a corrective action.When you have finished debugging your application, you should relink with the nondebugging library, libmovie.a, because the runtime checks imposed by the debugging library cause an undesirable performance and size overhead for a packaged application.LBL="" HELPID=""Emulating I/O FailuresWhen attempting to read data from a device such as a CD-ROM drive or over the network, two types of problems can occur:ID="Media6-1GS22"ID="Media6-1GS23"ID="Media6-1GS24"ID="Media6-1GS25"lost connectionsname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190

Global movie properties apply to a movie as a whole; track properties apply only to tracks. Tracks have general properties that apply to all types of tracks, and specific properties that depend on the track medium.ID="Media6-1GS28"ID="Media6-1GS29"ID="Media6-1GS30"ID="Media6-1GS31"ID="Media6-1GS32"Movie and track properties are stored in parameters, some of which you can set, others of which are read-only, because they are computed by the Movie Library from available information. You can also define your own parameters to represent properties not provided by the Movie Library.This section explains how to set and get movie and track parameters using the universal mvSetParams() and mvGetParams() routines; then it explains how to use the Movie Library convenience routines for setting and getting individual movie and track parameters and for setting up defaults.LBL="" HELPID=""Setting and Getting Movie and Track ParametersThe type MVid is used for both movies and for tracks so that universal set and get functions can work on both movies and tracks. The Movie Library also provides convenience routines for setting and getting movie parameters, described in IDREF="99863" TYPE="TITLE""Setting and Getting Global Movie Properties", and setting and getting track parameters, described in IDREF="21924" TYPE="TITLE""Setting and Getting Track Properties".To set or change a group of parameters for a movie or track, make a parameter-value list containing the names of the parameters you want to set and the values you want them to have, then pass this list to ID="Media6-1GS33"mvSetParams().

To retrieve a list of the current parameters for a given movie or track, call mvGetParams(). Its function prototype is:ID="Media6-1GS34"DMparams* mvGetParams ( MVid movieOrTrack )mvGetParams() returns the parameter list associated with the given movie or track. For movies, the parameter list contains the movie property settings: file format, looping mode, and so on. For tracks, the parameter list contains information about the format of the data in the track.NoteThe application should not call dmParamsDestroy() on the returned parameter-value list. The Movie Library reuses the same structure for each call to mvGetParams().

The most commonly used compression schemes for movies to be played on Silicon Graphics computers are MVC1 and MVC2; QT_VIDEO is frequently used for QuickTime movies to be played on a Macintosh computer.ID="Media6-1GS158"ID="Media6-1GS159"ID="Media6-1GS160"The Movie Library supports image compression through the Compression Library. The compression methods that have been thoroughly tested with the Movie Library are UNCOMPRESSED, MVC1, MVC2, RLE24, and JPEG. You can also use the QuickTime compression schemes, QT_VIDEO and QT_ANIM, in QuickTime and Silicon Graphics movies if you have purchased and installed the Silicon Graphics QuickTime Compressor Library.To get the image compression scheme, call mvGetImageCompression().

uncompressed images until the final movie is produced, at which time the images can be 
compressed. Repeatedly compressing, decompressing, and then recompressing images 
reduces the image quality.ID="Media6-1GS165"LEFT="0" WIDTH="105"MVC1LEFT="110" WIDTH="399"This is a good general-purpose compression scheme. It is a color-cell compression 
technique that works well for video, but can cause fuzzy edges in high-contrast animation.ID="Media6-1GS166"LEFT="0" WIDTH="105"MVC2LEFT="110" WIDTH="399"Provides results similar to MVC1 in terms of image quality. MVC2 compresses the data 
more than MVC1, but takes longer to perform the compression. Playback is faster for 
MVC2, because there is less data to read in, and decompression is faster than for MVC1.ID="Media6-1GS167"LEFT="0" WIDTH="105"RLE24LEFT="110" WIDTH="399"This is a lossless compression method that uses run-length encoding (RLE). Run-length 
encoding compresses images by storing a color and its run-length (the number of pixels of 
that color) every time the color changes. It is a good technique for animations where there 
are large areas that have identical colors.ID="Media6-1GS168"LEFT="0" WIDTH="105"JPEGLEFT="110" WIDTH="399"JPEG is designed for still images and is usable, but slow, for video. JPEG is typically used 
to compress each still frame during the writing or editing process, with the intention being 
to apply another type of compression to the final version of the movie or to leave it 
uncompressed. JPEG works better on high-resolution, continuous-tone images such as 
photographs, than on crisp-edged, high-contrast images like line drawings. ID="Media6-1GS169"LEFT="0" WIDTH="105"QT_VIDEOLEFT="110" WIDTH="399"This is the compression used for QuickTime movies that contain video. Like MVC1,

Similarly, you can't play a movie that has been opened for writing.ID="Media6-2IO15"Before opening the movie, the file pointer associated with the file descriptor should be positioned at the beginning of the movie file. If the movie data is embedded within a file, such as an application-specific file format containing a movie as a data chunk, use the IRIX ID="Media6-2IO16"lseek() system call (see the lseek(2) man page) to seek the file descriptor to the beginning of the movie data.

Its function prototype is:void mvSetPlaySpeed ( MVid movieid, double newplayspeed )where:newplayspeedis an integer (for speeding up playback) or the reciprocal of an integer (for slowing down playback)For example, if you specify a newplayspeed of 2.0, the movie plays twice as fast as it normally would. If you specify a negative value for newplayspeed, the movie plays in reverse. You can measure the resulting frame rate by calling mvGetActualFrameRate(), as described in IDREF="48206" TYPE="TITLE""Measuring the Current Frame Rate".For movies with audio, the Movie Library attempts to resample the audio to match the requested playback speed. This changes the pitch of the audio.

}LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling the Frame Display ManuallyThe disadvantage of the automatic   mvGrabIrisGL() ≠ mvReleaseIrisGL() method is that you can't really synchronize the graphics and movie displays, so some things might not display exactly when you want them to.This section describes a method that lets you disable the Movie Library's automatic display so that your application can control the display of movie frames. When you have explicit control over the display of movie frames, you can tell the Movie Library exactly when to show a frame. This technique lets you draw IRIS GL graphics on top of the movie frame.To have your application (rather than the Movie Library) control the display of movie frames, call mvSetFrameDisplay(DM_FALSE). Its function prototype is:void mvSetFrameDisplay ( DMboolean showframes )where:showframesis either DM_TRUE, to allow automatic frame display, or DM_FALSE, to disable automatic frame display for all open moviesTo retrieve the current frame display setting, call mvGetFrameDisplay(). Its function prototype is:DMboolean mvGetFrameDisplay ( void )When you disable the frame display, you have to tell the Movie Library when to display a frame by calling mvShowCurrentFrame() for every frame that you want to display. Its function prototype is:void mvShowCurrentFrame ( MVid movieid )To play a movie with manual frame display, you should include MV_EVENT_FRAME events in your event mask and call mvShowCurrentFrame() in response to those events.Another way to use mvShowCurrentFrame() is to repaint a movie frame in response to an expose event from the window manager. See IDREF="10876" TYPE="TITLE""Handling X Window Events" for more details.You must use one of the two methods described in this section if you want to draw with the IRIS GL while using the Movie Library. The IRIS GL and the Movie Library use separate threads of execution, and the routines discussed in this section supply internal synchronization between the processes. The results of any other method of combining graphics and movies are unpredictable. See Appendix E, "Using Graphics and Share Groups," in the Graphics Library Programming Guide for more information.Hint Advanced programmers might want to turn off the frame display in order to use a double-buffered RGB window. In this case, you have to create a window with the graphics configuration that you want, and you must call swapbuffers() from the GL and mvShowCurrentFrame() from the Movie Library yourself for every frame. This method is only for special cases; it is not the recommended way to combine graphics and movies.

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="31364"Handling EventsIf you've used the select() or poll() system calls, or X event handling, the Movie Library event handling routines will be familiar to you. Even if your application has no user interface, it is recommended that you implement movie event handling because it is the best way to find out about system or I/O errors that occur while a movie is playing.The Movie Library has an event queue, similar to the X event queue, that stores movie events such as playing a frame, stopping playback, and errors. One queue stores movie events for all currently open movies by storing the identifier of the movie instance responsible for an event as part of the event.The Movie Library event queue is separate from the X event queue; so if your application handles X events as well as movie events, you'll probably want to create two separate functions, one for handling X events and one for handling movie events, and call them both from main(). To add movie event handling to your application, follow these basic steps:Choose which movie events you want to process by creating an event mask, as described in IDREF="91960" TYPE="TITLE""Preparing an Event Mask".Get the file descriptor associated with the movie event queue, as described in IDREF="68133" TYPE="TITLE""Getting a File Descriptor for the Movie Event Queue".Use one of the following methods to listen for movie and X11 events.If you are using Xlib, prepare a file descriptor set that contains both the Movie Library and X11 file descriptors using the FD_SET macro, and then code a select() loop that listens for movie events and X events, as described in IDREF="69213" TYPE="TITLE""Preparing a File Descriptor Set".If you are using Xt or IRIS IM, pass the Movie Library file descriptor to the X toolkit using XtAppAddInput(3Xt). This call associates an Xt callback function that you have written for your application with the Movie Library file descriptor. You can then process movie events inside this Xt callback, which gets called whenever one or more events appear on the Movie Library event queue.As long as there are events on the queue, keep processing them.These steps are described in detail in the sections that follow.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="91960"Preparing an Event MaskAn event mask specifies which events the application is interested in processing.

select(...);

}LBL="" HELPID=""ID="69213"Preparing a File Descriptor SetFile descriptor sets provide a way for an application to wait for available input from several files at once. The Movie Library event queue is separate from the X11 event queue, so you must obtain the file descriptor for each queue and put them both into a file descriptor set.To get the file descriptor corresponding to the X11 event queue for a specified display, use the Xlib ConnectionNumber(3X) macro.After you have obtained file descriptors for the movie event queue and the X11 event queue, put them into a file descriptor set using the FD_SET macro.IDREF="93840" TYPE="TEXT"Example 30-8 shows how to prepare a file descriptor set.LBL="30-8"Example 30-8 ID="93840"Preparing a File Descriptor Setstatic DMstatus setupFDSet( Display *dpy, int *movieFD,

}The structure of this code outline and the reasoning behind it are explained in the sections that follow.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="94613"Waiting for Movie EventsWhen creating a movie event loop, it is important that you process all the events on the queue to prevent it from stalling.The Movie Library provides the mvPendingEvents() call to check the queue for events, with which you can create a while loop. Its function prototype is:int mvPendingEvents ( void )You must use the while statement to set up the loop properly; don't use an if statement.When your application wakes up to handle movie events, there may be more than one event in the queue. It is critical that you process all the events in the queue before waiting for more events. As long as events are pending, your application should keep getting events from the queue until it is empty.LBL="" HELPID=""Getting Movie Events from the QueueTo extract the next event from the queue, call mvNextEvent(). Its function prototype is:void mvNextEvent ( MVevent* eventreturn )where:eventreturnis a pointer into which the next event is returnedYou can determine which event is waiting next in the queue, without popping it off the queue, by "peeking" at the next event. To peek at the next event, call mvPeekEvent(). Its function prototype is:void mvPeekEvent ( MVevent* eventreturn )where:eventreturnis a pointer into which the next event is returned without being removed from the queueLBL="" HELPID=""Examining Movie EventsYou can query the fields in the event structure to get specific information about an event, such as the event type. After you know what type of event it is, you can use the structure definitions for the specific event types to extract further information, such as when or why the event occurred.The first field of every event is a type field, which lets you query for the event type without knowing it in advance. After determining the event type, you can examine the fields for each type of event to extract specific information about the event. The typical way to code this is with a switch statement.IDREF="14640" TYPE="TEXT"Example 30-9 is an excerpt from APP="/usr/sbin/jot /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/movie/manymovie/manymovieEvents.c" PARMS=""manymovieEvents.c

Silicon Graphics also provides a separate option, the QuickTime Compressor Library, under license from Apple Computer, Inc. for use with the Movie Library, that supports Apple Animation and Apple Video compression for QuickTime movies.NoteTo use the Apple Animation and Apple Video compression discussed in this chapter, you must purchase and install the Silicon Graphics QuickTime Compressor Library. NoteApple QuickTime software for the Macintosh that is mentioned in this chapter is available from Apple Computer, Inc. in the Apple QuickTime Starter Kit. LBL="" HELPID=""QuickTime BasicsThis section presents basic concepts for using QuickTime movies with the Movie Library.QuickTime is an Apple Macintosh system software extension that can be installed in the Macintosh to extend its capabilities so as to allow time-based (audio, video, and animation) data for multimedia applications.QuickTime movies store and play picture tracks and soundtracks independently of each other, analogous to the way the Movie Library stores separate image and audio tracks. You can't work with pictures and sound as separate entities using the QuickTime Starter Kit utilities on the Macintosh, but you can use the Silicon Graphics Movie Library to work with the individual image and audio tracks in a QuickTime movie.LBL="" HELPID=""QuickTime SoundQuickTime movie soundtracks are playable on both Macintosh and Silicon Graphics computers, but each has its own unique audio data format, so audio playback is most efficient when using the native data format and rate for the computer on which the movie is playing.When playing a QuickTime movie soundtrack on a Silicon Graphics computer, the Movie Library chooses the nearest appropriate audio sample rate during playback and file format conversion of nonnative movies, so no performance penalty is incurred for rate conversion. This may change the pitch of some sounds slightly, but usually not enough to cause an audible difference. The Movie Library supports 8-bit and 16-bit uncompressed audio in either two's complement or unsigned format. The native rates for Silicon Graphics audio hardware are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 32000, 44100, and 48000 Hz.When playing a QuickTime movie soundtrack on a Macintosh, the Macintosh QuickTime software converts nonnative audio to the native Macintosh 8-bit format and performs the necessary rate conversions for playing the nonnative soundtrack; but if you use the Movie Library to write audio data to a QuickTime movie that is intended for playback only on the Macintosh, use a format and sampling rate suitable for the Macintosh. QuickTime supports the AIFF sound file format and both signed and unsigned audio, at any rate up to 65 KHz. The native format for Macintosh audio hardware is 8-bit, unsigned audio at either 11127 Hz or 22254 Hz.LBL="" HELPID=""QuickTime CompressionThe Macintosh QuickTime system software extension includes five compressors, two of which are compatible with the Movie Library:Apple None (uncompressed)Apple Photo (JPEG standard)and two of which are compatible with the Movie Library only when you purchase and install the Silicon Graphics QuickTime Compressor Library:Apple AnimationApple VideoYou can use a QuickTime movie saved with either Apple Animation or Apple Video compression with the Movie Library if you have purchased and installed the Silicon Graphics QuickTime Compressor Library; otherwise, you must save the movie without compression or use JPEG.When creating QuickTime movies on a Macintosh for use with the Movie Library, you can select the compression settings using one of the following methods:Use the Macintosh QuickTime Movie Recorder, which gives you two options for compressing a movie:accepting the default setting, "Use Simple Compression," which automatically applies Apple Video compression when you save the movieselecting an appropriate type of compression from the Compression Settings dialog box and then choosing "Compress" from the Movie menu before saving the movieUse the Macintosh QuickTime Movie Converter to change compression settings for existing moviesCompression settings and the applications for which each setting is best suited are summarized in the sections that follow.LBL="" HELPID=""Apple NoneApple None creates an uncompressed movie and can be used to change the number of colors in the images and/or the recording quality. Both the number of colors and the recording quality can affect the size of the movie.To create an uncompressed QuickTime movie on the Macintosh, click on the "Apple None" choice in the QuickTime Compression Settings dialog box.NoteBecause the Macintosh compresses QuickTime movies by default, you must set the compression to Apple None and save the movie again to create an uncompressed movie. LBL="" HELPID=""Apple PhotoApple Photo uses the JPEG standard. The Movie Library supports the JPEG standard through the Compression Library. JPEG is best suited for compressing individual still frames, because decompressing a JPEG image can be a time-consuming task, especially if the decompression is performed in software. JPEG is typically used to compress each still frame during the writing or editing process, with the intention to apply another type of compression to the final version of the movie or to leave it uncompressed. JPEG works better on high-resolution continuous-tone images, such as photographs, than on crisp-edged, high-contrast images like line drawings.LBL="" HELPID=""Apple AnimationApple Animation uses a lossy run-length encoding (RLE) method, which compresses images by storing a color and its run-length (the number of pixels of that color) every time the color changes. Apple Animation is not a true lossless RLE method because it stores colors that are close to the same value as one color. This method is most appropriate for compressing images such as line drawings that have highly contrasting color transitions and few color variations.LBL="" HELPID=""Apple VideoApple Video uses a method developed by Apple Computer whose objective is to decompress and display movie frames as fast as possible. It compresses individual frames and works better on movies recorded from a video source than on animations.NoteThe Apple Video compressor has a restriction that the image width and height be a multiple of 4. Before transferring a movie from a Macintosh to a Silicon Graphics computer, make sure that the image size is a multiple of 4. LBL="" HELPID=""QuickTime Frame Differencing (Keyframes)QuickTime provides a feature called frame differencing, which allows you to save only the changes from one movie frame to the next, rather than store each individual frame for the entire movie. When frame differencing is used, the entire contents of every nth frame are compressed and stored in a keyframe, while only the differences from frame to frame are stored for the frames between keyframes. (On the Macintosh, you enable frame differencing by clicking on the "Key frame every n frames" box in the Motion area of the Compression Settings dialog box.)Reducing the time between keyframes increases the performance when scrubbing to a particular frame (because of the increased likelihood of landing on a keyframe) but increases the size of the movie.You can open and play keyframe movies with the Movie Library. You can't use the mvPasteFrames() editing function to paste frames into the middle of a keyframe movie because the Movie Library does not support the recomputing of frame differencing. For the same reason, you cannot delete frames from a keyframe movie. To create a movie using Apple Animation or Apple Video, you must use mvInsertFrames() to add the frames in order from beginning to end.LBL="" HELPID=""Movie Library QuickTime Compatibility RequirementsQuickTime movies must be single-fork and self-contained in order to be compatible between Apple Macintosh and Silicon Graphics computers. This section describes how to make QuickTime movies that meet these requirements.LBL="" HELPID=""Making a Single-fork MovieFiles on an Apple computer are double-fork, containing both a data fork and a resource fork. Only Apple computers use the double-fork file system; the file system on Silicon Graphics computers does not use double-fork files. Macintosh computers convert a double-fork file into a single-fork file by writing the resource fork into the data fork. You must perform this conversion on the Macintosh for any movie files that you plan on using with the Movie Library before transferring them to the Silicon Graphics computer.To make a single-fork movie on the Macintosh:Click on the "Playable on non-Apple computers" box in the QuickTime Movie Converter Save dialog box (see the QuickTime Starter Kit User's Guide for details).Equivalently, if you are writing an application on a Macintosh using the Apple QuickTime developer kit, call the Movie Toolbox PutMovieIntoDataFork function in that application to write the movie into a single-fork file before using it in a Movie Library application (see Inside Macintosh: QuickTime for details).LBL="" HELPID=""Making a Self-contained MovieApple QuickTime movie utilities offer two ways of saving a QuickTime movie file on the Macintosh: Save normallyMake movie self-containedA QuickTime movie that has been saved on the Macintosh using the "Save normally" feature contains movie synchronization information, such as the location and sequence of frames in the movie, but does not itself contain the actual movie data. The movie data could have been stored in one or more separate files on the disk, on CD-ROM, or on a remote computer accessible from the network. Such a movie is said to have dependencies, because it depends on being able to locate and use other files that make up the movie. You cannot use this type of movie with the Movie Library.Only self-contained (also called "flattened") QuickTime movie files are compatible with the Movie Library. Self-contained QuickTime movies have both the synchronization information and the movie data in one file.You can use the Macintosh Movie Info window to determine whether an existing movie is self-contained. If the movie is self-contained, nothing will appear in the box under "Uses data from one other file." If anything does appear in this box, you need to convert the movie to a self-contained file.You must convert any movie files that you plan on using with the Movie Library to self-contained movies on the Macintosh before transferring them to the Silicon Graphics computer, using one of the following methods:Click on "Make movie self-contained" from the Save dialog box that appears when you select "Save" or "Save as" from the Macintosh File menu of the QuickTime Movie Player or Movie Recorder. Because the Macintosh default is "Save normally," you must specify "Make movie self-contained" when saving any QuickTime movie that you plan on using with the Movie Library. To convert an existing QuickTime movie, use the Macintosh QuickTime Movie Converter to open the movie, select "Make movie self-contained," and then save the movie.Equivalently, if you are writing a Macintosh application using the Apple QuickTime developer kit, call the Movie Toolbox FlattenMovieData function in that application to make the movie file self-contained before using it in a Movie Library application.LBL="" HELPID=""Transferring Files Between Macintosh and Silicon Graphics ComputersYou can transfer QuickTime movies between an Apple Macintosh computer and a Silicon Graphics computer by using a floppy disk or by using a network file transfer application.LBL="" HELPID=""Transferring Files from Floppy DiskIf you have an Indigo or an Indy with a floptical drive, you can read files from a floppy disk that was formatted on a Macintosh computer.LBL="" HELPID=""Transferring Files Over a NetworkTo transfer QuickTime movies between an Apple Macintosh computer and a Silicon Graphics computer over a network, use either ftp or the Apple Computer AppleShare network software. When using ftp, specify "binary" to ensure complete data transfer.LBL="" HELPID=""Adding QuickTime Capability to Your Movie Library ApplicationOnce you know how to program a Movie Library application, adding QuickTime capability is as easy as adding two lines to your code. Only three steps are needed to create an application that can use QuickTime movies (as long as they meet the compatibility criteria):including qt.h, the QuickTime header filecalling mvInitQuickTime() to initialize the Movie Library for QuickTime moviesThis step also installs the QuickTime codecs in the Movie Library if you have purchased the QuickTime Compressor Library.linking with the QuickTime Compressor Library by putting -lqt before -lmovie on the link lineQuickTime versions of many of the Movie Library sample programs are provided in the createmovieqt and miscqt directories under /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/dmedia/movie.LBL="" HELPID=""Using the QuickTime Compressor LibraryIf you have purchased and installed the Silicon Graphics QuickTime Compressor Library, codecs for Apple Video and Apple Animation are installed into the Movie Library and are available for your application to use on either QuickTime or Silicon Graphics movies.LBL="" HELPID=""Creating a QuickTime MovieYou can use the Movie Library to create a QuickTime movie that is playable on both Silicon Graphics and Apple computers. Use the same steps as creating a Silicon Graphics movie, but specify QuickTime format, as in the createmovieqt.c sample program.IDREF="19705" TYPE="TEXT"Example 31-1 highlights the changes that were made to the createmovie sample program to turn it into createmovieqt, which is an identical program that offers QuickTime compatibility.

Not valid for AF_AWARE_MULTIRATE.AF_AWARE_INDEPENDENT (default for MultiRate)indicates that the separate channels are unrelated and should be processed separately, such as multilingual sound tracks. AF_AWARE_PARAM_BITRATE_TARGETspecifies the desired bitrate for all channels of compressed data, in bits per second. Note that for some schemes such as MPEG's maxrate (not yet implemented) this is treated as an upper limit, whereas for MPEG's fixrate, this is strictly achieved as a constant rate. This parameter is not used for Aware's MultiRate algorithm.The following is a list of valid bitrates for MPEG:Layer 1: 32000, 64000, 96000, 128000, 160000, 192000, 224000, 256000, 288000, 320000, 352000, 384000, 416000, and 448000.Layer 2: 32000, 48000, 56000, 64000, 80000, 96000, 112000, 128000, 160000, 192000, 224000, 256000, 320000, and 384000.Default value is 192 Kbps/channel for layer 1 and 128 Kbps/channel for layer 2.AF_AWARE_PARAM_BITRATE_POLICYselects variants for interpreting AF_AWARE_PARAM_BITRATE_TARGET. The valid values depend on the compression type:Aware MPEG (AF_COMPRESSION_AWARE_MPEG) uses either:AF_AWARE_FIXED_RATE (default)fixed bitrate per second, where the compression ratio is set by AF_AWARE_PARAM_BITRATE_TARGET orAF_AWARE_CONST_QUALlets the bitrate be driven by the psychoacoustic model. Enough bits are assigned so that a constant noise-to-mask ratio is attained. See AF_AWARE_CONST_QUAL_NMR.Aware MultiRate (AF_COMPRESSION_AWARE_MULTIRATE) uses either:ID="MediaA-2B12"AF_AWARE_LOSSLESSsupplies enough bits to provide for perfect reconstruction. Compression ratios are typically between 2:1 and 3:1.orAF_AWARE_CONST_QUALenough bits are assigned so that the signal is 90+ dB above the quantization noise. Compression ratios are typically between 2.5:1 and 4:1.AF_AWARE_CONST_QUAL_NMRnot used in the Aware MultiRate algorithm. For AF_COMPRESSION_AWARE_MPEG with AF_AWARE_CONST_QUAL, it sets the constant quality mode noise-to-mask ratio in dB. Zero yields a theoretical psychoacoustically imperceptible compression. Positive values provide more compression and noise becomes audible. Negative values cause less compression and less perceptible noise. The type is AU_PVTYPE_DOUBLE.LBL="" HELPID=""Accessing Aware Audio Compression from the Compression LibraryThe Aware audio compression engines are already installed in the Silicon Graphics Compression Library uniform interface to video and audio compression routines. You can incorporate these routines into your applications and set up license querying to enable end users who choose to do so to license the routines. This section describes how to use the Compression Library interface to the Aware engines.ID="MediaA-2B13"LBL="" HELPID=""Compression SchemesAware currently provides two distinct compression schemes under the CL:CL_AWARE_MPEG_AUDIOISO/MPEG-audio standard algorithm with layers I and II.CL_AWARE_MULTIRATEAware MultiRate I proprietary lossless or low-distortion algorithm. ID="MediaA-2B14"ID="MediaA-2B15"Both scheme identifiers are defined in cl.h, as are all the identifiers in this section with the prefix CL_. Identifiers prefixed AWCMP_ are defined in awareAudio.h.LBL="" HELPID=""Using Compression Library ParametersThe CL is controlled by a wide range of parameters. Some parameters have multiple usesname='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'others are appropriate only in certain circumstances. This list explains the use of all the parameters of relevance to the Aware schemes:CL_ORIGINAL_FORMATindicates the format of the components of the original uncompressed audio. Default is CL_STEREO_INTERLEAVED, legal alternative is CL_MONO.CL_COMPONENTSindicates the number of channels in the original uncompressed audio. Only single and dual channel signals are currently supported.CL_BITS_PER_COMPONENTinforms the scheme of the format of the audio samples. They are assumed to be two's complement linear ints with the specified number of bits. The default is 16, which is also currently the only legal value.CL_FRAME_RATEtells the scheme the sampling rate of the uncompressed audio. Default is 44100.0 Hz. Legal values for scheme CL_AWARE_MPEG are 32000.0, 44100.0, and 48000.0. Legal values for scheme CL_AWARE_MULTIRATE are 8000.0, 11025.0, 16000.0, 22050.0, 32000.0, 44100.0, and 48000.0 Hz.ID="MediaA-2B16"CL_SPEED during decompression, this parameter controls the computational complexity by controlling several factors: sample rate decimation, combining of stereo channels, filter shape (CL_AWARE_MPEG only), and lossy decode (CL_AWARE_MULTIRATE only). Acceptable values range from 1.0 to 100.0. CL_SPEED has no effect during compression. NoteChanging this parameter may change the sampling rate, the total number of sample frames available, and the sample frames per compressed block. After changing this parameter, you must call clGetParams() to find out the new CL_FRAME_RATE and CL_BLOCK_SIZE.CL_CHANNEL_POLICYselects the treatment of stereo signals:AWCMP_STEREOstereo channels are coded separately.AWCMP_JOINT_STEREOstereo redundancy is exploited by coding high frequency sub-bands together.AWCMP_INDEPENDENTchannels are unrelated and are coded separately, such as multilingual sound tracks.NoteScheme CL_AWARE_MPEG_AUDIO supports all three modes; CL_AWARE_MULTIRATE supports only AWCMP_STEREO and AWCMP_INDEPENDENT.CL_BITRATE_POLICYProvides for different modes of bit assignment: ID="MediaA-2B17"AWCMP_FIXED_RATE  fixed bitrate for CL_AWARE_MPEG_AUDIO only. See CL_BITRATE_TARGET. This is the default for CL_AWARE_MPEG_AUDIO. AWCMP_CONST_QUAL  bitrate is allowed to vary to satisfy MPEG psychoacoustic model or MultiRate data requirements (90+ dB). This is the default for CL_AWARE_MULTIRATE. See CL_NOISE_MARGIN. AWCMP_LOSSLESS  valid for CL_AWARE_MULTIRATE only. Data is coded losslessly.CL_NOISE_MARGINused in conjunction with CL_BITRATE_POLICY's AWCMP_CONST_QUAL. Provides for specification of the noise-to-mask ratio in MPEG psychoacoustics. Zero yields a theoretical psychoacoustically imperceptible compression. Positive values provide more compression and noise becomes audible. Negative values cause less compression and less perceptible noise. For the ID="MediaA-2B18"MultiRate algorithm, this parameter sets the noise-floor at -90 dB below the signal level. This is the only valid MultiRate setting at this time.CL_LAYER(MPEG only) selects the MPEG layer. Default is AWCMP_MPEG_LAYER_II for layer II, other legal value is AWCMP_MPEG_LAYER_I for layer I.CL_BITRATE_MODEprovides for different modes of operation such as fixed rate or constant quality; however, the only legal values at present are AWCMP_FIXED_RATE for MPEG and AWCMP_CONST_QUAL or AWCMP_LOSSLESS for MultiRate.CL_BITRATE_TARGETused in conjunction with CL_BITRATE_POLICY's AWCMP_FIXED_RATE (MPEG). Determines the output data rate in bits per second. The allowed values are:MPEG layer I: 32000, 64000, 96000, 128000, 160000, 192000, 224000256000, 288000, 320000, 352000, 384000, 416000, 448000.MPEG layer II: 32000, 48000, 56000, 64000, 80000, 96000, 112000,128000, 160000, 192000, 224000, 256000, 320000, 384000.CL_COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZEWhen a scheme is configured, this field can be queried to find the maximum compressed size of a block of CL_BLOCK_SIZE samples. This is useful for allocating buffers to hold this compressed data. If the application sets this parameter (to inform the CL of the size of an externally allocated buffer), the compression code does not change that value, even if its configuration is modified.The following parameters are read-only:CL_BLOCK_SIZEThe scheme writes the number of uncompressed sample frames to compress at a time by the scheme. It is strongly advised that data be passed to clCompress() in blocks that are exact multiples of this size; otherwise, the algorithm will defer to compression of partial frames, which may cause unexpected problems. CL_COMPRESSION_RATIOThe scheme writes a compression ratio into this parameter. Parameter CL_EXACT_COMPRESSION_RATIO will be true if this is an exact compression ratio and false if it is a worst-case estimate.CL_EXACT_COMPRESSION_RATIOIndicates whether the compression ration in CL_EXACT_COMPRESSION_RATIO is exact (TRUE), or a worst-case estimate (FALSE). This parameter is always true for pure MPEG, because it is a fixed-bitrate scheme, and false otherwise; therefore, this parameter is currently of interest only for the MPEG scheme.CL_FRAME_TYPEindicates the status of the next frame to be processed: CL_KEYFRAME, meaning that the frame is the first frame in a compressed block, which is what it should be if all calls are in BLOCK_SIZE blocks.CL_PREDICTED is the frame type for all other alignments.LBL="" HELPID=""Usage HintsYou'll get the best compression results if you keep these hints in mind:Always compress blocks of CL_BLOCKSIZE sample frames.The first block that comes out of an instance of a compression scheme has extra configuration information attached in front of it. On decompression, this should be fetched first (you will have to query its maximum size), then fed to clReadHeader(). Thereafter, the CL_COMPRESSED_BUFFER_SIZE can be read and used to allocate a proper data buffer, if so desired.No provision has been made for alignment of delay as a result of filter latency through the Compression Library (which can be a few hundred samples depending on scheme), or for zero-padding the final frame to ensure that the filter is flushed. These must be handled by the application, if required.LBL="" HELPID=""Aware Audio Compression Software SpecificationsThis section lists the specifications for the Aware audio compression software.ID="MediaA-2B19"Compression AlgorithmsISO/MPEG Layer I and II low bitrate psychoacoustic compressionAware MultiRate I high resolution audio compressionLibrary SupportSilicon Graphics Audio File Library (AF)Silicon Graphics Compression Library (CL)Encoder InputFormat: 16-bit linear audio samples, mono or stereoSample Rates:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="95"MPEG EncoderLEFT="100" WIDTH="147"48, 44.1, 32 kHzLEFT="0" WIDTH="95"MultiRate EncoderLEFT="100" WIDTH="147"48, 44.1, 32, 22.05, 16, 11.025 kHzID="MediaA-2B20"Decoder OutputFormat:16 bit linear audio samples, mono or stereoSample Rates: 48, 44.1, 32, 24, 22.05, 16, 11.025 (MPEG, MultiRate Decoders)Compression Ratios:2:1 to 3:1typical MultiRate lossless (perfectly invertible) mode2.5:1 to 4:1typical MultiRate near-lossless (90+ dB signal to noise) mode2.2:1 to 48:1 selectable, MPEG Layer I and IIBitrates (Kbits/sec):MPEG Layer I32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 288, 320, 352, 384, 416, 448MPEG Layer II32, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384 Channel ProcessingCOLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="104"MPEG Layer I and IILEFT="110" WIDTH="175"mono, stereo, joint stereo, dual channelLEFT="0" WIDTH="104"MultiRateLEFT="110" WIDTH="175"mono, stereoScalable ProcessingControlled reduction of CPU usage by parametric control of frequency response, signal to noise ratio, and mono decoding of stereo.IDREF="29989" TYPE="TABLE"Table B-1 lists the compression algorithms that are built in to each Aware software compression engine product.COLUMNS="2"LBL="B-1"Table B-1 ID="29989"Built-in Algorithms for Aware Audio Software Compression EnginesLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"ProductLEFT="150" WIDTH="189"Compression Algorithms InstalledLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"AudioPublisherLEFT="150" WIDTH="189"ISO/MPEG Layer I and II EncoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"LEFT="150" WIDTH="189"Aware MultiRate I EncoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"LEFT="150" WIDTH="189"ISO/MPEG Layer I and II DecoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"LEFT="150" WIDTH="189"Aware MultiRate DecoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"AudioProducerLEFT="150" WIDTH="189"Aware MultiRate I EncoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"LEFT="150" WIDTH="189"ISO/MPEG Layer I and II DecoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"LEFT="150" WIDTH="189"Aware MultiRate DecoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"AudioPlaybackLEFT="150" WIDTH="189" ISO/MPEG Layer I and II DecoderLEFT="0" WIDTH="144"LEFT="150" WIDTH="189"Aware MultiRate DecoderLBL="" HELPID=""ID="83855"Installing a NetLS Nodelocked LicenseA product that is licensed with NetLS can use either a nodelocked license or a concurrent access license. On the ID="MediaA-2B21"Silicon Graphics Vendor and License Information sheet, in the licensetype field, it lists either "Concurrent Access" or "NodeLocked" specifying the type of license you have been issued.This section documents nodelocked licenses. With a nodelocked license, the product can be run only on the machine that has the nodelocked license installed. To enable a nodelocked license, the "vendor ID" and "product password" from the ID="MediaA-2B22"Silicon Graphics Vendor and License Information sheet are entered into the file /usr/netls/nodelock. After that, a product should have permission to run on the machine with the ID="MediaA-2B23"nodelock file.To install a nodelocked license:Verify that the product you want to license is already installed, by entering:ID="MediaA-2B24"% /usr/sbin/versionsFor IRIX release 5.0 or earlier, netls_eoe and nck subsystems do not need to be installed. For IRIX release 5.0.1 or later, it is recommended that netls_eoe be installed, in order to create the link from /usr/netls/nodelock to /var/netls/nodelock. This link is needed by some NetLS licensed products that are not Silicon Graphics products. The llb, glb, and netls flags, which you can set with the /etc/chkconfig command, do not affect whether a nodelocked license will work, but it is a good idea to set these flags correctly anyway. If this machine is not being used as a NetLS or glb database server, chkconfig these flags off. To change the flags, enter this sequence of commands:# su

The standard, which is also referred to as 4:2:2, sets parameters for both 525-line and 625-line systems.chromaSee chrominance.chroma keyingOverlaying one video source on another by choosing a key color. For example, if chroma keying is on blue, video source A might show through video source B everywhere the color blue appears in video source B. A common example is the TV weather reporter standing in front of the satellite weather map. The weather reporter, wearing any color but blue, stands in front of a blue background; keying on blue shows the satellite picture everywhere blue appears. Because there is no blue on the weatherperson, he or she appears to be standing in front of the weather map.chroma signalA 3.58MHz (NTSC) or 4.43MHz (PAL) subcarrier signal for color in television. SECAM uses two frequency-modulated color subcarriers transmitted on alternate horizontal lines; SCR is 4.406MHz and SCB is 4.250MHz.chrominance In an image reproduction system, a separate signal that contains the color information. Black, white, and all shades of gray have no chrominance and contain only the luminance (brightness) portion of the signal.

The RGB signals change in relation to the individual colors in the test pattern. When a secondary color is generated, a combination of the RGB signals occurs. Since only the primary and secondary colors are being displayed at 100% saturation, the R, G, and B waveforms are simply on or off. For more complex patterns of color, the individual R, G, and B signals would be varying amplitudes in the percentages needed to express that particular color.

The chief composite television standard signals are NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. See also NTSC, PAL, and SECAM.cross-chrominance, cross-luminanceAlso known as cross-color, hanging dots, dot crawl; moving colors on stationary objects. This undesirable artifact is caused by high bandwidth luminance information being misinterpreted as color information. Hanging dots are a byproduct of the comb filters (used to help separate the color and brightness information) found in most modern television receivers. This artifact can be reduced or eliminated by using S-Video or a component video format.cross-fadeA type of transition in which one video clip is faded down while another is faded up.D1Digital recording technique for component video; also known as CCIR 601, 4:2:2.

See also CCIR 601.D2Digital recording technique for composite video. As with analog composite, the luminance and chrominance information is sent as one signal. A D2 VTR offers higher resolution and can make multiple generation copies without noticeable quality loss, because it samples an analog composite video signal at four times the subcarrier (using linear quantization), representing the samples as 8-bit digital words. D2 is not compatible with D1.D3, DXDeveloped by Panasonic, a 1/2-inch tape version of D2. More often called DX.decoderHardware or software that converts, or decodes, a composite video signal into the various components of the signal.

Filter functions include blur (low-pass) and crisp (high-pass).flickerThe effect caused by a one-pixel-deep line in a high-resolution graphics frame that is output to a low-resolution monitor, because the line is in only one of the alternating fields that make up the frame. This effect can be filtered out by field averaging. See also field and frame.frameThe result of a complete scanning of one image. In television, the odd field (all the odd lines of the frame) and the even field (all the even lines of the frame) make up the frame.

Usually formed by combining B-Y and R-Y video signals.gamma correctionCorrection of gray-scale inconsistency. The brightness characteristic of a CRT is not linear with respect to voltage; the voltage-to-intensity characteristic is usually close to a power of 2.2. If left uncorrected, the resulting display has too much contrast and detail in black regions is not reproduced.To correct this inconsistency, a correction factor using the 2.2 root of the input signal is included, so that equal steps of brightness or intensity at the input are reproduced with equal steps of intensity at the display. genlockingSynchronizing with another video signal serving as a master timing source. The master timing source can be a composite video signal, a video signal with no active video (only sync information), or, for video studio, a device called house sync. When there is no master sync available, VideoFramer, for example, can be set to "free run" (or "stand-alone") mode, so that it becomes the master timing device to which other devices sync.

Blanking level is 0 IRE units and peak white level is 100 IRE units (700mv). An IRE unit equals 7.14mv (+100 IRE to -40 IRE = 1v). IRE stands for Institute of Radio Engineers, a forerunner of the IEEE. keyingCombining proportional amounts of two frames, pixel by pixel, with optional opacity. This process resembles taking two panes of glass with images on them and placing one pane on top of the other. The opacity of the top pane determines the parts of the bottom pane that show. Usually, keying is a real-time continuous process, as in the "over the shoulder" graphics in TV news programs. The alpha component of each pixel, which defines its opacity, determines how the images are combined. Combining images based on the alpha component is often called alpha keying or luma keying.

A black level that is elevated to 7.5 IRE instead of being left at 0.0 IRE, the same as the lowest level for active video. Because the video level is known, this part of the signal is used for black-level clamping circuit operation. Setup is typically used in the NTSC video format and is typically not used in the PAL video format; it was originally introduced to simplify the design of early television receivers, which had trouble distinguishing between video black levels and horizontal blanking.

See also video waveform.Y signalLuminance, corresponding to the brightness of an image. See also luminance and Y/R-Y/B-Y.YC A color space (color component encoding format) based on YIQ or YUV. Y is luminance, but the two chroma signals (I and Q or U and V) are combined into a composite chroma called C, resulting in a two-wire signal. C is derived from I and Q as follows: C - I cos(2\xb9 fsct) + Q sin(2\xb9 fsct)where fsc is the subcarrier frequency. YC-358 is the NTSC version of this luminance/chrominance format; YC-443 is the PAL version. Both are referred to as S-Video formats.YIQA color space (color component encoding format) used in decoding, in which Y is the luminance signal and I and Q are the chrominance signals. The two chrominance signals I and Q (in-phase and quadrature, respectively) are two-phase amplitude-modulated; the I component modulates the subcarrier at an angle of 0 degrees and the Q component modulates it at 90 degrees. The color burst is at 33 degrees relative to the Q signal.The amplitude of the color subcarrier represents the saturation values of the image; the phase of the color subcarrier represents the hue value of the image.Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114BI = 0.596R - 0.275G - 0.321BQ = 0.212R - 0.523G + 0.311BY/R-Y/B-YA name for the YUV color component encoding format that summarizes how the chrominance components are derived. Y is the luminance signal and R-Y and B-Y are the chrominance signals. R-Y (red minus Y) and B-Y (blue minus Y) are the color differences or chrominance components. The color difference signals R-Y and B-Y are derived as follows:Y = 0.299R + 0.587 + 0.114BY/R-Y/B-Y has many variations, just as NTSC and PAL do. All component and composite color encoding formats are derived from RGB without scan standards being changed. The matrix (amount of red, green, and blue) values and scale (amplitude) factors can differ from one component format to another (YUV, Y/R-Y, B-Y, SMPTE Y/R-Y, B-Y).YUVA color space (color component encoding format) used by the PAL video standard, in which Y is the luminance signal and U and V are the chrominance signals. The two chrominance signals U and V are two-phase amplitude-modulated. The U component modulates the subcarrier at an angle of 0 degree, but the V component modulates it at 90 degrees or 180 degrees on alternate lines. The color burst is also line-alternated at +135 and -135 degrees relative to the U signal. The YUV matrix multiplier derives colors from RGB via the following formula:Y = .299R + .587 G + .114 BCR = R - YCB = B - YIn this formula, Y represents luminance; red and blue are derived from it: CR denotes red and (V), CB denotes blue. V corresponds to CR; U corresponds to CB c. The U and V signals are carried on the same bandwidth. This system is sometimes referred to as Y/R-Y/B-Y. The name for this color encoding method is YUV, despite the fact that the order of the signals according to the formula is YVU.4-channel audiocablingIDREF="Media2-2HW18"4-channel Audio I/O
