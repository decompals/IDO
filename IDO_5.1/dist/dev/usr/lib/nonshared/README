Non-Shared Libraries for SPEC Benchmarks

Essentially all executables in this release are constructed using the
Dynamic Shared Objects (DSO) facilities described elsewhere.  Using
DSO is required for compliance with the SVR4 ABI.  There is a very
small performance penalty associated with DSO.  For essentially all
applications, the benefits of DSO for application portability far
outweigh the costs of this performance penalty.  However in the
case of the widely used SPEC Benchmark suite, SGI has chosen to
report performance figures based on statically linked libraries. SPEC requires
that any reported benchmarks be reproducible by customers, and that
all components used to generate the reported numbers be available
to customers.  To meet this requirement, we have included the non-shared
libraries used in generating the SPEC benchmark report as the optional
package dev.sw.speclibs.  The use of these libraries for production
software is strongly discouraged, as doing so forfeits the benefits of
application portability and ease of maintenance afforded by DSO. These
libraries also may be deleted in future releases of IRIX and executables
linked with these libraries may not execute successfully on future releases
of IRIX. The libraries provided are only those required by the SPEC
benchmarks and do not include a non-shared version of every system library.
The SPEC performance report provides details on how to repeat our benchmark
generation using these libraries.
