All platforms will be migrating to the Indigo Magic User Environment. This manual tells you how to integrate your application into the Indigo Magic User Environment, which includes the Indigo Magic Desktop. To learn how to integrate your application into WorkSpace, please see the IRIS WorkSpace Integration Guide.† †This book is written for programmers who want to learn how to integrate applications into the Indigo Magic‘ Desktop. It describes how to program the appearance and functionality of file icons in the Desktop environment. Specifically, it explains how to customize existing icons, how to create unique icons for your application, and how to dictate the way your icons behave in the Desktop.ID="intro1"This book assumes that you are already familiar with the basic appearance and functionality of the Desktop. To learn how to use the Indigo Magic Desktop, refer to the† †IRIS Essentials. This book also assumes that you are familiar with the IRIX‘ operating system and know how to write shell scripts.

The first section lists the steps you must complete to create a working icon. The second and third sections explain these steps in more detail. The fourth section explains how to create customizations for a specific user on a single workstation.This chapter contains these sections:IDREF="56002" TYPE="TITLE""About the Indigo Magic Desktop"IDREF="91887" TYPE="TITLE""Creating an Icon: the Basic Steps"IDREF="36712" TYPE="TITLE""Some Definitions"IDREF="15532" TYPE="TITLE""How to Draw an Icon"IDREF="48786" TYPE="TITLE""How to Program an Icon"IDREF="87490" TYPE="TITLE""What to Name FTR Files"IDREF="24688" TYPE="TITLE""Where to Put FTR Files"IDREF="35640" TYPE="TITLE""Where to Put Icon Files"IDREF="11067" TYPE="TITLE""How to Compile the Source Files"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="56002"About the Indigo Magic DesktopThe Indigo Magic Desktop adds a sophisticated graphical user interface to the IRIX file system and operating system. Icons in the Desktop represent files and directories. You can execute shell commands and run programs by manipulating Desktop icons using the Desktop's point-and-click interface.ID="chap.011"ID="chap.012"Most people who use IRIS workstations also use the Desktop. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your application is easy to access and manipulate from within the Desktop. The Desktop provides tools that make it relatively easy for you to design your own icons, and to tailor icon behavior to fit the needs of each application.For utilities and files that do not require a personalized look, you can use a predefined file type instead of drawing and programming your own unique icon.ID="chap.013"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="91887"Creating an Icon: the Basic StepsHere is a brief outline of the steps to follow to create an icon and to program its desired behavior within the Desktop. The rest of this chapter explains each step in more detail. The exception is step one, which is explained in IDREF="17843" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2, "Using IconSmith."
"ID="chap.014"Draw a picture of your icon. Draw it using the† †IconSmith application. Once you've created a drawing that pleases you, save it in a file with the suffix .fti. For example, if your application is called ExcellentDudes, you might name the icon file, ExcellentDudesIcon.fti. For information on how to use IconSmith, see IDREF="48028" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 1
.Program your icon. Icon behavior is dictated by a set of rules called file typing rules (FTRs). These are described in IDREF="37453" TYPE="TITLE""File Typing Rules"
 To program your icon, include a selection of these rules in a file called an FTR file. You can program more than one icon in a single FTR file. To learn how to program your icon, see IDREF="16150" TYPE="TITLE""How to Create a File Type"
.Put the FTR file in the appropriate directory. To determine where your FTR file belongs, see IDREF="87490" TYPE="TITLE""What to Name FTR Files"
. Put your icon file in the correct directory. The icon file (.fti file) that you create in Step 1 belongs in one of two different directories. To decide the directory location of your icon file, see IDREF="35640" TYPE="TITLE""Where to Put Icon Files"
.Compile the appropriate source files. Compile the workspace.ctrworkspace.ctr file, which contains the compiled source for all existing FTRs. For more information on the† †workspace.ctr file, see IDREF="11067" TYPE="TITLE""How to Compile the Source Files"
.Restart the Desktop. You can view your changes after you restart the Desktop.Update your installation script. If you want to install your application on other Silicon Graphics, Inc.Æ workstations, include in your installation script all of the files that you created in the preceding steps. IDREF="53113" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 4, "How to Create and Program an Icon: an Example,"contains a step-by-step example of how to program a Desktop icon. If you do not want to read the whole book, just read the rest of this chapter to learn the basics; then use the basic steps listed here and the example in IDREF="53113" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 4
 to figure out how to program your icon. Refer to the sections indicated when you require more detailed information.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="36712"Some DefinitionsThis section explains the basic terms you need to understand the rest of this book. LBL="" HELPID=""File TypesA ID="chap.015"file type is a named collection of rules, including a rule for incorporating the icon picture and some rules governing icon behavior. The Desktop examines files to determine their type, then displays the appropriate icon for that type. There are hundreds of file types already defined in the Desktop, including types for text files, generic executables, Showcase, Showcase data files, and many more. You can define your own file types to make your application and its associated files perform as you wish within the Desktop.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="37453"File Typing RulesFile types are defined by a set of rules called† †file typing rulesID="chap.016" (FTRs). File typing rules determine how files look and act within the Desktop. The Desktop uses FTRs to evaluate all files that are presented within the Desktop or any Directory View window. The syntax of these rules is discussed in IDREF="36003" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 3, "File Typing Rules."An additional set of rules defines the preferred method of sending a file of a particular type to a printer. These rules are called print conversion rules, and are discussed in IDREF="55672" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5, "Printing From the Desktop."LBL="" HELPID=""FTR FilesThe Desktop reads FTRs from compiled versions of special text files called ID="chap.017"FTR files. An FTR file is a file in which one or more file types are defined. You can define multiple types in a single file.   An FTR source file ends with the suffix .ftr, and must reside in one specific directory. See IDREF="87490" TYPE="TITLE""What to Name FTR Files"
.LBL="" HELPID=""How to ID="15532"Draw an IconSince many end users work almost exclusively in the Desktop, it's important that your application has a unique, attractive Desktop icon. In addition to making your application look more appealing, a unique icon helps users distinguish your application from among the many icons in the Desktop. To create an icon, draw a picture of the icon using the IconSmith draw tool described in IDREF="17843" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 2. Then save the picture in the correct format and put the saved file in the correct directory. To determine the correct directory in which to put the icon file, see IDREF="24688" TYPE="TITLE""Where to Put FTR Files"
.For hints on designing icons, see the Silicon Graphics User Interface Guidelines.LBL="" HELPID=""How to ID="48786"Program an IconThere are many different kinds of files within the IRIX file system including plain text files, formatted documents, directories, shell scripts, images and binary executables. Each of these groups of files is represented in the Desktop by its own unique icon. Users expect different behaviors from different types of icons. For example, when you double-click on an icon representing an executable, you run the executable. Alternatively, when you double-click on an icon representing an image, the image appears on your screen.Before programming your icon, give some thought to how people want to use the file it represents: ID="chap.018"Decide how you want the file to appear when users double-click on the icon, how you want it to act within the Desktop, and what combination of options serves as the default setting. The remaining sections in this chapter explain how to program icon behavior using the rules listed in IDREF="36003" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 3
.† †If there are several important combinations of options, incorporate them into an icon menu. You do this using the MENU rule discussed in IDREF="31739" TYPE="TITLE""Adding Menu Items"
. Decide how the Desktop should print your files when users select the "Print" option from the Desktop menu. IDREF="55672" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 5
 explains how to set print configurations.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="16150"How to Create a File TypeTo create a file type, open a new file (or an existing FTR file) using the text editor of your choice. Then type in the FTRs you need to program the icon to behave as you want. Start on the first line with the TYPE rule, which is the rule you use to name the file type. The FTRs are listed and described in detail in ID="chap.019"IDREF="36003" TYPE="TITLE"Chapter 3
. You can define all the necessary file types for your application in a single FTR file.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="87490"What to Name FTR FilesThe standard naming convention for application vendors' FTR files is:ID="chap.0110"ID="chap.0111"vendor-name[.application-name].ftrwhere vendor-name is the name of your company and application-name is the name of your application.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="24688"Where to Put FTR FilesIt is important to place your FTR file in the appropriate directory.Most FTR files that are not created at Silicon Graphics belong in the /usr/lib/filetype/install directory. There are also specific FTR directories set aside for site administration, and user customizations. For a list of all FTR directories, see IDREF="51651" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix C, "FTR File Directories."LBL="" HELPID=""ID="35640"Where to Put Icon Files† †ID="42708"If you put your .ftr files in the† †/usr/lib/filetype/install directory, then put your .fti files in the /usr/lib/filetype/install/iconlib directory. If you put your† †.ftr files ein one of the other directories listed in IDREF="51651" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix C
, then put your .fti file in a subdirectory of that directory. Name the subdirectory iconlib. LBL="" HELPID=""How to ID="11067"Compile the Source FilesThe Desktopcompiles FTR source files into files calledID="chap.0112"ID="chap.0113"ID="chap.0114"ID="chap.0115"ID="chap.0116"† †workspace.ctr files. Any time you add or change FTRs (or print conversion rules) you must recompile the appropriate workspace.ctr file. To compile the workspace.ctr file in the /usr/lib/filetype directory, follow these steps:cd /usr/lib/filetype† †su make To activate the new FTRs, quit and restart the Desktop.When distributing and installing your application and its FTR files on a new machine, be sure that your installation process copies the FTR files into /usr/lib/filetype/install and then remakes the FTR file set using the procedure described above.LBL="2"ID="17843"Using IconSmithThis chapter contains these sections:IDREF="38832" TYPE="TITLE""About IconSmith"IDREF="63643" TYPE="TITLE""Using this Chapter"IDREF="87252" TYPE="TITLE""Starting IconSmith"IDREF="65037" TYPE="TITLE""IconSmith Menus"IDREF="15755" TYPE="TITLE""IconSmith Windows"IDREF="49874" TYPE="TITLE""Drawing with IconSmith"IDREF="26999" TYPE="TITLE""Selecting"IDREF="93773" TYPE="TITLE""Transformations"IDREF="47763" TYPE="TITLE""Concave Polygons"IDREF="34047" TYPE="TITLE""Constraints: Gravity (Object) Snap and Grid Snap"IDREF="18262" TYPE="TITLE""Icon Composition Conventions".IDREF="15796" TYPE="TITLE""Advanced IconSmith Techniques"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="38832"About IconSmithIconSmith is a drawing program for creating Desktop icons. Use it to create color icons to represent any file or directory on the system. Icons drawn with IconSmith are saved in the icon description language and can be included with file type rules or kept in a separate file. The icon description language is described in ID="chap.021"ID="chap.022"IDREF="25750" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix B, "The Icon Description Language."Designed for the specific requirements of the Desktop, Iconsmith produces icons that draw quickly and display properly in the Desktop on all IRIS-4D Series workstations. To that end, limitations have been imposed on the color palette and geometry. Iconsmith is not a general-use drawing application. Use it only to draw Desktop icons.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="63643"Using this ChapterThis chapter explains how to create Desktop icons using IconSmith. Use this chapter while designing and drawing your icon. The features of IconSmith are described first, followed by examples. Features are organized by topic, rather than by window or menu. The examples use IconSmith features and explain tricks or shortcuts. LBL="" HELPID=""TerminologyIconSmith uses some terms that may not be familiar to you. This section defines some terms used in the rest of this chapter. ID="chap.023"LBL="" HELPID=""CaretID="chap.024"The caret is a small red and blue cross.

LBL="" HELPID=""Transformation PinID="chap.025"The Transformation Pin indicates the point from which an object is scaled or sheared and around which an object is rotated. It is a blue and white cross, larger than the caret. It can be dropped anywhere to affect a transform.LBL="" HELPID=""VertexID="chap.026"A vertex is a selectable point, created when the mouse is clicked in the IconSmith window while the <Ctrl> key is held down.LBL="" HELPID=""PathID="chap.027"A path is one or more line segments between vertices. Paths can be open or closed, filled or unfilled. For example, a side of a triangle, between two corners.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="87252"Starting IconSmithID="chap.028"To start IconSmith from the Desktop, double-click on the IconSmith icon, shown in IDREF="13541" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-1

When drawing in IconSmith, it is easy to select the wrong object. Complex icons can make for a complex selection process. Draw adjacent icon components separately to confusion when selecting and editing an object. When you have finished the parts, you can move them together.There is an "Undo" option in the IconSmith pop-up menu. To bring up the IconSmith pop-up menu, hold down the right mouse button. You can undo up to 9 operations using the <F1> key. To redo something you have undone, hold the <Shift> key and press the <F1> key.No single polygon can contain more than 255 vertices. ID="chap.0211"LBL="" HELPID=""Drawing PathsID="chap.0212"To draw a path with IconSmith: Select a starting point by clicking the left mouse button.Move the mouse to a new position.Hold down the <Control> key and click the left mouse button.This process creates a line segment. To add more line segments connected to the first, repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as necessary. To create a disconnected line segment, repeat from step 1.LBL="" HELPID=""Drawing Filled ShapesID="chap.0213"In IconSmith, a closed path (one in which the beginning and end points meet) can be filled with a color. To draw a filled shape, make sure that you have selected a fill color from the Palette menu, and proceed to draw. When you finish creating the closed path, the shape is filled with the current fill color.Fill does not work properly with concave closed paths, nor with paths in which the beginning point does not meet the end point. See IDREF="47763" TYPE="TITLE""Concave Polygons".LBL="" HELPID=""DeletingID="chap.0214"To delete any path or vertex, select it and press the <Back Space> key, or use "Delete" in the IconSmith pop-up menu.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="12126"Keeping the 3-D LookID="chap.0215"Icons created by Silicon Graphics are drawn in the same isometric view, which provides an illusion of 3-D, even though the polygons composing the icons are 2-D. If you draw icons facing the screen at right angles, they look 2-D.To generate a 3-D effect, draw "horizontal" lines so that they move up 1 unit in the y-axis for every 2 units they extend along the true x-axis. See IDREF="36378" TYPE="GRAPHIC"Figure 2-6
.LBL="2-6" FILE="figure2.6.bw" POSITION="INLINE" SCALE="FALSE"LBL="2-6"Figure 2-6 ID="36378"3-D Icon AxesUse the same projection that the original icon set uses. Icons tilted in the wrong direction look off-balance, and destroy the 3-D appearance. For your convenience, IconSmith provides an isometric grid. By following the diagonals of this grid, as shown, you can create an icon that fits in exactly with other isometric icons in the Desktop. You can count along these diagonal grid dots, to help measure, align, or center pieces of your icon.LBL="" HELPID=""Drawing For All scalesID="chap.0216"Desktop icons can be displayed in many sizes. It is easier to draw an icon that looks good small, but you might consider the details that appears when a user enlarges your icon.IconSmith includes two features useful in designing your icon for display at all sizes, the Preview box and the slider on the right side of the drawing area. LBL="" HELPID=""The Preview BoxID="chap.0217"ID="chap.0218"You can use the Preview box to see your icon design in common sizes and background colors. The Preview box is the blue box in the lower left corner of the main IconSmith window. By default, the Preview box shows your drawing at the default Desktop icon display size and no background color. You can change the icon size and background color in this window using the Preview box pop-up menu. LBL="" HELPID=""Changing Drawing SizeID="chap.0219"You can change the size of your design in the IconSmith drawing area using the slider on the right side of the drawing area. Use the slider to look at your design at all sizes. At particularly small sizes, some features may not be visible. At large sizes, design imperfections may appear.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="32183"Sharing Design ElementsID="chap.0220"ID="chap.0221"ID="chap.0222"You can import design elements such as circles into your icon. Importing elements where possible saves you work and makes it easy to include common design elements in all the icons for one application.To import any file in icon format, click on the Import button. This brings up the Import Icon or Set Template window. Use the "Import to Icon Editing Layer" area to specify the icon file you want.Generic and sample material can be found in theID="chap.0223"ID="chap.0224"† †/usr/lib/filetype/iconlib directory. For example, to import a sample circle, type in the file name:/usr/lib/filetype/iconlib/sample.circle.ftiOther icons can be found in:/usr/lib/filetype/default/iconlib
/usr/lib/filetype/system/iconlib
/usr/lib/filetype/vadmin/iconlibAll icons are potential sources for design elements. However, if you are designing a unique set of executable or document icons, you should make use of templates as described in IDREF="27192" TYPE="TITLE""Templates"
 and IDREF="18262" TYPE="TITLE""Icon Composition Conventions".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="27192"TemplatesID="chap.0225"You can use templates for tracing or to help you design your icons. You can import a template so that you can see it in the IconSmith drawing window, without saving or displaying as part of the design. This is most useful for getting position information while you are designing a unique badge to use in conjunction with the generic executable and document icons.You cannot move or change an icon template in IconSmith.To display a template, click on the Import button. In the Import Icon or Set Template window, type the name of the template icon file you want in the area labeled "Set Template Layer." Note that three template images are available from buttons in this window. These template images are the most often used, and they are discussed in ID="chap.0226"IDREF="18262" TYPE="TITLE""Icon Composition Conventions"
.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="26999"SelectingID="chap.0227"Before you edit, move, delete, or change the color of an object or vertex, you have to tell IconSmith which object you want. This can be difficult in a complex composition. Here are some tips that can make the task easier:ID="chap.0228"To select an object or vertex, move the cursor on top of the object and click the left mouse button. The vertices highlight blue and white when the object is selected. To move the vertex or object, double-click, hold down the left mouse button and move with the mouse. The vertices highlight green and yellow when you can move the object.You can select more than one object or vertex by holding down the <Shift> key during the selection process. To move the objects or vertices, move only one and the rest will follow.You can select all vertices in an area with your mouse. Hold down the left mouse button and sweep the cursor across the vertices you want. The area you select is indicated by a box. When you let go of the left mouse button, all vertices are selected.You can deselect a vertex by holding down the <Shift> key and clicking on the vertex.LBL="" HELPID=""PartialID="chap.0229"When you use the mouse to select an area with objects in it, you might include only some vertices of some objects. When you click Partial on, objects partially selected are highlighted. When you click Partial off, partially selected objects are ignored. LBL="" HELPID=""Deselect Part PathsID="chap.0230"In compositions with many objects, you can use "ID="chap.0231"Deselect Part Paths" to make selection easier. When selecting the objects in the drawing area, you can also select adjacent objects, then deselect what you don't want. Hold the† †<Shift> key down and click on one vertex of each object you don't want. This deselects the vertex, which makes the object partially selected. Then you can use "Deselect Part Paths" from the IconSmith pop-up menu to deselect the entire object.LBL="" HELPID=""Select NextID="chap.0232""Select Next" allows you to select a vertex that is covered by another vertex. When two or more trajectories each have a vertex at a common location, such as two triangles with a coincident edge, the "Select Next" operator is useful for selecting a trajectory other than the top one. "Select Next" is also useful in images with tiled parts, where most vertices share a location. Select a shared vertex by clicking on its location. That vertex is highlighted in yellow and green (and the red and blue caret appears at that spot). The other vertices of the trajectory selected are highlighted in white to indicate the trajectory to which the selected vertex belongs. Now each time you choose "ID="chap.0233"Select Next" from the IconSmith menu, you step through all the other vertices of all the other trajectories which have a vertex at that point.LBL="" HELPID=""Select AllID="chap.0234"You can select all vertices in the main IconSmith window drawing area using the "Select All" option in the IconSmith pop-up menu. You can select all vertices in an area by holding down the left mouse button and sweeping out a box to surround the desired area.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="93773"TransformationsID="chap.0235"ID="chap.0236"The Transform buttons let you shrink, enlarge, stretch, and rotate portions of your icon design. These features can make drawing easier and more precise. To use any Transform button, follow this procedure.Choose the Transform option you want.Choose a point in the main IconSmith window drawing area as a reference point for the transformation by positioning the cursor and clicking the left mouse button.Bring up the IconSmith pop-up menu and select "Push Pin" from the Transform Pin rollover menu. To select an entire object for transformation, hold down the <Alt> key and double-click on the object you want to transform. Otherwise, you may select individual vertices by holding down the <Alt> and <Shift> keys while clicking on each desired vertex. Do not release the <Alt> key when you have finished selecting vertices.While still holding down the <Alt> key, position the cursor inside the object you want to transform. Press and hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to transform the object.For example, here is how you enlarge a circle.ID="chap.0237"Choose "ScaleID="chap.0238"" from the Transform menu. Choose a point on the perimeter of the circle.Bring up the IconSmith pop-up menu and select "Move to Caret" from the "Transform Pin" rollover menu.Hold down the <Alt> key and double-click on the circle.

This makes drawing easier and more precise. Grid snap causes the caret to "snap" to vertices and/or edges of the grid pattern displayed behind the objects you are editing. Gravity snap causes the caret to snap to vertices and edges of objects you have already drawn. It is a good idea to make use of these features to ensure that your icon looks clean and precise at all sizes.Gravity snap and grid snap features are controlled by the Constraints window.

The Show button lets you display or hide the grid.The following setting choices are available for the grid in the Constraints window:Grid Basis buttons control the shape of the grids. IconSmith includes two types of grids. The isometric grid provides guidance in the perspective described in IDREF="12126" TYPE="TITLE""Keeping the 3-D Look".
 IconSmith also provides a traditional square grid. To change the type of grid you are using, select a Grid Basis button, and then press Apply.Snap to Grid buttons change the grid into lines or lines and vertices. These changes are reflected in the appearance of the grid after you select Apply.Grid Spacing controls the distance between points in the grid. You can type in the number of pixels you want, or base the distance on a selected line in your icon design. When you copy an object using "Duplicate", the copy is placed one grid space down and to the right from the original (or the previous copy).   You can use Grid Spacing to control where IconSmith places duplicate objects.Snap Influence allows you to adjust the area influenced by the "magnetic field" of the grid.LBL="" HELPID=""Controlling GravityID="chap.0248"The controls in the "Gravity Constraints" portion of the Constraints window control how gravity snap behaves.

† †        include("../iconlib/scrimshaw.fti");
† †   }The first line contains the TYPE rule, which you use to name the file type. In this case, the file type is named, scrimshaw. Always place the TYPE rule on the first line of your FTRs. The TYPE rule is described in IDREF="10863" TYPE="TITLE""Naming File Types".The second line contains the MATCH rule. Use the MATCH rule to tell the Desktop which files belong to this file type. In this example, we are just writing in the identification (tag) number that we have already assigned to the application. The MATCH rule is described in IDREF="98067" TYPE="TITLE""Matching File Types with Applications".The third line contains the LEGEND rule. Use this rule to provide a brief descriptive phrase for the file type. This phrase appears when users view a directory in list form.

The LEGEND rule is described in IDREF="34462" TYPE="TITLE""Adding a Descriptive Phrase".
† †The fourth line contains the SUPERTYPE rule. Use this rule to name a file type superset for your FTRs.

 The CMD OPEN rule is described in IDREF="33157" TYPE="TITLE""Programming Icon Open Behavior".The sixth line contains the CMD ALTOPEN rule. This rule tells the Desktop what to do when users double-click on the icon while holding down the <Alt> key. In this example, the Desktop runs† †launch(1), which brings up a text edit window so that users can type in command-line arguments to the scrimshaw executable. Again, $LEADER is a Desktop environment variable. These are listed in Appendix A. For more information on the launch command, see the launch(1) man page.

The ICON rule is described in IDREF="35039" TYPE="TITLE""Getting the Icon Picture".LBL="" HELPID=""ID="10863"Naming File TypesID="chap.032"It is important that your file type have a unique name so that it doesn't collide with Silicon Graphics types or types added by other developers. One way to create a unique type name is to include your company's initials or stock symbol. Even if you choose your type name carefully, you still need to check the existing type names to make sure that you have not duplicated an existing name. Use theID="chap.033"ID="chap.034"† †grep(1) command to search through existing .ftr files:grep your_number /usr/lib/filetype/*/*.ftr† †Substitute your proposed new type name for the words "your_number." If grep doesn't find your number, then go ahead and use it.You name a file type by using the TYPE rule.   You can define more than one file type in a single file, as long as each new file type begins with the TYPE rule. The TYPE rule always goes on the first line of the file type definition. Here is the syntax and description for the TYPE rule:Syntax:TYPE type-nameDescription:ID="chap.035"type-name is a one-word ASCII string. Legal type names can be any legal C language variable name. You should ideally choose a name that is in some way descriptive of the file type it represents. All rules that follow a TYPE declaration apply to that type, until the next TYPE declaration is encountered in the FTR file. Each TYPE declaration must have a unique type name.Example:TYPE GenericExecutableLBL="" HELPID=""ID="27184"Categorizing File TypesID="chap.036"ID="chap.037"Use the SUPERTYPE rule to tell other file types that your file type should be treated as a "subset" of a larger type such as executables or directories. For example, you can create a executable with a custom icon, then use the SUPERTYPE rule to tell other Desktop file types that the icon represents an executable. You can use any existing file type as a SUPERTYPE. For a list of existing file types, use the grep(1) command:grep TYPE /usr/lib/filetype/*/*.ftrHere is the syntax and description for the SUPERTYPE rule:Syntax:SUPERTYPE type-name [type-name ... ]Description:type-nameID="chap.038" is the TYPE name of any valid file type. Use SUPERTYPE to identify the file type as a "subset" of one or more other file types. This information can be accessed by other file types by calling isSuper(1) from within their CMD rules (OPEN, ALTOPEN, etc.). A file type may contain several SUPERTYPE rules. See the isSuper(1) man page for more information.ID="chap.039"Example:SUPERTYPE ExecutableDirectories are a special case. The Desktop automatically handles the DROP, OPEN, and ALTOPEN rules for all directories marked as `SUPERTYPE Directory'.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="98067"Matching File Types with ApplicationsID="chap.0310"ID="chap.0311"ID="12850"The Desktop needs some way to figure out which FTRs pair up with which files. Your FTRs will not work if they don't include some way for the Desktop to match them with the appropriate files. To do this, include the MATCH rule in your file type definition. This section explains how to use the MATCH rule to identify your files. The method you use depends on the kind of file you are matching and on the file permissions. First, here's the MATCH rule syntax and description:Syntax:MATCH match-expression;Description:match-expressionID="chap.0312" is a logical expression that should evaluate to true if, and only if, a file is of the type declared by TYPE. The match-expression must consist only of valid MATCH functions, as described later in this section. The match-expression can use multiple lines, but must terminate with a semicolon (;). Multiple match-expressions are not permitted for a given type. The MATCH rule is employed each time a file is encountered by the Desktop, to assign a type to that file.Example:MATCH tag == 0x00001005;The easiest way to match your application with its FTRs is to use the ID="chap.0313"ID="chap.0314"tag(1) command to assign a unique number to the application itself. You can then label the associated FTRs with this same unique number, using the MATCH rule, as shown in the example above. For more information on matching your files with the tag command, see IDREF="98067" TYPE="TITLE""Matching File Types with Applications".There are a few situations in which you cannot use† †tag to label your files. You cannot use tag if:your file is not executableyou don't have the necessary permissions to change the file† †For more information on matching your files without using the tag command, see IDREF="56776" TYPE="TITLE""Matching Files without the tag Command".ID="35959"To tag your application and its associated FTRs using the tag command, follow these steps:The tag command attaches an identification number to your application.   Before you tag your application, you need to select a number that is not already in use. Silicon Graphics assigns each company (or individual developer) a block of ID numbers for tagging files. If your company doesn't already have an assigned block of numbers, just send a request to Silicon Graphics. The best way is to e-mail your request to this e-mail address:workspacetags@sgi.comOnce you have your block of numbers, you can select a number from the block of numbers assigned to your company. Make sure that you select a number that is not in use. To verify that the number you choose is not in use, use the grep(1) command to search through all the FTR files. Begin the search by entering the cd command to change to the /usr/lib/filetype directory and type:grep "tag == your_number"Substitute the number you want to use for the words, your_number. If grep finds the number already in use, pick another number. After you select a unique tag number for your application, cd to the directory that contains your application and tag it using theID="chap.0315"† †tag command. This is the syntax:tag number filenameReplace the word† †number with the number that you are assigning to the application and filename with the name of your application. For more information on the tag command, see the tag(1) man page.After tagging the application itself, include the tag in your application's FTRs, using the MATCH rule. Just include a line like this in your FTR file:ID="chap.0316"MATCH tag ==number;where number is the unique tag number assigned to your application. You can also use the tag command to automatically assign a tag number for a predefined file type. Silicon Graphics provides a set of generic types, called predefined types, that you can use for utilities that do not require a personalized look. These predefined file types come complete with icons, FTRs, and tag numbers. Use the appropriateID="chap.0317"† †tag command arguments to get the desired file type features. For more information on tag arguments, see the tag(1) man page. The predefined file types are listed in IDREF="30180" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix D, "Predefined File Types."LBL="" HELPID=""ID="56776"Matching Files without the tag CommandIf you cannot use the tag command to match your application with the corresponding FTRs, you need to write a sequence of expressions that check files for distinguishing characteristics. Once you have written a sequence of expressions that adequately defines your application file, include that sequence in your FTR file, using the MATCH rule. For example, you can use this MATCH rule to match a C source file:MATCH glob("*.c") && ascii;The glob function returns TRUE if the file's name matches the string within the quotes. The ascii function returns TRUE if the first 512 bytes of the file are all printable ASCII characters. (IDREF="40184" TYPE="TABLE"Table 3-3
 lists all of the available match-expression functions.) The && conditional operator tells the Desktop that the functions on either side of it must both return TRUE for a valid match. See IDREF="44766" TYPE="TITLE""Valid Match-Expressions"
 for a list of all of the operators, constants and numerical representations that you can use in your match-expressions.LBL="" HELPID=""Writing Effective Match ExpressionsThe most effective way to order match-expressions in a single MATCH rule is to choose a set of expressions, each of which tests for a single characteristic, and conjoin them all using "and" conditionals (&&).The order in which you list the expressions in a MATCH rule is important. Order the expressions so that the maximum number of files are "weeded out" by the first expressions. This is advised because the conditional operator, &&, stops evaluation as soon as one side of the conditional is found to be false. Therefore, the more likely an expression is to be false, the further to the left of the MATCH rule you should place it.For instance, in the previous MATCH expression example, it is more efficient to place the glob("*.c") expression first because there are many more ASCII text files than there are files that end in .c.Since the Desktop scans FTR files sequentially, you must make sure that your match rule is specific enough not to "catch" any unwanted files. For example, suppose you define a type named "myDataFile" using this MATCH rule:MATCH ascii;Now every text file in your system will be defined as a file of type "myDataFile."LBL="" HELPID=""ID="44766"Valid Match-ExpressionsID="chap.0318"This section describes the syntax and function of valid match-expressions.  † †You can use these C language operators in a match-expression:ID="chap.0319"ID="chap.0320"

.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="35039"Getting the Icon PictureID="chap.0363"ID="chap.0364"Use the ICON rule, described in this section, to tell the Desktop where to find the file(s) containing the picture(s) of the icon for a file type. The simplest way to do this is to provide the full IRIX pathname. For example, if the ID="chap.0365"ID="chap.0366".fti file is in the directory called /usr/lib/filetype/install/iconlib, you would simply write that pathname directly into your FTR file. If you prefer not to use the absolute pathname in your FTR, you can use a relative pathname, as long as the icon file resides anywhere within the† †/usr/lib/filetype directory structure. To make use of relative pathnames, list the pathname relative to the directory containing the FTR file that contains the ICON rule. If you choose to do this, take care to keep path names used in FTR files synchronized with icon locations.For each executable there are three distinct pictures: one for the generic opened executable, one for the generic closed executable and one for the unique identifying badge that "floats" over the generic parts. To write your own ICON rule, use the icon description language, described inIDREF="25750" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix B, "The Icon Description Language."
 You need refer to IDREF="25750" TYPE="TITLE"Appendix B
 if only if you want to do something unusual. Otherwise, use the basic format from the example below to tell the Desktop where to find your icon files. Here is the syntax and description for the ICON rule:Syntax:ID="chap.0367" ICON icon-description-routine† †Description: icon-description-routine† †is a routine written using the icon description language, detailed below. The routine can continue for any number of lines. The ICON rule is invoked any time a file of the specified type needs to be displayed in the Desktop or Directory View. The rule is evaluated each time the icon is painted by the application that needs it.Example: ICON {† †  if (opened) {
† †  include("../iconlib/generic.open.fti");
† †  } else {
† †  include("../iconlib/generic.closed.fti");
† †  }
† †  include("../iconlib/ack.fti");
}The example above shows you exactly how to write the standard ICON rule. The first line invokes the ICON rule. The next two lines tell the Desktop where to find the parts of the icon representing the open and closed "flying carpet" that makes up the generic executable icons. The unique badge is in a file named ack.fti.You can use these lines for your own ICON rule routine just by substituting the appropriate pathnames, for the pathnames above (the pathnames are inside the quotes on lines 3 and 5 in the example above). Notice that this example gives the pathname of the icon files (.fti files) relative to the directory in which the FTR file is located. You can use the full pathname if you prefer. Your icon description routine would then look like this, assuming that ack.fti was placed in /usr/lib/filetype/iconlib:
ICON {
 if (opened) {
  include("/usr/lib/filetype/iconlib/generic.fti");
 } else {
  include("/usr/lib/filetype/iconlib/generic.fti");
 }
 include("/usr/lib/filetype/iconlib/ack.fti");

This chapter shows how to write FTRs for the new† †VortexApp file type. For an alternate approach, see IDREF="19991" TYPE="TITLE""How to Copy an Existing File Type".To draw and program the icon, follow these basic steps:ID="chap.043"Tag the application. Create a picture.Define a file type.Rebuild the Desktop FTR Database.Write an installation script.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="34807"Tag the ApplicationThe first step is to tag the application with its own unique identification number so that the Desktop has a way of matching theID="chap.044"† †VortexApp application with the corresponding FTRs. You cannot tag your application if it is not an executable, or if you do not have write and execute permissions for the file. If you cannot† †tag the application, skip this step. You will have to use another method to help the Desktop match your application with its FTRs. Use the method described in IDREF="56776" TYPE="TITLE""Matching Files without the tag Command".
 Since the† †VortexApp is an executable, you can tag it using the tag command. First, you need your own set of tag numbers to choose from. Send an e-mail request to Silicon Graphics at this mail address:workspacetags@sgi.comAfter Silicon Graphics sends you a block of your own registered tag numbers, you can tag your application.

 describes exactly how to draw such an icon. Save the icon in a file called VortexApp.fti. For the moment, do not worry about where to place these files; just put them anywhere that you have write permission. In this case, assume you put the files in the† †/usr/tmp directory.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="19756"Define a File TypeThis section explains how to program the VortexApp icon. This includes naming it, telling the Desktop where to find the icon files (.fti files) associated with it, and making the icon act as you want it to within the Desktop (for example, opening the application when a user double-clicks on the icon).This section assumes that you are writing your FTRs completely from scratch. You might prefer instead to modify an existing file type. To learn how to find the FTRs for an existing icon, see IDREF="19991" TYPE="TITLE""How to Copy an Existing File Type".LBL="" HELPID=""Define the Icon's BehaviorBefore programming behavior for the VortexApp icon, decide how it should act within the Desktop. Assume you decide on these behaviors:When a user double-clicks on the† †VortexApp icon, the Desktop runs the application.When a user drops another icon onto the VortexApp icon, the Desktop brings up the† †VortexApp with the file represented by the dropped icon. Users can edit this file using the VortexApp, as usual.Note that this second behavior makes no provision for rejecting icons that represent files unsuitable for editing. You could enhance the VortexApp file type by including a line that tells the Desktop to notify users when they drop an icon of the wrong SUPERTYPE onto the VortexApp icon. LBL="" HELPID=""Line 1: Name the File TypeAssume that you decide to name your new file type "VortexExecutable." Before using that name, you must first make sure that it is not already in use. Check all possible directories for the proposed file type name, since a file type defined in one directory can override a file type of the same name defined in another directory. To search for the file type name, "VortexExecutable," in the /usr/lib/filetype directory, follow these steps:cd /usr/lib/filetype† †grep "VortexExecutable" */*.ftr You must also check in the $HOME/.desktop directories:cd $HOME/.desktopgrep "VortexExecutable" */*.ftrIf you find another file type of the name you have chosen, then pick a new name for your file type. It's important to check the $HOME/.desktop directories, too, because any file type in one of these directories overrides a file type of the same name in any of the /usr/lib/filetype directories.Assume that you do not find an existing file type with the name "VortexExecutable," so it is fine to name the new file type. Using the editor of your choice, open a file in† †/usr/tmp (or anywhere you have write permissions) and name the new file type by typing in this line:TYPE VortexExecutableLBL="" HELPID=""Line 2: Classify the IconUse the SUPERTYPE rule to tell the Desktop what type of file your icon represents.

For VortexApp, assume that you create a file called VortexApp.ftr. It is not really important what you call the file, as long as the name ends with .ftr, but it is helpful if the name is reasonably descriptive. You can create the VortexApp.ftr file anywhere that you have write permissions, then move it to the appropriate directory later. In this case, assume that you put the file in the† †/usr/tmp directory.The next step is to put the FTR file in the appropriate directory. You must become superuser before you can add an FTR file to any of the FTR file directories in /usr/lib/filetype.In this case, we put the .ftr file in the /usr/lib/filetype/install directory.

You find the FTRs for† †jot, copy them to your VortexApp own FTR file, and modify them to fit your own icon.To find the set of FTRs that define the file type for the jot icon, you go to the Desktop and locate the jot icon. Since the jot file type has its own distinctive icon, its easy to find. Select the jot icon then hold down the right mouse button to get the Desktop menu.

There is often more than one sequence of conversion steps to print a file. routeprint chooses the sequence of steps that provides the best possible image quality.This modular, multi-step conversion to printable form is called the print conversion pipelineID="chap.052", a series of IRIX commands that process a copy of the file's data in modular increments. The print conversion rules are designed to take advantage of this method of processing printable files.The Desktop already has rules for printing a large number file types. You can use grep to list all these file types, by typing:grep -i convert /usr/lib/filetype/*/*.ftrLBL="" HELPID=""ID="24707"Print CostsFrequently, there is more than one set of steps that routeprint can use to print your file. To compare different ways of printing a file of a particular type, routeprint associates cost numbers with each conversion, then chooses the series of conversions with the lowest total cost. When creating print conversion rules, cost can be used to reflect processing cost, or be used as a measure of output quality. Printing cost is defined as being inversely proportional to the quality of the output.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="68180"The Print Conversion RulesThere are three parts to a complete print conversion rule:the CONVERT rulethe COST rulethe FILTER ruleLBL="" HELPID=""The CONVERT RuleID="chap.053"ID="chap.054"Syntax:CONVERT source-type-name† †destination-type-nameDescription:source-type-name is the file type you are converting from. destination-type-name is the file type you are converting to.Example:CONVERT NroffFile PostScriptFileDo not use the convert rule to convert directly to a new printer type; convert to a standard Desktop file type instead. Silicon Graphics reserves the right to alter printer types, so converting to a standard file type (for example, PostScript) is a more portable solution.LBL="" HELPID=""The COST RuleID="chap.055"ID="chap.056"Syntax:COST non-negative-integerDescription:non-negative-integer represents the ID="chap.057"arc cost, or incremental cost of the conversion. This cost is used to reflect processing complexity or can also be used inversely reflect the output quality. When routeprint selects a conversion sequence, it takes the arc costs into account, choosing the print conversion sequence with the least total cost. The COST rule is required; if you omit it, routeprint assumes the cost of the conversion is zero, which may result in inappropriate choice of printers.Example:COST 50LBL="" HELPID=""The FILTER RuleID="chap.058"ID="chap.059"Syntax:FILTER filter-expressionDescription:The FILTER rule represents part of an IRIX pipeline that prepares a file for printing. filter-expression can be any single IRIX command line expression, and generally takes the form of one or more piped commands. In the general case, the first command within a single FILTER rule receives input from stdin; the last command in the rule send its output to stdout. routeprint concatenates all the FILTER rules in the print conversion pipeline to form one continuous command that sends the selected file to its destination printer.There are three special cases in creating FILTER rules:"first" case"last" case"setvar" caseIn a "first" case rule, the FILTER rule is the very first rule in the print conversion pipeline. In this case, routeprint passes the list of selected files to the first command in the FILTER rule as arguments. If a first case FILTER rule begins with a command that does not accept the files in this fashion, prepend the cat command to your rule:FILTER cat | tbl - | psroff -tThe files will then be piped to the next command's stdin.In a "last" case rule, the FILTER rule is the very last rule in the print conversion pipeline. This rule contains a command that sends output directly to a printer (such as lp). Last case rules are already provided for many file types. To ensure compatibility between your application and future printing software releases, you should refrain from writing your own last case rules. Instead, write rules that convert from your file type to any of the existing file types, and let the built-in print conversion rules do the rest.† †In a "setvar" case rule, the FILTER rule is used to set an environment variable used later in the print conversion pipeline. The first CONVERT rule in the example below sets a variable that defines an nroff macro used in the second rule. In all setvar cases, stdin is passed to stdout transparently. Thus, you can include setvar as part of the pipeline in a single FILTER rule.CONVERT mmNroffFile NroffFIle COST 1 FILTER setvar MACRO=mmCONVERT mmNroffFile PostScriptFile COST 50 FILTER eqn | tbl | psroff -$MACRO -tLBL="" HELPID=""ID="11590"The Current Printer† †ID="chap.0510"The current printer is the system default printer that the user sets with the Print Manager or, alternatively, the printer specified by the ID="chap.0511"-p option to routeprint. If no default is set and -p is not used, an error message is returned by routeprint to either stdout or a notifier window (if the -g option to routeprint was set). routeprintID="chap.0512"ID="chap.0513"ID="chap.0514" sets the Desktop environment variable $CURRENTPRINTER to the currently selected default printer.LBL="6"ID="56674"Adding Items to the Desktop MenuID="chap.061"This chapter contains these sections:IDREF="86824" TYPE="TITLE""The Desktop Menu"IDREF="19675" TYPE="TITLE""The Transfer Menu Manager"IDREF="43942" TYPE="TITLE""Transfer Device Typing"IDREF="71396" TYPE="TITLE""Transfer Device I/O"IDREF="12364" TYPE="TITLE""Using Desktop Environment Variables"IDREF="35555" TYPE="TITLE""Local Transfer Devices"IDREF="18295" TYPE="TITLE""Example: shellDevice"LBL="" HELPID=""ID="86824"The Desktop MenuThe ID="chap.062"Desktop menu is the menu that appears when you depress the right mouse button from inside any Desktop window. There are two ways to add items to this menu:Use MENU CMD to add items to the Desktop menu only when a particular icon is selected. To learn how to do this, read IDREF="31739" TYPE="TITLE""Adding Menu Items"
.  Use the Transfer Menu Manager to add items that always appear in the Desktop menu. This is explained in this chapter.To add items that always appear in the Desktop menu, use the ID="chap.063"Transfer Menu Manager tool located in the System toolchest. LBL="" HELPID=""ID="19675"The Transfer Menu ManagerIf you open the System toolchest and select the item labeled "Transfer Menu Manager," the Transfer Menu Manager window appears on your screen. It contains icons representing ID="chap.064"transfer devices. Transfer devices are shell scripts that communicate with the Desktop and the Transfer Menu Manager through a simple set of protocols. Transfer devices exist for the rcp, tar, and cpio commands and you can add your own as necessary. Note that though the existing transfer devices are devices for transferring files, you are not restricted to file-transfer commands when writing your own transfer devices.To define new kinds of transfer devices, put a script following the correct protocol in the ID="chap.065"/etc/transferDevice directory.    An icon representing your new device appears in the Transfer Menu Manager window. This works only if you follow these steps:Write a script and install it in the /etc/transferDevice directory.Define a file type for your script. (This step is optional, but recommended.)Open the Transfer Menu Manager and select your new icon.Click on the Help Button to learn how to add your new device.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="43942"Transfer Device TypingThe second line of a transfer device script (the line after the shell invocation) must follow this form:#transferDevnamename can be any name addition to the "transferDev"prefix. The complete name (transferDevname) must correspond to a TYPE declaration in an FTR file. The Transfer Manager scans the set of file typing rules for this TYPE, and uses the associated ICON rule to draw the transfer device's icon within the Transfer Menu Manager window. When you create a new transfer device, write your own FTR rules, using the rules for standard shipped transfer devices as templates. Otherwise, the Transfer Menu Manager assigns a generic transfer device icon to the transfer device.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="71396"Transfer Device I/O† †ID="chap.066"A transfer device must be able to handle the following strings as arguments:ID="chap.067"menuversionsOKThe meaning of these strings, and the output that is associated with them, is explained in the following two sections.LBL="" HELPID=""menu The transfer device is called with this argument by both the Desktop and the Transfer Menu Manager. The transfer device must respond by echoing one or more character strings in the following format:echo "token1 menu-item-string1"† †
echo "token2 menu-item-string2"† †
...menu-item-string is the text of the menu item that you wish to appear in the Transfer submenu of the Desktop and Directory View menus; you can include spaces. These items appear only after the user sets the transfer device with the Transfer Menu Manager. A transfer device may insert any number of menu items.token is a one-word token that the Desktop uses as an argument in calling the transfer device when a user chooses its associated menu item from the Transfer submenu. Thus, your transfer device must also accept each token string as an argument, and respond with the appropriate action described in its associated menu item.LBL="" HELPID=""versionsOKWhen a user tries to set your transfer device using the Transfer Menu Manager, the device is called with ``versionsOK'' as an argument. Your device must echo one of the following strings:echo "local" echo "remote" echo "remote local"If it echoes the first string, the Transfer Menu Manager allows the user to set only the local version of the device. If it echoes the second string, the user can set only the remote versions of the device. If it echoes the last string, the user can set either version.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="12364"Using Desktop Environment VariablesCurrently, Silicon Graphics supports only the Desktop environment variable $SELECTED for use within transfer devices. This variable contains the list of selected icons from the Desktop. See IDREF="56674" TYPE="TITLE", "Adding Items to the Desktop Menu,"
 for more information.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="35555"Local Transfer DevicesYou can make a transfer device available only to a particular user, by placing the transfer device in the user's ID="chap.068"$HOME/.desktop/localTransferLinks directory. It appears in the Transfer Menu Manager window like any other transfer device, but only when you start the window system from that particular user's account.LBL="" HELPID=""ID="18295"Example: shellDeviceThis section provides an example transfer device that allows you to open a shell window on any selected directory.
