.SH DESCRIPTION
\*LXmUpdateDisplay\*O provides the application with a mechanism for forcing all
pending exposure events to be removed from the input queue and processed immediately.
When a user selects a button within a MenuPane, the MenuPanes are
unposted and then any activation callbacks registered by the application
are invoked.  If one of the callbacks performs a time-consuming action,
the portion of the application window that was covered by the MenuPanes
will not have been redrawn; normal exposure processing does not occur until
all of the callbacks have been invoked.  If the
application writer  suspects that a callback
will take a long time, then the callback may choose to invoke
\*LXmUpdateDisplay\*O before starting its time-consuming operation.
This function is also useful any time a transient window, such as a dialog box, is unposted;
callbacks are invoked before normal exposure processing can occur.
