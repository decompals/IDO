.SH DESCRIPTION
\*LXmTextGetSource\*O accesses the source of the Text widget.  Text
widgets can share sources of text so that editing in one widget is
reflected in another.  This function accesses the source of one widget
so that it can be made the source of another widget, using the function
\*LXmTextSetSource(3X)\*O.
.PP 
Setting a new text source destroys the old text source if no other Text
