		OSF/Motif DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM NOTES

These demonstration programs are to show various features of Motif.

>>  They are unsupported at this time, both by OSF and by SGI.  SGI has
>>  fixed some bugs in them.  It is known that bugs remain; bug reports
>>  are welcome, but fixing the bugs is not guaranteed.  See the Release
>>  Notes for a current list of demonstration program bugs.


If you have installed a new version of Motif over an old one, we suggest that
you first:

	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/demos
	% make clean

This is because the installation process does not delete any object files
which were built from the previously installed version.

The demo tree is shipped with X11 Imakefiles, not Makefiles.  To create the
Makefiles needed to build the programs in the demo tree:

	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/demos	# Motif demos build tree location
	% ../mmkmf			# Build the initial Makefile
	% make Makefile			# Verify the Makefile is OK
	% make Makefiles		# Update the rest of your Makefiles
	% make clean			# Otherwise, if this isn't your first
					#   installation, obsolete binaries may
					#   be left around yielding unexpected
					#   results.
	% make depend			# Update Makefile dependencies.
					#   This is also a good confidence test
					#   that everything is installed
					#   properly.

Size -- the demo tree requires about 2.5 megabytes as shipped.  With all demos
fully built, it requires about 40 megabytes.  To build the demos, once the
Makefiles have been made, you can either:

    make all of the demo programs:
	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/demos	# Top of the Motif demos tree
	% make all			# Build all of the demos

    or else, to conserve space, just make those you care about:
	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/demos/XXX	# XXX is the demo you want
	% make all			# Build all demos in that directory


To run the demos:

	* FONTS: Non-English fonts are used in such demo programs as
	  hellohebrew, hellokanji, peridickanji, and motifburint.  If you
	  don't want to run a demo which displays non-English fonts, you
	  can skip this step.

	  >>> ON THE MACHINE RUNNING THE X11 SERVER YOU WANT TO DISPLAY ON <<<,
	  (not necessarily the one you are going to execute the demos on),
	  you need to install Hebrew and Kanji fonts in the server.

		* ensure that an X client (e.g. mwm) is running
		* cd /usr/src/X11/motif/demos/fonts
		* make xset		# Install fonts on the current server

	  It is important to understand that when the X server has no more
	  clients, it resets its world.  This means that things set with
	  'xhost' and 'xset' get reinitialized.  To prevent this problem, bring
	  up any X client you wish to -- an X window manager, Xclock, ....  As
	  long as there is at least one client, the reset does not happen.

	* cd /usr/src/X11/motif/demos/<the demo you want to run>

	* read the README file in that directory, if any.  Some of the demos
	  require special things, such as setting an environment variable.

	* run the demo.
