# ============================
# if not all have max, the strips are offset from each other,
#	making correlation difficult.
# if they don't all have interval(X), they advance at different rates!
# it turns out that the first color displayed for a bar doesn't
# use index 1 in the colors option (at least for strip charts).
# the comments below indicate which index is used for each
# chart when counting the legend words from left to right
# interval 1440 while I'm gone shows a whole days worth
# 300 shows about 5 hours
