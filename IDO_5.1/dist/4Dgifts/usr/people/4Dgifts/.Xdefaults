!  The following resources define what the 4Dwm frames will look like 
!  for specific clients.  The values explicitly listed specify various 
!  elements of the window manager frame.
!  Specifying a "+" means "add this element", while no other frame 
!  elements are drawn;  "-" means "subract this element" but otherwise 
!  leave other elements untouched;  "none" means paint no window manager 
!  frame at all.

! make clients able to be placed beyond the confines of the screen proper
! (see the Toolchest -geom option in the ~/4Dgifts/.xsession file).
4DWm*positionOnScreen:		false

!  These define key, button and window menu specifications for 4Dwm.
!  The values given to these resources must be defined in $HOME/.4Dwmrc
4Dwm*keyBindings:		myKeyBindings
4Dwm*buttonBindings:		myButtonBindings
4Dwm*windowMenu:		4DwmWindowMenu

! client decoration resources turned on.
*clientDecoration: 		+resizeh +border +minimize +maximize +menu

! -RIGHTMOUSE to get 4Dwm menu).
*ipaste*clientDecoration:	none




!  The following resources define some aspects of window manager behaviour:

!  The following makes the entire window be drawn when you move it.  To 
!  use the traditional "only move an outline of the window", comment out 
!  next line.
4Dwm*moveOpaque:		true

!  Uncomment this one if you want windows to auto-raise with focus.
!4Dwm*focusAutoRaise:		true

!  Make the text that appears in the title bar of a window be centered.
!  SG_titlePadding specifies in pixels how much distance to pad above 
!  and below the text in the title bar (default is 3).
4Dwm*SG_titleLeft:		false
4Dwm*SG_titlePadding:		0

!  Window focus follows the pointer.  The other possible value for this 
!  resource is "explicit".  "pointer" means the keyboard focus policy is
!  to have the keyboard focus set to the client window that currently 
!  contains the pointer (the pointer could also be in the client window 
!  decoration).  "explicit" means the keyboard focus is set to a client 
!  window when the user presses button 1 (LEFTMOUSE) with the pointer on 
!  the client window or any part of the associated client decoration.  
4Dwm*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer

!  Define a new default font to be used by 4Dwm for menus and title bars.
!Dwm*title*fontList:		-*-palatino-bold-r-*-*-14-*
!Dwm*menu*fontList:		-*-palatino-medium-r-*-*-14-*

!  WARNING!  this makes the window manager NOT ask you to confirm if you 
!  wanna really (kill and then) restart 4Dwm.
4Dwm*showFeedback:		-restart

!  Don't allow clients to continue to draw while move operations are in 
!  process--setting freezeOnConfig to true makes window outlines not
!  flash during configuration operations.
4Dwm*freezeOnConfig:		true

!  Change the width of window borders (note:  these are different from 
!  resize borders--dialogs have borders but they're not *resize* borders).
!  (The default is 5.)
4DWm*frameBorderWidth:		2

!  Change width of *resize* borders--clients have these by default.
!  (The default here is 10.)
4Dwm*resizeBorderWidth:		2

!  User can interactively place and/or resize new windows.
4Dwm*interactivePlacement:	true
