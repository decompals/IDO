techniques described are equally applicable to and provide a good
introduction to programming with any other widget set based on Xt.
It is not difficult to convert an application between any of the
widget sets listed above, since all of them use the same Xt Intrinsics
programming interface.This book describes how to write X Window System programs
using the Xt Intrinsics library (or simply Xt).
Xt is a standard established by the X Consortium that provides
an object-oriented programming style in the C language.OSF's Motif library provides user-interface objects to be used with
Xt.  Motif is not an X Consortium standard, though it may
nevertheless become a de facto industry standard.
This book primarily describes the Xt Intrinsics, but it also provides
an introduction to Motif and uses Motif for many of the examples.The Xt Intrinsics together with a second library such as Motif are
collectively called the X Toolkit.ID="S1-1013-CH00-1"Summary of ContentsThe discussion of the X Toolkit is divided into three
volumes, Volumes Four, Five, and Six of the X Window System Series
available from O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.This is Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual, Motif Edition.
It provides an explanation
of the X Toolkit, including tutorial material and
numerous programming examples.  Arranged by task or topic, each
chapter brings together a group of Xt functions, describes the
conceptual foundation on which they are based, and illustrates how they
are most often used in writing applications.
This volume is structured to be useful as a tutorial and also
as a task-oriented reference.Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual,
includes reference pages for each of the Xt functions, as well as for
the widget classes defined by Xt, organized alphabetically for ease
of reference; a permuted index; and numerous appendices and quick
reference aids.Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual provides detailed,
practical instructions for building real applications with the
Motif widget set.The three volumes are designed to be used together.
To get the most out of the examples in Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual, you will need the
exact calling sequences of each function from Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual.  To
understand fully how to use each of the functions described 
in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, 
all but the most experienced Toolkit "hacker" will need the
explanation and examples in Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual.  Volume Six, X Toolkit Widget Reference Manual gives you
the specifics of using each Motif widget and guidance in practical
programming.Volumes Four and Five include material from the original Toolkit
documentation provided by MIT, though in Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual this material is
mostly limited to the appendices.  We have done our best to
incorporate all the useful information from the MIT documentation,
to reorganize and present it in a more useful form, and to
supplement it with conceptual material, tutorials, reference aids,
and examples.
In other words, this manual is not only a replacement
but is a superset of the MIT documentation.Those of you familiar with the MIT documentation will recognize that
each reference page in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual includes the detailed description
of the routine found in
X Toolkit Intrinsics--C Language Interface, plus in many
cases additional text that clarifies ambiguities and describes the
context in which the routine would be used.  We have also added the
definitions of structures and symbolic constants used as arguments or
returned values by the function, as well as
cross-references to related reference pages and to where
additional information can be found in Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual.ID="S1-1013-CH00-2"AssumptionsThis book makes no assumptions about the reader's knowledge
of object-oriented programming or the X Window System.
ID="IX-1013-CH00-1"objectsobject-oriented programming
Readers should be proficient in the C
programming language, although examples are provided for
infrequently used features of the language that are necessary or useful
when programming with the X Toolkit.  In addition, general familiarity
with the principles of raster graphics will be helpful.However,
even though the Toolkit is intended to hide the low-level X interface
provided by Xlib, there are times in writing applications or widgets
when Xlib
functions will be necessary because no Xt feature exists to do
the same thing.  This book describes the most common
occasions for using Xlib, but does not provide a reference to the
particular functions involved.  Additional documentation on Xlib, such as that provided by
ENDTERM="XLib_PG" LINKEND="DI-1002-1-1"Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, and Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, Xlib Reference Manual, will be indispensable.ID="S1-1013-CH00-3"Related DocumentsSeveral other books and a journal on the X Window System are available

W. Kernighan and D. M. RitchieID="S1-1013-CH00-4"How to Use This ManualVolume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual explains both application programming with widgets and
widget programming (the design and coding of new widgets).The first five chapters treat widgets largely as "black boxes,"which is appropriate considering the object-oriented philosophy
of the Toolkit.  These chapters also provide an overview of many
elements of the X Toolkit, and so are appropriate for all
readers.Chapter 1LINKEND="CH-1013-1-1""Introduction to the X Window System," provides a
discussion of the context in which X programs operate.  Programmers
who are comfortable programming with Xlib can skip LINKEND="CH-1013-1-1""Chapter 1, Introduction to the X Window System."Chapter 2LINKEND="CH-1013-2-1""Introduction to the X Toolkit and Motif," describes the conceptual
foundations
underlying Toolkit programming, and shows how to write
simple programs that use widgets from existing widget sets.  It
introduces such fundamental Toolkit programming concepts as
resources, the Translation Manager, callbacks, and actions.Chapter 3LINKEND="CH-1013-3-1""More Techniques for Using Widgets," describes how to use some of the more complex
widgets found in applications, including
composite widgets, constraint widgets, and popups.  It also describes
how to define application resources and command-line options, and how to
hardcode the value of widget resources when you create a widget.
Finally, it describes how to create
multiple top-level windows, and how to use application contexts to
create applications that are more portable.Chapter 4LINKEND="CH-1013-4-1""An Example Application," describes a complete application, in several
iterations.  First, it shows a simple version of the program,
a bitmap editor, as it
would be written assuming the existence of a BitmapEdit widget
(which is actually developed in LINKEND="CH-1013-6-1""Chapter 6, Inside a Widget").
Then, two refined versions are developed, each
demonstrating additional Toolkit programming
techniques.  Finally, the same application is shown as it would
be written if the bitmap editor were implemented in an
application window rather than with the BitmapEdit widget,
as it would be written if no BitmapEdit widget existed.Chapter 5LINKEND="CH-1013-5-1""More About Motif," describes and illustrates the widgets available in the Motif 1.1
widget set, and introduces the features and functions provided
by Motif that add to the programming model defined by Xt.
As mentioned earlier, this volume does not contain detailed reference
information on each widget, and it gives examples using
only a few of the widgets in the Motif widget set.
Additional information on each Motif widget is presented in Volume Six, X Toolkit Widget Reference Manual
(available Spring '91).The next two chapters describe widget internals, and the process of
creating new widgets.  While this information is not essential
for all application programmers, many applications require
a custom widget to implement their special graphics capabilities.Chapter 6LINKEND="CH-1013-6-1""Inside a Widget," describes the code inside a widget.
Much of this code is common to all widgets.  You can think of it
as a framework that Xt uses to implement a widget's features.
After reading this chapter, you should understand the
procedure for creating your own widget around this framework.Chapter 7LINKEND="CH-1013-7-1""Basic Widget Methods," describes a widget's initialize, expose,
set_values, destroy, resize, and
query_geometry methods.  (A widget's
methods are internal routines called automatically by Xt to give the
widget a degree of independence from the application.)  The chapter
explains when Xt calls each method, and describes in detail
what should be in each of these methods.
Among other things, these methods prepare for
and do the drawing of graphics that appear in a widget.
This chapter describes what the Toolkit adds to the graphics model
provided by Xlib but does not describe in detail how to draw using
Xlib; this topic is described in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of ENDTERM="XLib_PG" LINKEND="CH-1002-5-1"Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.Later chapters treat various topics of interest to either
application or widget programmers, or both.  Some of these topics have
been introduced in the earlier chapters and are explored
more completely in the following ones.Chapter 8LINKEND="CH-1013-8-1""Events, Translations, and Accelerators," describes the complete syntax of translation tables,
which allow the user to configure
the mapping of event sequences into widget actions.
It also describes accelerators, a mechanism for mapping events
in one widget to actions in another.Chapter 9LINKEND="CH-1013-9-1""More Input Techniques," describes how to
handle events with event handlers and how to use information from the
event structure inside an event handler or action routine.  It also
describes how to get file, pipe, or socket input, how to use timeouts
to call a function after a delay or at particular intervals, and how
to use work procedures to do background processing.
Finally, it
discusses some low-level features of Xt for directly interacting with
the event queue.Chapter 10LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Resource Management and Type Conversion," is a more thorough discussion of how resources work and how they should
be used.  This chapter describes in detail the resource file format and
the rules that govern the precedence of resource settings.  It also
describes how to add your own type converter so that you can set
application- or widget-specific data through resources.
Finally, it describes subresources and how to use them.Chapter 11LINKEND="CH-1013-11-1""Interclient Communications," discusses
communication through the X server between an application and the window
manager, and between two applications.  The application-window manager
communication is performed by code in the Shell widget.  The
application sets shell resources to control this communication with
the window manager.  Application-application communication is usually
done with a process called selections.  This form of communication is
already implemented in most widgets that display text, but you may
want to implement it in your own custom widgets.  Selections can also
pass other kinds of data such as graphics.Chapter 12LINKEND="CH-1013-12-1""Geometry Management," discusses how composite and constraint widgets manage the layout of
widgets, and how to write your own simple composite and constraint
widgets.Chapter 13LINKEND="CH-1013-13-1""Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups," describes how menus work and describes several ways to create menu
widgets.  One of these ways involves the use of windowless
widgets, or gadgets.  This chapter also describes how
to use more advanced features of the Xt popup
mechanism, including modal cascades, to implement cascading popup
menus.Chapter 14LINKEND="CH-1013-14-1""Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques," describes various Xt functions and techniques that have not been treated
elsewhere in the book.  These include functions for error and
warning handling, case conversion, using editres and so on.Appendix ALINKEND="AX-1013-A-1""Athena, OPEN LOOK, and Motif," provides a comparison of the widgets
available in AT&T's OPEN LOOK widget set and OSF's Motif.
These widgets are contrasted with those in the Athena widget set.Appendix BLINKEND="AX-1013-B-1""Specifying Fonts and Colors," gives information on the
values that can be used when specifying fonts and colors as
resources.Appendix CLINKEND="AX-1013-C-1""Naming Conventions," describes a suggested set of conventions for
naming widgets and elements within widget code.Appendix DLINKEND="AX-1013-D-1""Release Notes," describes the changes between Release 4 and
Release 5.  This manual describes Release 4 and Release 5.Appendix ELINKEND="AX-1013-E-1""The xbitmap Application," shows the complete code for an advanced version
of the xbitmap application and the BitmapEdit widget, which are
described in Chapters 6 and 7.Appendix FLINKEND="AX-1013-F-1""Sources of Additional Information," lists
where to get the X software, lists companies that offer training in X
programming, and describes additional books on the subject that
have been or soon will be published.Glossarygives you somewhere to turn should you

in a number of ways: by ftp, ftpmail, bitftp, and uucp.
The cheapest, fastest, and easiest ways are listed first.  If 
you read from the top down, the first one that works for you is 
probably the best.  Use ftp if you are directly on the 
Internet.  Use ftpmail if you are not on the Internet but can send
and receive electronic mail to internet sites (this includes 
CompuServe users).  Use BITFTP if you send electronic mail via BITNET.
Use UUCP if none of the above works.ID="S2-1013-CH00-1"FTPTo use FTP, you need a machine with direct access to the

receive electronic mail to and from Internet sites.  This includes 
most workstations that have an email connection to the outside 
world, and CompuServe users.
You do not need to be directly on the Internet.  
Here's how to do it.You send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  In the message body, give 
the name of the anonymous ftp host and the ftp commands you want to 
run.  The server will run anonymous ftp for you and mail the files 
back to you.  To get a complete help file, send a
message with no subject and the single word "help" in the body.
The following is an example mail session that should get you 
the examples.  This command sends you a listing of the files in the
selected directory, and the requested examples file.  The listing is 
useful in case there's a later version of the examples you're

IBM-compatible PCs and Apple Macintoshes.
The examples are available by UUCP via modem from UUNET; UUNET's 
connect-time charges apply.  You can get the examples from UUNET whether you have an account or 
not.  If you or your company has an account with UUNET, you will have
a system with a direct UUCP connection to UUNET.  Find that system,

If you don't have an account but would like one so that you can
get electronic mail, then contact UUNET at 703-204-8000.If you don't have a UUNET account, you can set up a UUCP connection
to UUNET using the phone number 1-900-468-7727.  As of this writing, 
the cost is 50 cents per minute.  The charges will appear on your 
next telephone bill.  The login name is "uucp" with no password.

above, you're ready to compile them.  The easiest way is to
use imake, a program supplied with the X11 distribution that
generates proper Makefiles on a wide variety of systems.)
imake uses configuration files called Imakefiles which are
included.  If you have imake, you should go
to the top-level directory containing the examples, and type:ID="SC-1013-CH00-9"% xmkmf
% make Makefiles
% makeAll the application-defaults files are in the main examples directory.
The application-defaults files are not automatically installed in
the system
application-defaults directory (usually
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults on UNIX systems).LINKEND="FN-1013-CH00-1"ID="FN-1013-CH00-1"On Sun systems under OpenWindows it is usually /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults.
If you have permission to
write to that directory, you can copy them there yourself.
Or you may set the XAPPLRESDIR environment
variable to the complete path of the directory where you installed
the examples.  The value of XAPPLRESDIR must end with a / (slash).
(Most of the examples will not function properly without the
application-defaults files.)ID="S1-1013-CH00-12"AcknowledgmentsAs mentioned above, this manual includes some material
from the X Toolkit Intrinsics--C Language Interface, by
Paul Asente and Ralph Swick.
This is the document that defines the X Consortium standard for Xt,
known as the Xt specification.  Overt borrowings from
the Xt specification are rare in this volume.  However, the Xt
specification document, as well as the sample code of Xt
distributed with releases of X, provides the
intellectual basis for most of what appears here.
Many thanks to the X Consortium for their copyright policy
that allows others to build on their work.We'd like to thank Sony Microsystems for the loan of a Sony
NEWS workstation running their implementation of the X Window
System.  The speed and power of the Sony workstation, and the
support of Sony's staff, were a great help in developing these
books.  Additional development was done on a Sun-3 workstation
running MIT's sample server, a Visual 640 X Display Station, and
an NCD16 Network Display Station.We would also like to thank the reviewers of the Alpha draft of this
book, even though we almost had to start over because of their comments.
They were David Lewis of Integrated Computer Solutions
(ICS), Wendy Eisner of Sunquest Information Systems,
Dan Heller of Island Graphics, Inc. (now working with O'Reilly and
Associates), Miles O'Neal of Systems and Software Solutions, Inc., and
Chris Peterson of MIT Project Athena (now of the X Consortium).
Ian Darwin of SoftQuad and Bradley Ross of Cambridge Computer
Associates reviewed the Beta draft.
Extra thanks are due to Ralph Swick, Chris Peterson, and Robert
Scheifler, who answered many questions during the development of this
book.Of course, we alone take responsibility for any errors or omissions that
remain.Special thanks go to Mark Langley, who wrote an early draft of
this book.  He helped to educate us about the Toolkit, and his
efforts to make the book a success did not go unnoticed.Special thanks also go to Integrated Computer Solutions, for their
assistance in preparing this Motif edition.  
Thanks to Chris Peterson for permission to use 
his material on editres.Of course, the authors would like to thank the entire staff of
O'Reilly and Associates for producing the book, and the staff of
Cambridge Computer Associates, Inc., for lending their support.
David Flanagan and Paula Ferguson 
provided much of the information on Release 5 and Motif 1.2.Perhaps most of all, we would like to thank our readers and customers
for their
patience, which we tested by promising that this book would be finished
next month--every month for the last eight months.  These
days, with word processors, it is easy to generate a book-length
manuscript, but no easier than it ever was to carve that text into
something worth reading.  We have had that book-length manuscript for
a year, but have not been satisfied until now that it presented the
material in a clear, friendly, and authoritative manner.  We hope
that the extra time we have spent boiling down the facts about this
very new and continuously advancing subject will prove worthwhile to
you, the reader. --Adrian Nye and Tim O'ReillyID="CH-1013-1-1" NUMBER="1"Introduction to the X Window SystemIntroduction to the X Window SystemThis chapter introduces many of the most important concepts on which
the X Window System is based, and describes the environment in which
the X Toolkit operates.  This chapter assumes that you are new to
programming the X Window System.  If you already have some experience
programming the X Window System, you may wish to skim this chapter for
a brief review or even begin with Chapter 2.The X Window 
System (or simply X)LINKEND="FN-1013-1-1"

operating system-independent windowing system.  It was
developed jointly by MIT and Digital Equipment Corporation, and has been
adopted by the computer industry as a standard for graphics applications.ID="IX-1013-1-1"XaboutX controls a "bit-mapped" display in which each pixel on the
screen is individually controllable.  This allows applications
to draw pictures as well as text.
Until recently, individual control of screen
pixels was widely available only on personal computers (PCs) and
high-priced technical workstations.
Most general-purpose machines were limited to output on text-only terminals.
X brings a consistent world of graphic output to both PCs and more
powerful machines.
LINKEND="FG-1013-01-1"Figure 1-1 compares an X application to an application
running on a traditional text terminal.
ID="IX-1013-1-2"screenID="FG-1013-01-1"An X application, and an application on a traditional text terminalFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="01.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-1-1"Like other windowing systems, X divides the screen into multiple
input and output areas called windows.
Using a terminal emulator, windows can act as "virtual
terminals," running ordinary text-based applications.  However,
as shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-01-1"Figure 1-1, windows can also run applications designed
to take advantage of the graphic power of the bitmapped display.X takes user input from a
pointer.  The pointer is usually a mouse but
ID="IX-1013-1-3"pointerabout
could just as well be a track-ball or a tablet.
The pointer allows the user
to control a program without using the keyboard, by pointing
at objects drawn on the screen such as menus and command buttons.
This method of using programs is often easier to learn than traditional
keyboard control because it is more intuitive.
LINKEND="FG-1013-01-2"Figure 1-2 shows an application with a typical three-button pointer being used to
select a menu item.ID="FG-1013-01-2"A three-button mouse directing the pointer to select a menu itemFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="01.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-1-2"Of course, X also handles keyboard input.  The pointer directs keyboard
input from window to window.  Only one window at a time can receive
keyboard input.In X, as in many other window systems, each application need not
(and usually does not) consist of a single window.  Any part
of an application can have its own separate subwindow, which simplifies the
management of input and output within the application code.  Such child
windows are visible only within the confines of their parent window.ID="IX-1013-1-4"coordinate systemID="IX-1013-1-5"drawingcoordinate system
Windows are rectangular and oriented along the
same axes as the edges of the display.LINKEND="FN-1013-1-2"ID="FN-1013-1-2"Note however that there is a standard extension, Shape, that
supports non-rectangular windows.
Each window has its own coordinate system, with the origin in the
upper-left corner of the window inside its border.
The application or the user can change the
dimensions of windows.
LINKEND="FG-1013-01-3"Figure 1-3 shows a typical screen
with several virtual terminals running.  The screen also shows some
applications, such as xterm, oclock,
and xcalc, that run in their own windows.ID="FG-1013-01-3"Screen layout of a typical user's X Window SystemFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="01.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-1-3"ID="IX-1013-1-6"screenexample of typical X WindowX supports both color and black-and-white displays.ID="IX-1013-1-7"XX ProtocolID="IX-1013-1-8"protocolnetwork
Many of the above characteristics are also true of several other
window systems.  What is unusual about X is that it is based on
a network protocol instead of on system-specific procedure and system calls.
This network protocol enables X to be ported to
different computer architectures and operating systems;
it also allows programs to run on one architecture or operating
system while displaying on another.
Because of its unique design, X can make a network of
different computers cooperate.  For example, a computationally
intensive application might run on a supercomputer, but take
input from and display output on a workstation connected across a
local area network.  To the user, the
application would simply appear to be running on the
workstation.ID="S1-1013-1-1"The Server and ClientTo allow programs to be run on one machine and display on another,
X was designed as a network protocol--a predefined set of
requests and replies--between two processes.  One of these processes
is an application program called a client, and the other,
the server, controls the display hardware,
keyboard, and pointer.
ID="IX-1013-1-9"serveraboutID="IX-1013-1-10"clientclient-server modelThe user sits at the machine running the server.
At first, this use of the word "server" may seem a little odd, since
file and print servers normally are remote machines, but the usage is
consistent.  The local display is accessible
to other systems across the network, and for those systems
the X server does act like other types of server.The X server acts as an intermediary between user programs
(called clients or applications)
and the resources of the local system such as the keyboard and screen.
It contains all device-specific code, and insulates applications
from differences among display hardware.
The server (without extensions) performs the following tasks:MARK="BULLET"Allows access to the display by multiple clients.  The server may deny
access from clients running on certain machines.Interprets network messages from clients and acts on them.
These messages are known as requests.  Some requests command the server
to move windows and do two-dimensional drawing, while others
ask the server for information.  Protocol requests are generated
by client calls to Xlib, either directly or through Xt
and other function libraries.Passes user input to clients by sending network messages
known as events, which represent key or button presses, pointer
motion, and so forth.
Events are generated asynchronously, and
events from different devices may be intermingled.  The server
must pass the appropriate events to each client.
The client must be prepared to handle any event it has selected at
any time.Maintains complex data structures, including windows
and fonts, so that the server can perform its tasks efficiently.
Clients refer to these abstractions by ID numbers.
Server-maintained abstractions reduce the amount of data that has to be
maintained by each client and the amount of data that has to be
transferred over the network.ID="IX-1013-1-11"serveraboutID="IX-1013-1-12"displayaboutID="IX-1013-1-13"screenaboutIn X, the term display is often used as a
synonym for server, as is the combined term display server.
However, the terms display and screen are not synonymous.
A screen is the actual hardware on which the graphics are
drawn.  A server may control more than one screen.  For example,
a single server might control both a color screen and a monochrome screen,
allowing users to debug an application on both types of screen
without leaving their seat.ID="IX-1013-1-14"clientaboutThe user programs displaying on screens managed by a server are
called its clients.  There may be several clients connected
to a single server.  Clients may run on the same machine as the
server if that machine supports multitasking, or clients
may run on other machines in the network.  In either case,
the X Protocol is used by the client to send requests to
draw graphics or to query the server for information, and is used by the
server to send user input and replies to information requests
back to the client.LINKEND="FN-1013-1-3"ID="FN-1013-1-3"The X Protocol runs on top of any lower-level network protocol that
provides bidirectional communication, and delivers bytes unduplicated
and in sequence.  TCP/IP and DECnet are the most common low-level
network protocols currently supported by X servers.
All communication between client and server uses the X Protocol.
The communication path between a client and the server is called a
connection.It is common for a user to have programs running on several
different hosts in the network, all invoked from and
displaying their windows on a single screen (see
LINKEND="FG-1013-01-4"Figure 1-4).
Clients running remotely can be started from the remote machine
or from the local machine using the network utilities
rlogin or rsh.ID="FG-1013-01-4"Applications can run on any system across the networkFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="01.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-1-4"ID="IX-1013-1-15"distributed processingThis use of the network is known as distributed processing.
It allows
graphic output for powerful systems that don't have their own
built-in graphics facilities.
Distributed processing can also help solve the problem of unbalanced
system loads.  When one host machine is overloaded, users running
clients on that machine can arrange for some of their clients to run
on other hosts.
Eventually there may be automatic load-balancing applications,
but currently such remote execution is performed manually.
It is not unusual to see users in the X environment having
several xload load monitor applications running on various systems
throughout the network but displaying on their screen, so that they can see
the balance of loads throughout the network.Before leaving the subject of servers and clients, we should
mention PC servers and X terminals.  Software is available
that allows various types of PCs to operate as X servers.LINKEND="FN-1013-1-4"ID="FN-1013-1-4"Companies such as Graphics Software
Systems, Interactive Systems, and Locus Computing offer server
implementations for IBM-compatible PCs.  White Pine Software
offers an X server that runs under Multifinder on the Macintosh.
An Amiga server is available from GfxBase/Boing.  X terminals
are available from Visual Technology, NCR, Network Computing Devices
(NCD), Tektronix, Graphon Corp, and other companies.  The number of X
products on the market is growing rapidly.
X terminals are special-purpose devices designed to run just an X server,
and to connect to remote systems over a local area network.
PC servers and X terminals are the least expensive way to provide
an X screen for a user.
Since most PCs use single-tasking operating systems,
they can't run any clients at the same time as the server.  Therefore,
they too require a network adapter to connect to another system where
clients are run.X terminals and PC servers both demonstrate the strength of X's
client-server model.  Even though PCs and X terminals aren't able
to do multitasking on their own, they give the user the effect of
multitasking workstations, because they can interact simultaneously
with several clients running on remote multitasking systems.ID="S1-1013-1-2"The Software HierarchyThis book is about writing client applications for the X Window System,
in C, using the Xt Intrinsics library and a set of widgets.
This is only one of the many ways to write X applications, since X
is not restricted to a single language or operating system.  The only
requirement of an X application is that it generate and receive X
protocol messages according to the X Consortium Protocol 
specification.LINKEND="FN-1013-1-5"ID="FN-1013-1-5"Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual, provides a
conceptual discussion of the X Protocol and its detailed specification.
However, using the Xt Intrinsics and a widget set is, and is expected
to be, the most common way of writing applications for
several reasons:MARK="BULLET"It is quite powerful.It results in applications that cooperate well with other X applications.It supports several popular user-interface conventions.The C Language is widely available.ID="IX-1013-1-16"software architectureLINKEND="FG-1013-01-5"Figure 1-5  shows the layering of software in an application
that uses the Xt Intrinsics and a widget set.  Notice that the
Intrinsics are based upon Xlib, the lowest-level C-Language interface
to X.  Xlib provides full access to the capabilities of the X
Protocol, but does little to make programming easier.  It handles the
interface between an application and the network, and includes some
optimizations that encourage efficient network usage.ID="FG-1013-01-5"The software architecture of Xt Intrinsics-based applicationsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="01.05.gif" ID="GC-1013-1-5"ID="IX-1013-1-17"widgetsaboutID="IX-1013-1-18"widgetssets; aboutXt is built upon Xlib.  The
purpose of Xt is to provide an object-oriented layer that supports the
user-interface abstraction called a widget.  A widget is
a reusable, configurable piece of code that operates independently of
the application except through prearranged interactions.
A widget set is a collection of widgets that provide commonly used
user-interface components tied together with a consistent appearance
and user interface (also called look and feel).
Several different widget sets are available from various
vendors that are designed to work with Xt.
The use of widgets separates
application code from user-interface code and provides
ready-to-use user-interface components such as buttons and scrollbars.
Xt, widgets, and widget sets are described in much more
detail in LINKEND="CH-1013-2-1""Chapter 2, Introduction to the X Toolkit."ID="IX-1013-1-19"IntrinsicsaboutIn this book, we'll refer to the combination of the Xt Intrinsics and
one widget set as the X Toolkit or just the Toolkit.
When referring to the Xt Intrinsics layer alone, we'll use
Xt, or the Intrinsics.Applications often need to call Xlib directly to
accomplish certain tasks such as drawing.  Xt does not provide
its own graphics calls, nor does it provide access to every X
protocol feature.
This book describes the
features of Xlib that you may need from an Xt application, but it will not repeat the detailed description of Xlib programming found in ENDTERM="XLib_PG" LINKEND="DI-1002-1-1"Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.  You will find Volume One and Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, invaluable when you need to make Xlib calls.Xlib, Xt, and several widget sets are available on MIT's public software distribution.  The Motif and OPEN LOOK widget sets are not on the Release 4 or 5 distributions from MIT, but they are available for minimal cost from the vendors themselves (OSF, AT&T, or Sun, respectively.)
The darkly shaded areas of LINKEND="FG-1013-01-5"Figure 1-5  indicate interfaces that are exclusive standards of the X Consortium.  That Xlib is
an exclusive standard means that computer manufacturers wishing to comply with the X Consortium
standard must offer Xlib and cannot offer any other low-level X interface in C.  The lightly shaded areas (such as the Xt Intrinsics) are nonexclusive standards--vendors are required to provide Xt but are also
allowed to provide other toolkit-level layers for the C Language.
For example, Sun and AT&T offer Xt, but they also offer XView as
an alternate C-Language toolkit-level layer.  XView was originally
designed for porting existing SunView‘ applications to X, but
it can also be used for writing new applications.  Volume Seven, XView Programming Manual,
describes programming with XView.
ID="IX-1013-1-20"XXViewX software is unlike that of many other window systems in that it was
designed to provide mechanism without mandating any certain style of
user interface.  In the words of its designers, X provides
"mechanism without policy."  The Xlib and Xt layers are standard because they
can support any kind of interface.  It is the widget set that actually
imposes user-interface conventions, and it is this layer
for which no standard has yet been considered by the X Consortium.
However, because there is a strong
need in the market for one or two standard widget sets that
provide consistent appearance and user-interface conventions,
it is likely that one or two widget sets will emerge as de-facto
standards in the near future.
ID="IX-1013-1-21"mechanism without policyIt is important to note that the X Consortium standards for Xlib
and Xt define the
programming interface to each library
(often referred to as the Application Programmer's Interface, or
API), not the underlying code.
This means that vendors are allowed to modify or rewrite the code
to gain the best performance from their particular system, as long
as they keep the programming interface the same.  To you, the
application writer and user of the Intrinsics, this means that
you must always rely on documented behavior if you want your
application to run on different systems.  You must avoid
accessing private structures, because they may be different in another
vendor's release of the library, or they may be changed in a future
release of X.ID="S1-1013-1-3"Event-driven ProgrammingID="IX-1013-1-22"eventsevent-driven programmingProgramming a graphically-based window system is fundamentally
different from standard procedural programming.  In traditional
character-based interfaces, once the application starts, it is
always in control.  It knows only what kind of input it will
allow, and may define exclusive modes to limit that
input.  For example,
the application might ask the user for input with a menu, and use
the reply to go down a level to a new menu, where the actions that
were possible at the previous
level are no longer available.   Or a text editor may operate in
one mode in which keyboard input is interpreted as editor
commands, and another in which it is interpreted as data to be
stored in an editor buffer.  In any case, only keyboard input is
expected.In a window system, by contrast, multiple graphic applications
may be running simultaneously.  In addition to the keyboard, the
user can use the pointer to select data, click on buttons or
scrollbars, or change the keyboard focus from one application
to another.  Except in special cases (for example, where a
"dialog box" will not relinquish control
until the user provides some necessary information), applications
are modeless--the user can suddenly switch from the keyboard to
the mouse, or from one application area to another.  Furthermore,
as the user moves and resizes windows on the screen, application
windows may be obscured or redisplayed.  The application must be
prepared to respond to any one of many different events at any
time.
ID="IX-1013-1-23"eventsaboutID="IX-1013-1-24"eventsExposeID="IX-1013-1-25"eventsExposeID="IX-1013-1-26"exposeexposure; events, ExposeID="IX-1013-1-27"eventsaboutAn X event is a data structure sent by the server that describes
something that just happened that may be of interest to the application.
There are two major categories of events:  user input and window
system side effects.  For example, the user pressing a keyboard key
or clicking a mouse button
generates an event; a window being moved on the screen also
generates events--possibly in other applications as well if the
movement changes the
visible portions of their windows.  It is the server's job to
distribute events to the various windows on the screen.Event-driven window programming reduces
modes to a minimum, so that the user does not need to navigate a
deep menu structure and can perform any action at any time.
The user, not the application, is in control.
The application simply performs some setup and
then goes into a loop from which application functions may be
invoked in any order as events arrive.
ID="IX-1013-1-28"eventsevent-driven programmingID="S1-1013-1-4"The Window ManagerID="IX-1013-1-29"window manageraboutBecause multiple applications can be running
simultaneously, rules must exist for arbitrating conflicting
demands for input.  For example, does keyboard input
automatically go to whichever window the pointer is in, or must
the user explicitly select a window?  How does
the user move or resize windows?Unlike most window systems, X itself makes no rules about this
kind of thing.  Instead,
there is a special client called the window manager that
manages the positions and sizes of the main windows of applications
on a server's display.  In Motif, this client is mwm.
The window manager is just another client, but
by convention it is given special responsibility
to mediate competing demands for the physical resources of a display,
including screen space, color resources, and the keyboard.
The window manager allows the user to move
windows around on the screen, resize them, and usually start new
applications.  The window manager also defines much of the
visible behavior of the window system, such as whether windows
are allowed to overlap or are forced to tile (side by side), and whether
the keyboard focus simply follows the pointer from one window
to the next window, or whether the user must click a pointer button in a
window to change the keyboard focus.ID="IX-1013-1-30"window managerhintsApplications are required to give the window manager certain information
to help it mediate competing demands for screen space or other
resources.  For example,
an application specifies its preferred size and size increments.
These are known as window manager hints because the window
manager is not required to honor them.
The Toolkit provides an easy way for applications to set window
manager hints.ID="IX-1013-1-31"ICCCMID="IX-1013-1-32"Inter-Client Communication Conventions ManualICCCM
The conventions for interaction with the window manager and
with other clients have been standardized by the X Consortium
in a manual called the Inter-Client
Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM for short).
The ICCCM defines basic policy intentionally omitted from X
itself, such as the rules for transferring selections of data between
applications, for transferring keyboard focus,
for installing colormaps, and so on.As long as applications and window managers follow the
conventions set out in the ICCCM, applications created with
different toolkits will be able to coexist and work together on
the same server.
Toolkit applications should be immune to the effects
of changes from earlier conventions because the conventions are
implemented by code hidden in
a standard widget called Shell.  However, you should be aware that
some older applications and window managers do not play by the
current rules.ID="S1-1013-1-5"Extensions to XID="IX-1013-1-33"extensionsaboutID="IX-1013-1-34"Xextensions toX is also extensible.  The
code includes a defined mechanism for incorporating extensions, so
that vendors aren't forced to modify the existing system in
incompatible ways when adding features.  An extension requires
an additional piece of software on the server side and an
additional library at the same level as Xlib on the client side.
After an initial query to see whether the server portion of the
extension software is installed, these extensions are used just as
Xlib routines and perform at the same level.As time goes on, some extensions will become a basic part of what
is called "X," and will become X Consortium standards
themselves.  For example, as of Release 5 the X Consortium has
standardized three extensions: the non-rectangular window
Shape extension, the X Input extension for supporting input devices
other than the keyboard and mouse, and PEX for 3-D graphics.
The only one of these libraries that is widely available on
X servers, and is commonly used in conjunction with
Xt, is the Shape extension.  The C programming library used to
access the Shape extension is -lXext.
ID="IX-1013-1-35"librariesXextID="CH-1013-2-1" NUMBER="2"Introduction to the X Toolkit and MotifIntroduction to the X Toolkit and MotifThis chapter provides a conceptual introduction to the X Toolkit
(including the Motif widget set),
followed by a practical tutorial that starts with the most
fundamental toolkit program, a "hello world" type application
consisting of only a single widget.  This application is
successively refined until the major elements of any X Toolkit
program have been introduced.It is difficult to build applications that have a graphical user interface
using a low-level programming library such as Xlib.
To simplify development, each of the user-interface
elements of a graphical application--scrollbars, command buttons,
dialog boxes, popup or pulldown menus (everything but the main
application window)--should ideally be available ready-made,
so the programmer need only integrate them with the application code.The purpose of the X Toolkit is to provide such a simplified
approach to graphical user-interface programming.
However, in keeping with the X philosophy of
"mechanism, not policy," the designers of the X Toolkit didn't
develop a fixed set of components with a
predefined look and feel.  Instead, they created
a general mechanism for producing reusable user-interface components
so that these components can be built either by the application
programmer himself, or
by lower-level "object programmers" and then collected in
libraries for use by the application.
Motif is such a library of ready-to-use
user-interface elements.ID="IX-1013-2-1"widgetsaboutThe heart of the Toolkit is a
C library called Xt, also known as the X Toolkit
Intrinsics.  Xt provides routines for creating
and using user-interface components called widgets.
A typical application uses Xt along with a
library of pre-built widgets (a widget set)
such as Motif. This widget set includes menus, dialog boxes,
scrollbars, command buttons, and so forth, which all work together
to provide a consistent "look and feel" for an application.ID="S1-1013-2-1"Programming with WidgetsThe simplest way to understand the role of widgets in an application is
to look at a hypothetical application, as shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-02-1"Figure 2-1.ID="FG-1013-02-1"A widget-based application (simulated)FORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-1"If you are at all familiar with graphical applications, you will

A scrollbar, which allows the user to scroll data visible in
a display window.  (The position of a "thumb" within
the scrollbar indicates the position of the visible
data within a larger data buffer, and lets the user change the
current position in the buffer by dragging the thumb with the mouse.  Widget
sets have various names for the scrollbar thumb.)A data entry area, in which the user can type
information requested by the application.Other widgets in the application may not be as obvious:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-2-6"composite widgetsclassID="IX-1013-2-7"composite widgetsaboutComposite widgets, which are used to contain other widgets.  In all
widget sets, special classes of widgets
manage the position
(and possibly the size) of the child widgets they contain.Composite widgets are an important part of any widget set, since
they insulate the application programmer from having to place
each widget individually, or from having to reposition or resize various
widgets when the application is resized by the user.
Composite widgets automatically adjust the layout of their
children when child widgets are added
or removed.
ID="IX-1013-2-8"widgetsremovingID="IX-1013-2-9"widgetsadding to parent listID="IX-1013-2-10"Shell widgetID="IX-1013-2-11"Shell widget; aboutShell widgets.  In any X Toolkit application, a special widget
called a Shell widget is created by the call to initialize the
Toolkit.  This widget is used as the parent of all other
application widgets (with the exception of popups, which receive
their own transient Shell widget as a parent), and includes
special functionality that allows it to interact with the window
manager.  The Shell widget is invisible, since it is
overlaid by the main widget of the application (typically a
composite widget), which is exactly the same size.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-1"ID="FN-1013-2-1"The Shell widget is actually a type of composite widget,
which is designed to
have only one managed child widget.  Its layout policy is extremely
simple.  It just makes its child widget exactly the same size as itself.A special-purpose application window.  Most applications have
at least one window that has unusual characteristics not
supported by an existing widget.  For example, in our
hypothetical application, the main application window is used to
graph the performance of a stock portfolio.ID="IX-1013-2-12"Core widgetaboutID="IX-1013-2-13"Core widget
There are several ways to implement such windows.  Which to use
depends on the complexity of what you plan to draw, the types
of input you want it to accept, and whether you know
how to write a widget.
You can add graphics to a DrawingArea widget.
You can add functionality to an existing widget (usually called
a Primitive widget) by adding actions as described in LINKEND="CH-1013-4-1""Chapter 4, An Example Application," or
you can write your own widget, as described in
LINKEND="CH-1013-6-1""Chapter 6, Inside a Widget."  As you will see, no matter how you write
application code to operate the special-purpose window,
making a widget that does the same thing is mostly a matter of
rearranging the code and changing variable names.  Placing code into
a widget gives you easier access to the configurability features of
Xt, and neatly packages up the code to operate the special window.A popup dialog box.ID="IX-1013-2-14"popupsabout
A popup is a widget that appears temporarily on the screen,
until the user provides a certain kind
of input.  Popups are usually invisible when the application starts up.
Using Xt, applications create popups very much like permanent widgets.
The only difference is that a special kind of Shell widget called a popup shell
needs to be created as the parent of the widget to be popped up.
Many types of menus and dialog boxes (also referred to as
"notices") are intended to be used as popups.There is one other element in the figure that is not strictly
part of the application, and is not provided by the widget set.
This is the titlebar, which is added to the application by
the window manager.  Typically, the titlebar displays the window
or application name, and also provides control areas for
moving, resizing and iconifying the application.While the titlebar isn't a widget, it is a window.  The window
manager adds the titlebar by "reparenting" the application.  That
is, it inserts another window between the application's toplevel
window and the root window.  The visible portion of this window
is the titlebar.The titlebar in the figure has been added by the twm window
manager, which is standard in X11 R5 from MIT. Clicking on the
small X logo in the left corner of the titlebar iconifies the
application; dragging the pointer in the nested box symbol in the
right corner resizes the window.  The window can be moved by
holding down the pointer anywhere else in the titlebar and dragging
the window to a new location.ID="S2-1013-2-1"About Widget SetsID="IX-1013-2-15"widgetssets; aboutShell widgets, and a few other base widget classes (Core,

set--a library of pre-built user-interface components.
Specifically, they are from the Athena widget set, developed at MIT.
ID="IX-1013-2-16"Athena widgetsaboutThe Athena widget set is distributed free along with the MIT X
Window System distribution, and as a result, is the basis for
many of the demonstration applications shipped by MIT and a great
deal of public-domain X software.
However, the Athena widget set was not intended to be
complete--it was built mainly for testing and demonstrating the
Intrinsics.  Furthermore, the Athena widgets do not have a particularly
attractive appearance nor user-interface conventions.  For these
reasons, we suggest that serious application development efforts
should begin with a commercial widget set.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-2"ID="FN-1013-2-2"The Athena widgets are described on reference pages in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual.ID="IX-1013-2-17"widgetssets; MotifID="IX-1013-2-18"widgetssets; OPEN LOOKID="IX-1013-2-19"widgetssets; aboutTwo commercial widget sets that are easily available and quite
complete are OSF's Motif and AT&T's OPEN LOOK widgets.
Both Motif and OPEN LOOK contain menus, scrollbars, command
buttons, dialog boxes, and a wide variety of composite widgets.
Both have an attractive appearance and consistent,
well defined user-interface conventions.  Each comes with a style guide
that contains suggestions for designing applications to blend in
well with other applications using that widget set.In order to highlight some of the added value provided by a
commercial widget set such as Motif,
LINKEND="FG-1013-02-2"Figure 2-2 shows the same
hypothetical application constructed with Motif widgets, and with
a titlebar provided by the mwm window manager.ID="FG-1013-02-2"A Motif widget-based application (simulated)FORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-2"As you can see, Motif has a distinctive appearance, using
shadowed outlines to simulate a 3-D appearance (buttons appear to
be pushed in when you click on them, and so forth).  What is more
important, Motif has conventions about the use of its widgets
that lead to a consistent look among all applications using
Motif.  The OSF/Motif Style Guide contains recommendations for
application design and layout, and whenever possible, these
recommendations are actually embodied in the design of the widget
set.  For example, the Motif MainWindow widget provides a
menubar at the top of the application, which can contain
titles for standard "pulldown" menus for file manipulation and
on-line help, as well as for various application functions.Motif also provides many more widgets than Athena, making it easy
to create control areas such as radio boxes (groups of buttons,
of which only one can be chosen at a time) or check boxes (groups
of buttons that may be set independently of each other, say for making
application configuration choices.)  There are also convenience
functions for creating many common combinations of widgets.The mwm window manager provides similar functions to twm,
but also always provides support for a help feature (invoked by
clicking on the box in the upper right corner of the titlebar).The Motif widgets also support some advanced features for
internationalization such as language-independent "compound
strings," keyboard traversal (moving around widgets with keyboard keys
rather than a mouse--this is very helpful for the design of
data-entry applications) and mnemonic key equivalents for
invoking menu commands.ID="IX-1013-2-20"Motif widgetsaboutID="IX-1013-2-21"widgetsabout
This book provides examples that use the Motif 1.2 widget set.
However, the techniques described in this book for
using, modifying, and creating widgets are defined by Xt, and
therefore are the same regardless of which widget set you use.
You can use the same techniques to create applications using
AT&T's OPEN LOOK widget set, or using the Athena widgets.Note, however, that Motif provides many Xt-level functions
(such as support for keyboard traversal and compound strings)
that go beyond those provided by Xt.
These features, are not portable to other widget sets.
If you plan to write an application that will be portable
between widget sets, you may wish to stay away from these
Motif-specific features.An important reminder here is that this is a book on the Xt Intrinsics,
not primarily on Motif.  Motif-specific features are
introduced, but not described in minute detail.
Moreover, Motif-specific features are carefully distinguished from
the basic Xt features, to make it is easier to know what features are
portable between widget sets.  (Motif-specific features are described
primarily in LINKEND="CH-1013-5-1""Chapter 5, More About Motif.")
Volume Six, X Toolkit Widget Reference Manual, provides a more complete description of how
to use each Motif widget, how to properly design an application
according to the Motif style guide, and how to use the Motif-specific
features and functions.ID="S2-1013-2-2"Widget Classes and InstancesID="IX-1013-2-22"classaboutID="IX-1013-2-23"instanceaboutA widget set defines classes of widgets.
DrawingArea is a class of widget, as are ArrowButton, PushButton,
ScrollBar, and the various widgets
shown in our hypothetical application.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-3"ID="FN-1013-2-3"The names of all Motif widget classes actually begin with Xm.
However, to make the text more readable,
we have omitted the Xm prefix when referring to these widgets,
except in examples and discussions of code where the prefix must
actually be used.
Each time you create a widget,
you create an instance of one of these
predefined classes.  For example, you might create several
PushButton widgets, each with a unique name, containing a unique
text label, and each invoking different application code when it
is clicked on.  All these widgets would be of class PushButton,
but they usually have different string names such as "quit",
"run", and "stop".
They would have similar characteristics, but they would not
necessarily look or act exactly the same since each could have been
configured differently.A widget class has certain fixed features which are common to all
instances of that class, and certain characteristics which can
be changed from one instance to the next.How you view a class depends on whether you are using existing
widget classes or are also writing new ones.
Eventually you will thoroughly understand both these views
of a class, since you will be competent in both using and writing widgets.
For the first four chapters of this book, we will
concentrate on the widget user's point of view.
Both views are introduced here because we don't want
to mislead you by telling you only the widget user's view, half the
story of what a class is.For a user of existing
widget classes (a widget set), a widget class is a black box
that has certain fixed
features and certain configurable features, both of which are
documented on the widget class's reference page.  You need not
know anything about how a class is implemented in Xt.  You know that
when you create an instance of that widget class, the instance will
have the documented fixed features and that you can set the configurable
features.  A user of existing widget classes is most interested in the
configurable features, since setting these is a big part of
programming an Xt application.  Each configurable feature is
called a resource.  Resources are more fully introduced in the
next section.If you are writing a widget class, or if you have written one and
see things from that perspective, a class seems slightly different.
To you, a widget class is a set of files in which the widget
class is implemented.  The widget class is no longer a black box--it
is an open box.  Knowing what widget class code looks like,
you know that its fixed features and its configurable features
are implemented in distinct sections of the code.
You know that each resource is actually represented by a field
in a structure.  You know that each class has a structure (the
class structure) that contains all the fixed features (both code and
data) of that class.
Even though you don't necessarily have access to the
source code for a widget class, your definition of a class is
based on how that class is implemented.ID="IX-1013-2-24"inheritanceaboutLINKEND="FG-1013-02-3"Figure 2-3  illustrates these two ways of viewing what a class is.ID="FG-1013-02-3"Two ways to think about a classFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-3"These two views of a class take on special relevance when looking
at a characteristic of the Toolkit called class inheritance.
Widget features and characteristics can be inherited from
other, more basic classes of widgets.  To a widget user, class
inheritance is important only because it means that the resources
(configurable features) of a widget class are defined not only by
the class itself but also by the classes from which the class inherits
features,
called its superclasses.  When you look up a widget class's
ID="IX-1013-2-25"superclassabout
features on its reference page, either all its superclass's resources
will be described, or you will have to look up its
superclass and look on that page also,
and continue up the class inheritance hierarchy to the most basic
widget, in order to get a complete list of its capabilities.
This sounds difficult, but in reality you get to know the features
of the most basic classes by heart, and the classes are not
deeply nested.From the widget writer's point of view, inheritance
means that a new class of widget needs to define only its own unique
features, and need not re-implement features common to all widgets, or
already implemented by an existing superclass.
All classes exist in a single-inheritance hierarchy that defines
which other classes each class inherits features.
(Note that the class hierarchy is completely different from the
parent-child relationship of widget instances you create in an
application.  The class hierarchy of a particular widget set
is fixed by the creators of the widget set, while the instance hierarchy
is different in every application, and is determined solely by the
writer of the application.  The instance hierarchy specifies
which widgets contain which other widgets on the screen.)ID="IX-1013-2-26"inheritanceamong Motif WidgetsID="IX-1013-2-27"Motif widgetsinheritance amongID="IX-1013-2-28"widgetsinheritance among (Motif)LINKEND="FG-1013-02-4"Figure 2-4 shows the class inheritance hierarchy for the Motif

clarify the concept of classing as implemented in the Toolkit.
A description and illustration of each of the Motif widgets is given
later in the book.ID="FG-1013-02-4"Class hierarchy of the Motif widget setFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-4"The Core widget class, defined by the Intrinsics, is the root of
the hierarchy, from which all other classes descend.
The Core class defines characteristics common to all widgets,
such as size and position.ID="IX-1013-2-29"Primitive widgetThe Motif Primitive widget class inherits basic widget features from
Core and adds a few minor features of its own (for example, control
of Motif style 3-D shadows) that are common to many
Motif widgets.
ID="IX-1013-2-30"Label widget
The Label widget in turn adds the ability to display a string or
a pixmap, and adds
mechanisms for changing the font and placement of the string.
ID="IX-1013-2-31"PushButton widget
PushButton then inherits features from Label (including those already
inherited from Core and Primitive) and adds more
features, such as the ability to accept user input and highlight
the button.
ID="IX-1013-2-32"subclass
PushButton is known as a subclass of Label, and Label is the
superclass of PushButton.  In general, lower classes in the
hierarchy have more features.
ID="IX-1013-2-33"Core widgetaboutID="IX-1013-2-34"composite widgetsComposite widgetID="IX-1013-2-35"constraint widgets
The Composite class adds geometry-management capabilities to the
basic characteristics defined by Core.
Constraint is a further refinement of Composite that allows the
application or the user to supply instructions on how the size
and position of each child should be managed.
ID="IX-1013-2-36"Manager widget
All Motif geometry-managing widgets are subclasses of Manager,
which is itself a subclass of Constraint.  Manager is Motif's
equivalent of Primitive for geometry-managing widgets--it
adds features such as 3-D shadows so that they are available in
virtually all Motif widgets.ID="IX-1013-2-37"Shell widgetShell is a special class
of Composite widget designed for interaction with the window
manager.New widgets can be subclassed by the widget programmer
directly from Core, Composite, or
Constraint, or can be subclassed from an existing widget in any
widget set that has some of the desired behavior.
For example, it is easy to imagine creating a subclass of Primitive
in order to develop a custom graphics window.As long as appropriate widget classes are available, the
application programmer needs to know little or nothing about widget
internals.  In fact, even if widget internals are known, it is unwise
to depend on them.  Widgets should be treated as black boxes with
documented inputs and outputs.  If only these documented interfaces
are used, the widget internals can be modified without affecting the
application, and the application can be modified without affecting
the widget.ID="S2-1013-2-3"Widget Configurability with ResourcesTo serve their purpose as reusable user-interface
components, widgets must be highly configurable.
For example, an application programmer must be able
to define not only a separate label for each PushButton
widget, but also the application function that is invoked when
the button is clicked.  The programmer will also want to let the user
define additional attributes such as font and color.ID="IX-1013-2-38"resourcesaboutTo support this degree of configurability,
widget classes can declare variables as named
resources of the widget.
The application can pass the value of widget resources
as arguments to the call to create a widget instance, or can set
them after creation using the Intrinsics call XtSetValues().
Even before that, though, as an application starts up, a
part of Xlib called the resource manager reads
configuration settings placed in a series of ASCII
files by the user and/or the application developer, and
Xt automatically uses this information to configure the
widgets in the application.  The collection of resource
name/value pairs contained in the various resource files and set
directly by the application is collectively referred to as the
resource database.LINKEND="FG-1013-02-5"Figure 2-5  shows several Label widgets configured with different resource
settings, to show you how radically the appearance of even such
a simple widget can be altered.  Note that a widget's input
characteristics can also be configured (although the Label class has
no input characteristics to configure).ID="FG-1013-02-5"Several Athena Label widgets configured using resourcesFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.05.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-5"The resource manager provides a flexible mechanism for
generalizing the behavior of widgets.  The application developer
can "hardcode" the value of those resources that must not be changed
because they could cripple the application (as when changing the
label of the Quit widget to Save), and can establish
reasonable defaults for other resources, so that the user can
configure all nonessential aspects of an application's look and feel.Note that the term "resource" is used somewhat ambiguously in X.
First, in the original documentation for Xlib and the X Protocol,
various data structures that are maintained by the server and
identified to clients only by an integer ID are referred to as resources.
These data structures include windows, colormaps, fonts, and so forth.
In this series, these are normally called server resources where
there is possible confusion.ID="IX-1013-2-39"resourcesserver resourcesID="IX-1013-2-40"XtSetValuesID="IX-1013-2-41"XtGetValues
Second, the term is commonly used to refer both to a widget variable
publicly declared as a widget resource, and to the
name/value pairs in the resource database.  In this book, we will
use the term resource to refer to the actual variable and its
current value in a widget instance, and the term resource
setting to refer to a name/value pair in the database.
ID="IX-1013-2-42"resourcessetting; about
The two are closely related, but may not be identical.
For example, separate settings for the same resource may be
requested in an app-defaults file and in an individual's
user-preference file.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-5"ID="FN-1013-2-5"There are several possible sources of resource settings.
If two or more contain resource settings for the same resource
of the same widget,
which will actually take effect is determined by rules of
precedence that are described (along with the various sources of
resource settings) in LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion."
Furthermore, the value of a resource may be
set on the fly by a call to XtSetValues(), but this
value is never saved in the resource database.  (This value can
be retrieved from within a widget or application by a call to
XtGetValues().)ID="S2-1013-2-4"Widget IndependenceEach widget operates, to a large degree, independently of the
application.  Xt dispatches events to a widget, which performs the
appropriate actions according to the design of its class, without
application help.  For example, widgets redraw themselves automatically
when they become exposed after being covered by another window.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-6"ID="FN-1013-2-6"ID="IX-1013-2-43"redrawing windowsID="IX-1013-2-44"exposeExpose eventsID="IX-1013-2-45"eventsExpose
Redrawing is necessary because the contents of X windows
are maintained by the X server only while they are visible.
When one window is obscured by another, the
contents of the obscured area of one of the windows is lost and must
be redrawn when it later becomes exposed.  X clients are responsible
for redrawing the contents of their windows when this happens.
Fortunately, Xt automatically redraws correctly written widgets at
the appropriate times so that your application doesn't have to worry
about this.
Widgets also handle the consequences when the values of their
resources are changed.
An instance of Label, for example, does not depend on the application
that created it to determine its size.  By default, Label will choose
a size large enough to accommodate the current string in the current
font.  If the application changes the text or font in the Label widget with
a call to XtSetValues(),
the Label widget itself will attempt to keep its own window large
enough to accommodate the current string.  (Of course, if necessary, the application
can also explicitly choose the Label widget's size.)
When the application tells a Label
widget what font to display its string in, the widget knows how to
load a new font, recalculate its own size, and redraw its string--the
application doesn't have to micro-manage any of this.  The application
simply sets the font resource of the widget, and the widget does the
rest.LINKEND="FG-1013-02-6"Figure 2-6  and LINKEND="FG-1013-02-7"Figure 2-7 illustrate how a widget operates independently of the application
and how XtSetValues() lets the application set how a widget
operates itself.ID="FG-1013-02-6"Widgets operate independently of the applicationFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.06.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-6"ID="FG-1013-02-7"XtSetValues lets the application set how a widget will operate itselfFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.07.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-7"ID="S2-1013-2-5"Widget-Application InteractionIn the other direction, widgets are designed to let the user
control the application.  Therefore, widgets have the ability to
invoke certain sections of application code--sections of the
application's own choosing.  Again, widgets will operate fine
without invoking any application code,
but if they don't invoke any, they won't do anything for the user.One way that the application arranges for widgets to
invoke application code is by registering application functions
with Xt.  Once the application is running, Xt will call these
functions in response to some occurrence in the widget.
For example, a PushButton widget usually invokes an application function
when the user clicks on the widget.  (Thus, the widget
labeled "Quit" might invoke the code that checks whether data has been
saved, and if so, exits the application.)
Or the ScrollBar widget notifies the application when the user has
moved the thumb, by calling a function that the application has
registered with the widget for that purpose.
LINKEND="FG-1013-02-8"Figure 2-8 and
LINKEND="FG-1013-02-9"Figure 2-9 illustrate how an application registers a function during the
startup phase, and how Xt then calls the function during the event-loop
phase in response to a particular occurrence in the widget.ID="FG-1013-02-8"Application registers a function with Xt during startup phaseFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.08.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-8"There are three separate mechanisms that can be used to link
widgets and application functions:  callbacks, actions, and event
handlers.ID="IX-1013-2-46"callbacksaboutGenerally speaking, a widget expecting to interact with an
application will declare one or more callback lists as resources;
the application adds functions to these callback lists, which will
be invoked whenever the predefined callback conditions are met.
Callback lists are resources, so that the application can set or
change the function that will be invoked.Callbacks are not necessarily invoked in response to any event; a
widget can call the specified routines at any arbitrary point in
its code, whenever it wants to provide a "hook" for application
interaction.
For example, all widgets provide a
destroyCallback resource to allow applications to
provide a routine to be executed when the widget is
destroyed.
ID="IX-1013-2-47"reasonin callbacksID="IX-1013-2-48" SPAN="START"callbacksreasons
All callbacks have what Motif calls a reason--a
well-defined occurrence of some kind that causes the callback to be
triggered.
ID="IX-1013-2-49"widgetsdestroyingID="FG-1013-02-9"Xt calls the function during the event-loop phase in response to an occurrenceFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.09.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-9"Although a callback reason need not be an event, callbacks are often
invoked by widgets from within actions, which are event-driven.
ID="IX-1013-2-50" SPAN="END"callbacksreasonsID="IX-1013-2-51"actionsaboutID="IX-1013-2-52"translationsabout
Action routines are called directly by Xt in
response to events specified in a translation table.
Xt supports a high-level event-specification
syntax, which allows easy specification of complicated event
sequences (such as double- or triple-clicks, or key- and
button-press combinations) as the trigger for actions.
Furthermore, the translation table is a resource, allowing
the application developer or the user to configure the events
that will invoke a given widget action.Actions are usually internal to the widget and require no interaction
with the application.
(For example, in the Text widget, all editing operations
are carried out entirely by the widget, using functions defined
as actions.  The only role required of the application is to read
and write files.)
However, an application can also add actions to a widget, which
can function in much the same way as callbacks, but without the
widget class having made provision for them.The purpose of a well-designed widget set is to
implement a particular user interface, which provides conventions
designed to make all applications operate in the same way.  A
widget's callbacks are often designed to support the intended use of
the widget, while adding actions to a widget can make it behave in
ways the designer did not foresee and that the user might not expect.
Nonetheless, there are cases in which the best way to implement the
desired behavior is to add actions to an existing widget.ID="IX-1013-2-53"event handlersaboutIn addition to callbacks and actions, it is also possible for an
application (or a widget) to implement event handlers, which
use an event-selection mechanism similar to that used in Xlib.
Event handlers are rarely used by application programmers,
since actions are simpler and configurable without recompiling.Some widgets also declare public routines, which can be used by
an application to control aspects of the widget's behavior or to get
widget data.  Usually, the purpose of public routines is to
provide a more convenient means for setting or getting widget
data that would otherwise have to be accessed through resources.ID="S2-1013-2-6"Xt and Object-oriented Programming (OOP)ID="IX-1013-2-54"objectsobject-oriented programmingID="IX-1013-2-55"OOP (see objectsobject-oriented programmingXt provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style,
where the objects are widgets.  However, since Xt is written in
C, a language that provides no special support for
OOP, Xt depends on programming conventions and programmer
discipline to maintain the semblance of objects.  It is
very important that the programmer understand the goals and
rules of OOP, because the language and the system won't enforce these
rules, and if you don't follow them, you won't get the benefits.
If you are familiar with another object-oriented system, you will
need to understand Xt's particular implementation of OOP.
On the other hand, if Xt is your first exposure to
OOP, an explanation of its goals and concepts should make
the whole system make a lot more sense.Traditionally, object-oriented programming is defined in terms of
the five words object, method, message, class,
and instance, and the concept of encapsulation.
We've already talked about classes and instances.  This section
describes the remainder of these terms.ID="S3-1013-2-1"The ObjectID="IX-1013-2-56"objectsaboutIn OOP, an object contains two elements:  the data that represents a
state, and code that reads or writes that data (called
methods) and performs some action based on it.  For example, the
string displayed by a Label widget
ID="IX-1013-2-57"Label widget
is part of
its state data, and the code that actually draws the string on the
window is a method that
reads the state data and draws based on it.  Inside widget code, the
state data is
represented as structure members, and the methods are represented as
pointers to functions.  Some state data members are public; they are
resources that can be set or retrieved from outside the object.
Other state data members are private; they cannot be read or written
from outside, but they help the widget keep its own house in order.ID="S3-1013-2-2"MethodsID="IX-1013-2-58"methodsin OOPWhat is called a method in traditional OOP is either a method
or an action in Xt.  In Xt, methods are a set of functions that
are fixed for a particular class, triggered in fixed ways usually
in response to Xt function calls made by the application (with
one special case, the
ID="IX-1013-2-59"methodsexposeexpose method, triggered directly by the
Expose event).   A widget's methods supply its most
basic functions, such as the code needed to create a
window, or to redraw itself.  Actions, on the other hand, are
called in response to the events specified in a translation
table, and thus the events that trigger actions are user
configurable.  Actions supply most of the
features of widgets, and these features can be added to or replaced
by the application, as demonstrated in 
LINKEND="S1-1013-4-2"Section 4.2, "xbitmap2:  Adding Graphics to Display the Bitmap" and LINKEND="S1-1013-4-4"Section 4.4, "xbitmap4:  A Bitmap Editor Without a BitmapEdit Widget."ID="IX-1013-2-60"methodsvs. actionsID="IX-1013-2-61"actionsvs. methodsFrom the widget writer's point of view, each method is just a
function whose pointer has a place in the class structure.  Each
method has particular responsibilities in managing the basic
functions necessary for a widget to be a widget.  For example, every
widget class must have a method that responds to calls to
XtSetValues().  What each of
the vital methods must do is described in LINKEND="CH-1013-7-1""Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods." Each method has different arguments and returned values.Every action, on the other hand, has the same set of arguments.
Actions generally perform the features of
the widget that are triggered by events.
You could say that actions are the widget's occupation:
it needs them to do anything useful but not to exist.ID="S3-1013-2-3"MessagesID="IX-1013-2-62"messagesaboutID="IX-1013-2-63"messagesOOP vs. XtIn pure OOP, input to objects and communication between them are
called messages.  In Xt, however, the forms
of communication are function calls, events, actions, and callbacks.
As you have seen, applications can communicate with widgets using
function calls, such as to set or get widget resources
using XtSetValues() and XtGetValues().  Widgets also
respond directly to events from the user.  Widgets contact the
application when certain things occur using callbacks or actions.
Widgets pass data back and forth using special
kinds of events.  All these types of communication can be thought of
as forms of messages.
ID="IX-1013-2-64"objectsobject-oriented programmingID="S3-1013-2-4"EncapsulationID="IX-1013-2-65"encapsulationObjects are intended to be black boxes with documented inputs and
outputs. In other words, a program that uses an object must not
depend on the internal implementation of the object, but instead only
on the known inputs and outputs.  This is called code encapsulation.
The advantages of code encapsulation are that programmers can use
the object without needing to understand its internal implementation
(hiding details), and that the internal implementation of the object
can be changed at any time because no other code depends on it.
This can be stated in another way:  it minimizes interdependencies.
In large software projects, this one feature makes OOP worthwhile.This encapsulation is very effective in Xt.  You should be able to
get a long way toward completing an application without even needing
to know what the code inside a widget looks like, let alone the details
that implement a particular widget.  For that reason, in this book
we don't show you what is inside a widget until
LINKEND="CH-1013-6-1""Chapter 6, Inside a Widget." Even when you do know how widgets are implemented, it
is a good idea to "forget" while writing application code, so
that you are not tempted to depend on implementation details.Each widget class has a public include file and a private include
file.  The application includes just the public include file,
while the actual widget code includes the private (which happens also
to include the public).  The names of both include files are
based on the class
name of the widget, but the private
include file adds the letter P to the end.  For example,
the Label widget's public include file is Label.h, while its
ID="IX-1013-2-66"Label widgetLabel.h file
private include file is LabelP.h.  Application code should
include only the public include file, to maintain the desired
encapsulation.  It is tempting for beginning Xt programmers to
include the private include file, because it allows you to take
shortcuts, but you should resist the temptation.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-7"ID="FN-1013-2-7"In a language

exactly what it does is described in Chapter 14.Initialize the Toolkit with

two functions do exactly the same thing but have slightly different
argument styles.  The difference is described in LINKEND="S2-1013-2-12"Section 2.5.1, "Setting and Getting Resources from the Application."  Many
other Xt functions also have two versions with and without "Va" in
their names.  In the future, unless specifically stated otherwise, you
can assume that when a sentence mentions one version it also applies to
the other.)

Create widgets and tell their composite parent widget about them.
This requires one call to XtVaCreateManagedWidget()

(Separate XtVaCreateWidget() and XtManageChildren() calls
can also be used to speed startup of applications with many widgets.)
In Motif, there are also individual functions for creating many
individual widgets and combinations of widgets.
We use these "convenience functions" only
for combinations of widgets, since XtVaCreateManagedWidget() is
more general, more concise, and no more difficult to use.ID="IX-1013-2-83"callbacksaboutID="IX-1013-2-84"actionsaboutID="IX-1013-2-85"event handlers

This step actually creates the windows for widgets and maps
them on the screen.  This step is separate from
creating the widgets themselves, because it allows all
interdependent widgets to work out their relative size and
position before any windows are created.  (For more on

ID="IX-1013-2-87"main loopID="IX-1013-2-88"eventsevent loopmain loopBegin the loop processing events by calling XtAppMainLoop().  At this point,
Xt takes control of your application and operates the widgets.  If any widgets
are to call functions in your application, you must have registered
these functions with Xt before calling XtAppMainLoop.ID="IX-1013-2-89"XtAppMainLoopThe four steps (3 through 6 above) of initializing the Toolkit, creating widgets, registering
application functions with Xt,
and realizing widgets, comprise the setup phase of the application.
Your application should do as much of its work as possible in this
phase, before calling XtAppMainLoop(), in order to speed up the second
phase of the application (which is the event loop).  This policy improves the
response time to user events.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-8"ID="FN-1013-2-8"In X Protocol terms, the setup phase consists of requests to the server that
are generally long, and often require immediate replies, which tends
to slow performance.
ID="IX-1013-2-90"round trip request
The event loop phase, on the other hand, generally consists of short requests
and very few "round-trip" requests.  For a full description
of this concept, see the introductory chapter to Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.
As we will see in LINKEND="CH-1013-6-1""Chapter 6, Inside a Widget," this policy also applies

more than meets the eye:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-2-95"XtVaAppInitializeXtVaAppInitialize() performs several important tasks.
It reads the resource databases and merges in any command-line
arguments so that Xt can use this information to configure widgets as
they are created.
It also opens a connection to the server, and creates a Shell
widget that is designed to interact with
the window manager and to be the parent for other widgets created in the
application.
ID="IX-1013-2-96"Shell widget; aboutID="IX-1013-2-97"top-levelwidget Shell widgetThe first argument to XtVaAppInitialize() passes the
address of an XtAppContext.  An XtAppContext is
an opaque pointer to a large structure in which Xt will manage all the
data associated with the application. The only use of the
XtAppContext returned from XtVaAppInitialize() in a
typical application is to pass it to XtAppMainLoop() and
possibly a few other functions.  The true
purpose for the XtAppContext being a public variable is
complicated and is discussed later.The second argument (a string) is the class name of the application.
It is the string that can be used in resource files to
set resources for this application, and it is also the name of
the app-defaults file, in which the application writer
establishes default resource settings for the application.

By convention, the class name is
the same name as the application name (the string typed to
invoke the application), except with the first letter
capitalized, or if the application name begins with X, the first
two letters capitalized.  For the current application, the class
name is XHello since the application name is xhello.The remaining arguments have special purposes that are not used
in this application.  We will introduce them briefly here but reserve
complete treatment of them for LINKEND="CH-1013-3-1""Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets." The third and fourth arguments are a pointer to and length of an
array of
application-specific command-line arguments that you can define.
The fifth and sixth arguments are the common argc and
argv--which XtVaAppInitialize() parses for a variety of
standard X Toolkit options and the ones you defined in the previous
arguments.  The seventh argument
is where you specify fallback resource settings in case the app-defaults
file is not installed properly.  The final argument terminates a
variable-length argument list which can be used to customize the
Shell widget with resources: this application uses the default
Shell widget and therefore provides no resource settings in the list.The Shell widget returned by the call to XtVaAppInitialize() is
used as the parent of the first widget created in the application.
ID="IX-1013-2-102"XtVaAppInitializeargumentsID="IX-1013-2-103"XtVaCreateManagedWidgetThe XtVaCreateManagedWidget() call both creates the Label widget
and tells the parent (the Shell widget) that the Label widget's
geometry is to be
managed.  It is also possible to call XtVaCreateWidget() and
either XtManageChild() or XtManageChildren() separately, but
this is usually done only if you want to create many children of
a single widget, then put them all under parental management at once.
ID="IX-1013-2-104"XtManageChildID="IX-1013-2-105"XtManageChildrenXtVaCreateManagedWidget() is used for creating
any class of widget.  The first argument is the instance name,
a string which Xt uses to look up settings in the resource database.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-9"ID="FN-1013-2-9"ID="IX-1013-2-106"instance names~requirements forThe instance names for widgets need not be unique.  However, if
they are not unique then resources can only be set on all widgets
with the same name at once.  Instance names can also be "", but then
resources cannot be set at all.  Instance names that include a
period cannot be set from resource files.
The second argument specifies the
class of widget to create--this variable comes from the header file for
that widget, and should always be found on the reference page for a widget.
The third argument is the parent, which in this case is the Shell
widget returned by XtVaAppInitialize(), but in a more complex
example could be a composite widget deeper in a hierarchy of nested
widgets.  The fourth argument terminates a varargs list, unused in
this example, that is for hardcoding widget resources.  (More on varargs
lists later.)ID="IX-1013-2-107"widgetsas data typesNotice that XtVaCreateManagedWidget() and XtVaAppInitialize()
each return a value of type Widget.
This type is an opaque pointer that is used to refer to a widget
instance.  It is used anywhere in the application that you need to
refer to a particular widget.  We sometimes refer to this as a widget
ID, since even though it is a pointer to a structure, the
individual fields in that structure should never be accessed from
the application, so it can be treated just as a unique number.ID="IX-1013-2-108"XtRealizeWidgetThe steps of initializing the Toolkit and creating widgets
seem logical.  However, what does it mean to realize a widget?
XtRealizeWidget() actually makes
windows for the widgets, whereas creating the widgets
simply creates and initializes various internal widget data
structures.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-10"ID="FN-1013-2-10"A widget is a client-side object.  It has no presence on the
server other than as a normal X window.  The Xt and widget set
libraries running on the client side maintain the data that allow
programs to work with the abstraction perceived as a widget.ID="IX-1013-2-109"realizationID="IX-1013-2-110"geometry managementabout
Creation and realization of widgets are separate because some window
geometries cannot be known until all the widgets are created and the
composite widgets have determined their geometries.  The realization
step says "OK, all the widgets are created now; calculate their sizes
and positions and make windows for them."However, note that it is acceptable
to create additional widgets after calling XtRealizeWidget() as
long as there is a good reason to do so (for example, when it cannot
be known whether the
widget would be needed until a certain user event arrives).ID="IX-1013-2-111"menusaboutID="IX-1013-2-112"widgetsmapping; windows
The realization step also maps all the widget windows.  Mapping is an
X concept, not something added by Xt.  Mapping a window makes it
eligible for display.  For a window to actually become visible, all
its ancestors must be mapped.  Since XtRealizeWidget() is
called for the widget created by XtVaAppInitialize(), which is
the ancestor of all widgets in the application, the end result is
that the entire application is displayed.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-11"ID="FN-1013-2-11"There are several other conditions that can prevent or delay a window from
becoming visible, 
described in ENDTERM="XLib_PG" LINKEND="S2-1002-2-9"Section 2.2.4, "Mapping and Visibility" of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.  These will not affect your Toolkit application as long as you draw into windows at the right times, using one of the techniques described in LINKEND="S1-1013-4-2"Section 4.2, "xbitmap2: Adding Graphics to Display the Bitmap" and LINKEND="S1-1013-7-3"Section 7.3, "The expose Method."ID="IX-1013-2-113"main loopID="IX-1013-2-114"XtAppMainLoopXtAppMainLoop() transfers control of the application to Xt.
From this point on, Xt drives all the
widgets in response to events, and it interacts with the application
only at times the application has arranged ahead of time.
xhello did not arrange any interaction with the widget, so Xt
operates the Label widget without returning to xhello's code.
LINKEND="EX-1013-02-3"Example 2-3 demonstrates how to make such arrangements.Xt programming is event-driven.  XtAppMainLoop() dispatches events
to widgets and functions in the order in which they occur.  These events
can be caused by user actions such as pressing a key or by window system
actions such as displaying a new window.  This is fundamentally
different from procedural programming, where the application is in
charge and polls for user input at certain points.ID="S2-1013-2-8"Compiling the ApplicationID="IX-1013-2-115"commandcommand line; compilingID="IX-1013-2-116"compiling XtID="IX-1013-2-117"sourceobtaining source codeID="IX-1013-2-118"anonymous ftpID="IX-1013-2-119"ftpID="IX-1013-2-120"uunetID="IX-1013-2-121"expo.lcs.mit.eduYou can get the code for xhello.c and all the rest of the
examples in this book via uucp or anonymous ftp, as
described in the Preface.
It is a good idea to compile and run each example as it is presented.The example programs come with Imakefiles that should make building
them easy if you have the imake program (which should already
be in /usr/bin/X11 on UNIX-based systems that have X11 Release 4
installed), and you need the configuration files, in
/usr/lib/X11/config on most UNIX-based systems.
The source for imake and the configuration files are also in
the X11R4 distribution from MIT (see LINKEND="AX-1013-F-1""Appendix F, Sources of Additional Information" for how to get this
distribution).An Imakefile is a
system-independent makefile that is used by
imake to generate a Makefile.  This is necessary because it
is impossible to write a Makefile that will work on all systems.
You invoke imake using the xmkmf program (also in
/usr/bin/X11 and on the R4 distribution).
Complete instructions for compiling the
examples using imake are provided in a README file in the
example source.
Note that the examples are designed to work with Motif 1.1, and
probably will not work with Motif 1.0.To compile any of the examples on a UNIX system without using
imake, use the following command line:ID="SC-1013-2-1"cc -O -o filenamefilename.c -lXm -lXt -lX11If you want to do debugging, replace -O with -g in this command line.

The order of the libraries is important.  Xm relies on
Xt, and both Xm and Xt rely on Xlib

several sources, including a user's resource file, the
command line, or an application-specific defaults file.ID="SB-1013-2-1"Is the X Toolkit Too Complex?An editorial asideWindow systems may be simple to use, but they are very complex
to program.
The first thing that strikes the novice X programmer is how complicated
everything is.  Learning to program the X Window System, even with
the help of the X Toolkit, is a far cry from learning say, the
C programming language, where the very first page of the tutorial
presents a complete running program.  The program itself is
trivial, but this, the "hello world" program, has become a
tacit benchmark of programmability.  The assumption is "if you can't
write `hello world' simply, things are badly designed."In fact, "hello, world" is a pathological example for X; it is a case where
the stylized scaffolding outweighs the functional code.
You've just seen an X Toolkit equivalent to "hello world,"and it is nearly thirty lines long.
But it is node-independent, does device-independent
graphics, and can be customized by the user
to control what font to use, and what color
to use for the border, background, and text.The "hello world" example is indeed a good benchmark of
language complexity, but it is not necessarily a good general
benchmark for overall programming complexity.  It is an especially poor measure
for a system that encompasses a generalized distributed software
environment, network communication, and device-independent graphics.
Most people write complicated applications, not trivial programs like
"hello, world," and it is the ease with which a complicated program
can be written that is the true test of a language.For example, consider the difference
in the number of lines of code between "hello world" and a
text editor.  Kernighan & Ritchie's C Programming Language, where
"hello world" was first introduced, doesn't present an editor.
However, Kernighan and Plaugher's Software Tools,
an equally sacred reference from the same era,
presents a text editor that contains
well over one thousand lines.  Furthermore, the editor
is line-oriented, not screen-oriented.  By comparison,
because of the modular design of the Toolkit, and the development of
widgets as reusable user-interface components,
a programmer can construct a simple screen editor using the Motif Text
widget in about 170 lines of code.  This editor is
user-configurable, device-independent, and based on a ready-made
component that can easily be incorporated into any program needing to
provide text-editing capabilities.This is not to invite absurd comparisons of
incommensurate programming tools, but to emphasize that
the complexity of X is the outgrowth of added functionality, not
unnecessary convolutions of straightforward algorithms.
What really matters is what features are provided, how
difficult is it to write the kind of application you want to write,
and what performance can be achieved. --Mark LangleyEach resource of a widget has a default value determined by the widget
class that declared the resource.  However, in many cases,
the application wants a different
default value, but still wants the user to be able to change the
value of that resource.
ID="IX-1013-2-130"Motif widgetsLabel widgetThe Label widget is a case in point.
LINKEND="EX-1013-02-1"Example 2-1 (xhello) sets the default string displayed
in the Label widget, "hello," by naming the widget hello in the call to
XtVaCreateManagedWidget().  It just so happens that
the Label widget uses its widget name as the string to be displayed
if no other string has been specified in the resource database.
However, this trick doesn't exist for
the other resources of Label or of other widgets.The application can provide a default value for resources by
hardcoding them in the application source file using the fallback
resources argument of XtAppInitialize().
However, changing these settings would require recompiling the source.
Xt provides a better way.ID="IX-1013-2-131"app-defaults filedirectoryID="IX-1013-2-132"app-defaults filenaming conventionsID="IX-1013-2-133"conventionsapp-defaults file
To provide defaults, applications should always create an
"app-defaults" resource file, which on UNIX systems
is usually stored in the
directory /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-12"ID="FN-1013-2-12"On Sun systems under OpenWindows the default location for the
app-defaults files is the /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults directory.
On all systems Xt provides a mechanism that allows you to provide a
different app-defaults file for each language.  This will
be described in LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion."
For any application, the name of this file should be the same as the
classname argument to XtVaAppInitialize().
By convention, this string
is the same as the name of the application, with the first letter
capitalized.  If the application name begins with X, the first
two letters should be capitalized.
For xhello this is XHello.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-13"ID="FN-1013-2-13"Note that existing
applications do not always follow this latter convention.  For example,
the app-defaults file for xmh is called
Xmh, not XMh.LINKEND="EX-1013-02-2"Example 2-2  shows the contents of the app-defaults file

should not be quoted.  White space after the colon is ignored.All resource settings in app-defaults files should start
with an asterisk, instead of specifying the application name or class
(xhello or XHello).  This is important as it allows the user to
easily override this setting, for reasons described in Chapter 10
in the discussion of the ? wildcard.ID="IX-1013-2-134"resourcesspecifications; formatThe app-defaults file has the same format as all other
resource database files.
In brief, there are two types of resources:  application
resources and widget resources.  (You already know about widget
resources.  Application resources are the same except that they
apply to the application code instead of to individual widgets.
Application resources are defined by the application writer--how to
do this is described in LINKEND="CH-1013-3-1""Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets.")The syntax for specifying application resources in a resource file is
simple:application_name.resource_name: valueWidget resources are more complicated since there may be
multiple instances of the same widget class in an application.  As a
result, you must specify the name not only of the widget, but a
pathname starting with the application name and containing the
name of each widget in the widget hierarchy leading to the
desired widget.  For example,
in the application xhello,
the complete resource specification for the
resource called label for the Label widget called hello
would be:ID="SC-1013-2-2"xhello.hello.labelString:  Hello, World!The xhello refers to the widget created by XtVaAppInitialize(),
and hello is its child created by
XtVaCreateManagedWidget().
One possible source of confusion is that the shell widget
instance returned by XtVaAppInitialize() is not named
xhello by the arguments of that call (no instance name string
is specified there at all--only its class name string
XHello).
Its instance name is the same as the name of the
application (specified on the command line): xhello.ID="IX-1013-2-135"wildcardsin resource specificationsTo simplify resource specifications, a wildcard syntax may be
used, specifying an asterisk instead of a dot, and omitting one
or more terms of the fully qualified name.  For example, as we've
shown above:ID="SC-1013-2-3"*hello.labelString:  Hello, World!or since there is no other Label widget in the application, even:ID="SC-1013-2-4"*labelString:  Hello, World!If you specify a widget correctly and the resource name correctly,
but provide an illegal value, the
widget should display an error message: the Motif widget set is fairly
thorough about this.  But the
resource manager (the part of Xlib that processes resource
specifications) silently ignores
resource specification errors of any kind,
so they can be difficult to track down.
The kinds of errors that are not reported include:MARK="BULLET"Misspelling any widget name or resource name.Leaving out a level in the hierarchy when using the . (period) binding.Setting a resource on a widget that doesn't exist.Setting a resource that doesn't exist for the widget.ID="IX-1013-2-136"resourcesspecifications; errors inYou should also be aware that widget classes can be used in
resource specifications.  For example, instead of setting the
foreground resource of each PushButton widget one at a time
using their widget instance names, they can all be set with one
line using the widget class name in place of the instance name:ID="SC-1013-2-5"*XmPushButton.foreground:  blueBecause widget instance names take precedence over class
names, however, one can override a
class setting with a specific resource setting, by using a name
for an individual widget instance.  Therefore, you can set

Note that all resource specifications in files are given as strings,
even though the data required for the resource may be of a different
type.  Xt automatically converts the string found in the resource
database files into the appropriate destination type.  For example,
colors are specified as color names, which
are automatically converted to the pixel values that are required for
drawing.  These
converters are normally defined by Xt or the widget class.ID="IX-1013-2-139"resourcessymbolic constantsID="IX-1013-2-140"XmN constants
Note also that in resource files, you and users specify the
resource name as shown above.  But in any Xt calls from
source code, you always use symbolic constants of the form
XmNresourceName (e.g., XmNforeground).
(Standard Xt, as used for example with the Athena widget set,
uses symbolic constants that begin with XtN instead.)
Resource names are actually strings, and it improves compile-time
checking to use symbolic constants instead of typing the string in
directly.The complete list of sources for resource database settings,
the precedence rules used for establishing the actual resource value
when there are conflicting settings in different database sources,
and the mechanics of type conversion,
are all described in detail in
LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion." (See also Chapter 10, Setting Resources, in Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide.)  We'll also be returning to the
topic of resources with each new example.

application are, as the name suggests, only defaults.  The user
can place similar settings in a separate resource file, and these user settings
override your app-defaults settings.  This allows the user to
customize the application.There are pros and cons to applications that can be radically
customized by the user through resources.  The pros are quite clear:MARK="BULLET"A flexible application will meet the needs of a wider audience.Users will have a wide variety of systems on which different
colors and fonts will look best.Users may have a special job in mind for which the application can
be customized.Some of the cons are that:MARK="BULLET"A user may make a mistake in the configuration that makes the
application inoperable in some way.Documentation and technical support become more difficult.A partial solution is to document the default resource specifications
and require that users reinstall those default specifications before a
technical support person tries to solve their problems.  In some cases,
dialog boxes can be added that require the user to confirm any
irreversible actions.In any case, you may eventually want to hardcode certain resources in
the application so that they are not user-configurable.  This would be
done for resources that, if set incorrectly, would make your
application operate in an unsafe fashion.
Hardcoding a widget resource is done by placing the resource
name and the desired value in the final arguments to
XtVaCreateManagedWidget() or XtCreateManagedWidget().This technique is demonstrated later, because you won't need it until
the later stages of developing your application.
While an application is under development, it is better to leave as many
resources as possible configurable from resource files,
because this allows you
to change them in the app-defaults file without recompiling
the source.LINKEND="FN-1013-2-14"ID="FN-1013-2-14"There are a few resources in Motif that currently cannot be set from
resource files.  OSF may correct this in later releases.
When the code is stable and
almost ready for release, then it's time to determine which resources
need to be hardcoded, and then to hardcode them.ID="S1-1013-2-4"Connecting Widgets to Application CodeThe Toolkit is designed so that the code that implements the user
interface and
the code that implements application features can be kept separate.
This is an advantage, because it allows either part to be
modified without affecting
the other.  However, these two pieces of code need to be
intimately connected, because the user interface must drive
the application code.This section describes how to make this connection
using callbacks.  As mentioned earlier, the general idea is
that the application registers functions to be called later by Xt
in response to occurrences within certain widgets.Callbacks are the method used when taking advantage of
features of existing widgets.  There are other methods, using
actions in combination with translations or event handlers, but
they are used primarily when adding functionality to widgets.  The main
purpose of actions is to modularize the code within a widget that
responds to events.  The use of actions in the application will be
demonstrated in LINKEND="CH-1013-4-1"Chapter 4, "An Example Application" and in widget code in LINKEND="CH-1013-6-1"Chapter 6, "Inside a Widget."ID="IX-1013-2-144"callbacksaboutID="IX-1013-2-145" SPAN="START"callbacksaboutA callback list is a widget resource.
The application can add a callback routine to a widget
using XtAddCallback() or XtAddCallbacks() only if the
widget has declared a callback list as a resource.  When a widget
has a callback resource, it means that the widget writer
foresaw that users of the widget would want to have application code
called in response to a particular user behavior in that widget.
ID="IX-1013-2-146"callbacksas resourcesID="IX-1013-2-147"resourcescallbacksA widget class may have more than one callback resource.
The Motif ScrollBar widget, for example, has eight, in addition to
those defined by its superclasses Primitive and Core!  Each callback
resource represents a very specific occurrence in the widget.
This allows you to specify a different
function to handle each of these different occurrences.
One of these resources, XmNpageIncrementCallback, is
called when the user indicates that the information displayed should
be paged down.  XmNincrementCallback is similar but it
indicates that the data should be moved a smaller amount.
The purpose of the XmNpageDecrementCallback,
XmNtoTopCallback, and XmNtoBottomCallback should now be
obvious.
Each of these callbacks indicates a different kind of
user behavior, and requires a different kind of movement of the data
in the associated window.  The callback function registered with each
of these callback resources would actually move the data in the
various ways.
ID="IX-1013-2-148"resourcesXmNdestroyCallback (Core)
All widgets also have the callback XmNdestroyCallback, which
is called when the widget is destroyed.Note that a callback function is registered for a specific callback
resource and on a specific widget instance.  Therefore, two widgets
can have different functions registered for the same callback resource.The next section describes how to use callbacks, since they
are by far the more often used of the two techniques to link
the user interface with application code.  The use of actions
is demonstrated in LINKEND="CH-1013-4-1""Chapter 4, An Example Application."ID="IX-1013-2-149" SPAN="END"actionsaboutID="IX-1013-2-150" SPAN="END"callbacksaboutID="S2-1013-2-11"CallbacksTo illustrate the use of callbacks from the application,
we will write an application that uses the PushButton widget.
Some analogue of this widget is
present in every widget set.  It contains a string or picture,
and executes a command when a pointer button is clicked on it.ID="IX-1013-2-151" SPAN="START"PushButton widgetA PushButton widget calls an application
function when you press and release the first pointer button
(by default) in its window.  When you
press and hold the pointer button in the PushButton widget's window,
the PushButton widget redraws the window in a slightly darker color,
and swaps the colors of the two portions of the 3-D shadow
surrounding the window.  This gives the illusion that the button is
actually being pressed into the screen.  Moving the held button out
of the window resets the widget without executing the command.ID="IX-1013-2-152"xgoodbye.c exampleThe xgoodbye program creates a single PushButton widget.  It is
very similar to xhello, but takes advantage of the callback
provided by the PushButton widget.
Clicking on the "Goodbye, Cruel World" button exits the program.LINKEND="FG-1013-02-11"Figure 2-11  shows the window that xgoodbye creates if
you have installed the suggested app-defaults file
(otherwise, it will
display "goodbye").  It is suggested that you compile and run
xgoodbye.c, testing its response to moving the pointer in and
out of its window, and clicking the various pointer buttons on its window.ID="FG-1013-02-11"The appearance of xgoodbye when the pointer is in the windowFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="02.11.gif" ID="GC-1013-2-11"This example is not as frivolous as it seems.

a callback function.  In this example we have some application code (the
Quit function) that we register with Xt as a callback function for the
widget called goodbye using the XtAddCallback() call.
ID="IX-1013-2-154"XtAddCallbackID="IX-1013-2-155"callbacksaddingThe Quit function is defined before main, so that we
can use the function pointer Quit in the XtAddCallback() call.
It is also legal in C to declare Quit as a function pointer
early in the application,
but actually to define it further down in the source code.The XtAddCallback() call used to register Quit as
the PushButton widget's callback is as follows:ID="SC-1013-2-6"XtAddCallback(goodbye, XmNactivateCallback, Quit, 0);ID="IX-1013-2-156" SPAN="END"PushButton widgetID="IX-1013-2-157"XtAddCallbackID="IX-1013-2-158"callbacksaddingID="IX-1013-2-159"XtAddCallbackargumentsThe first argument, goodbye, is the widget that is to
trigger the callback.  The second argument,
XmNactivateCallback, is a
symbolic constant that identifies
which of the widget's callback resources is being set.
(This constant, like almost all resource names in Motif, is
defined in the file <Xm/Xm.h>.   Other widget sets define
resource name constants in the public header files of individual
widgets.)The third argument of XtAddCallback() is the function the
widget is to call, and the last argument is any data to
be passed to the callback function.  No data is to be passed to
Quit.  Later on we'll show many examples where this argument
is used to pass data.
ID="IX-1013-2-160"XtAddCallbackargumentsID="IX-1013-2-161"callbacksformatID="IX-1013-2-162"callbacksarguments to
The Quit function itself, like all callback functions,
takes three arguments:ID="SC-1013-2-7"void Quit(w, client_data, call_data)MARK="BULLET"The first argument is the widget that triggered the
callback, as specified as the first argument in
XtAddCallback().  You would use the value of this argument
in your callback function if you registered the same function as
a callback for two different widgets, and if you wanted to
distinguish in the callback which widget the user clicked on.The second argument, client_data, is the value passed as
the last argument of XtAddCallback().
This can be any data that you need in the callback function.The third argument, call_data, is a piece of data passed
from the widget.  Some classes of widget set this argument, but others
do not.  The documentation for the widget will specify the contents of this
data if it is used.  The PushButton widget doesn't provide any
call_data, but the ScrollBar widget, for example, passes
back the current position of the thumb.If you are intentionally not going to use one or more of these
arguments, you should place the comment /* ARGSUSED */ on the
line before the function.  This
prevents the C program checker lint from complaining about
the unused arguments.  The lint program can help you catch
problems in your code that the C compiler can't detect.
See the Nutshell Handbook Checking C Programs
with lint for more details.

action function names as well) are capitalized.
This lessens the chance of collision with other variables names because
callback functions are global in the source file.
If this convention is not used, the most common collision is between
callback functions and widget IDs of type Widget.
It is tempting to call the quit callback function quit,
and also to call the quit widget quit, but this will result in
mysterious errors or a core dump.
If you follow the convention that callback functions are given a
capitalized name such as Quit, you avoid this potential

that uses widgets for its user interface and connects
the widgets to application
code.  However, in order to really take advantage of any widget
class, you have to learn about its resources, so that you can set
the desired resources in the app-defaults file.ID="IX-1013-2-172"inheritanceaboutID="IX-1013-2-173"resourcesinheritance of
A class defines its own resources and also inherits the resources
of all its superclasses.  For example, PushButton supports not only its
own resources
but also the resources of its superclasses, Label, Primitive, and Core.
The documentation for
a widget class may describe only the resources for that class and list
the name of the immediate superclass (which you can then look up), or
it may list all the resources of that class and all superclasses.ID="S2-1013-2-12"Setting and Getting Resources from the ApplicationID="IX-1013-2-174"resourcessetting; in applicationID="IX-1013-2-175"resourcesvalues; gettingResources are not just for customization of widgets at application
startup.  The application can change resources of widgets that have
already been created, before or while the application is displayed.
The application can also query the value of most resources.
This section describes first how to set resources and then how to
get them.Setting resources is perhaps most often used for resetting strings in
Label widgets.  This can be very useful, but you should be aware that
setting a resource from the application wipes out the app-defaults or
user-specified value for that same resource (if any), unless you
first query the resource, and then set it based on its earlier value.
It is especially important not to hardcode strings if you want to
ID="IX-1013-2-176"languageportability
be able to change the language used by the application simply by
changing app-default files.There are two parallel sets of functions
that set or get resources.  The two versions of each function have the
same name except that one begins with XtVa and the other with
Xt only.
The arguments of both functions pass in or pass out resource name/value
pairs, but they do it using a slightly different format of arguments.
The XtVa style uses an ANSI C varargs list, which is a
NULL-terminated list of resource name/value pairs.  The Xt
version
takes an array of Arg structures (called an ArgList)
and an array length.  Each Arg structure contains a resource
name/value pair.  We will call these two styles the varargs
style and the ArgList style.The ArgList routines were the only
interface until R4, and they can still be used.
Using the ArgList form of call
is slightly more efficient than the varargs form, since
internally the varargs routines simply massage their arguments into
the ArgList forms.  However, the ArgList form
is more verbose, hard to read, and error-prone, and
lacks some of the features supported by the varargs form.
The loss of efficiency of the varargs form is probably
insignificant unless you depend on maximum speed in setting or
getting resources many times in a loop.
We use the varargs interface in most of this book,
but will also show you how to use the ArgList form in the following
sections so that you can understand existing applications written
using them.  Also, Motif provides only ArgList forms for some of
its functions.The following sections demonstrate how to set and get resources of an
existing widget using the ArgList and varargs interfaces.  The
same form of arguments are used in many other functions that set
resources, often while creating various types of widgets.
LINKEND="TB-1013-2-1"Table 2-1 presents the parallel lists of Xt functions.  The final arguments of
all of these (many of which have not yet been described) are used in
exactly the same manner as in the examples shown in LINKEND="S3-1013-2-5"Section 2.5.1.1, "Setting Resources with the Varargs Interfaces" and LINKEND="S3-1013-2-6"Section 2.5.1.2, "Setting Resources with the ArgList Interfaces."ID="TB-1013-2-1" COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"ArgListLEFT="180" WIDTH="356"VarargsLEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtSetValues()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaSetValues()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtGetValues()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaGetValues()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtCreateWidget()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaCreateWidget()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtCreateManagedWidget()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaCreateManagedWidget()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtAppCreateShell()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaAppCreateShell()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtGetSubresources()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaGetSubresources()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtGetApplicationResources()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaGetApplicationResources()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtCreatePopupShell()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaCreatePopupShell()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtSetSubvalues()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaSetSubvalues()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtGetSubvalues()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaGetSubvalues()LEFT="0" WIDTH="171"XtAppInitialize()LEFT="180" WIDTH="356"XtVaAppInitialize()LBL="2-1"Table 2-1   Functions that Set Resources: ArgList and varargs CounterpartsID="S3-1013-2-5"Setting Resources with the Varargs InterfacesID="IX-1013-2-177"setting resources in applicationID="IX-1013-2-178"XtVaGetValuesID="IX-1013-2-179"XtVaSetValuesThe easiest way to
set and get resources is to use the Xt functions
XtVaSetValues() and XtVaGetValues().
Each of these functions
takes a widget argument and a variable length list of
resource name/value pairs, terminated by NULL.
These interfaces are new to R4.Note that the resource to set is called XmNlabelString,
and its value must be a special type called a compound string,
represented by a structure of type XmString.  A single
compound string can be multi-lingual, multiline, and multifont.
A compound string contains a string, a character set, and a
draw direction (left to right or right to left).
The strings we specified in the app-defaults files for xhello
and xgoodbye were automatically converted into compound
strings by Xt.  However, to set a string in the application code,
we must do this conversion ourselves.  This is done easily with
the Motif function
ID="IX-1013-2-180"XmStringCreateLocalizedXmStringCreateLocalized().  (Motif also provides numerous other
functions for manipulating compound strings.)
XmStringCreateLocalized() replaces XmStringCreateSimple()
which was
ID="IX-1013-2-181"XmStringCreateSimple
used in Motif 1.1.
XmStringCreateLocalized() interprets its string argument
in the user's locale (the user's language and culture, usually
based on data from files defined by ANSI-C).  Therefore,
all strings should be read from the resource database or from files,
not defined in the code.  For simplicity, however, we have shown
the strings defined in the code.LINKEND="EX-1013-02-5"Example 2-5  shows the code needed to change the string
of a Label widget--this will work any time after the widget
has been created, either before or after the widget is realized.

XmStringFree(text);Note that a single XtVaSetValues() call can set any number of resources of a single widget instance.  
This example also changes the
justification of the string (which by default is centered).
(In order for justification to appear, the widget must be wider
than the string being displayed.  This can be arranged with the
resource setting *hello.width: 400.)ID="IX-1013-2-184"stringsStringDefs.h header fileID="IX-1013-2-185"include filesID="IX-1013-2-186"header files
The resource names used in the above example are XmNalignment
and XmNlabelString.
The include file <Xm/Xm.h> contains
these resource name symbolic constants.
Resource names are actually strings.
ID="IX-1013-2-187"resourcessymbolic constants
These strings are stored in symbolic
constants to improve compile-time checking.
If you misspell a symbolic constant, the
compiler will note the error.  If you misspell a string, on the other
hand, the error will go unnoticed by the compiler and go unnoticed
at run time as well, but the resource setting will do nothing.
Therefore, all resource names are specified using constants of the
form XmNname, where name is the resource name.When you use a widget set other than Motif, you include
<X11/StringDefs.h> instead of <Xm/Xm.h>.  In
StringDefs.h the same set of strings are given symbolic
constants that begin with XtN.  Motif has redefined these
symbols just so that all its symbols and functions begin with Xm.Also note that the value specified for each resource setting must
be the type expected by the widget for that resource, or an error will
occur.  In this case, the type is XmString.
If you were to attempt to pass a normal char * as the value,
the widget would report the error at run time.
In XtVaSetValues() calls (and XtSetValues() calls
described in the next section), conversion from strings to the
appropriate type does not happen automatically as it does for
settings in resource files.  However, you can arrange for it to
happen by placing special arguments in the XtVaSetValues() call,
as described in LINKEND="S2-1013-3-16"Section 3.8.2, "Using the Argument List Interfaces."  (Note that this is a feature of the
varargs interfaces that is not supported by the ArgList interfaces.)
ID="IX-1013-2-188"float typesetting resourcesID="IX-1013-2-189"resourcessetting floatsDon't set resources of type float using the
XtVaSetValues() interface.  On some systems float is
widened to double (as specified in the Kernighan & Ritchie C
manual).  When this widening occurs, half the
bytes are read by the Intrinsics as a float, and the next 4
as the string name of another resource.  This can
point into invalid memory, and cause a segmentation fault.
Use XtSetArg() and XtSetValues() to avoid the problem.
However, since the value field of the Arg is a
long which may not be the same size as a float, use
the following approach:
ID="SC-1013-2-8"    Arg arg;
    union {
        int    int_value;
        float    float_value;
    } value;
    value.float_value = 3.2;
    XtSetArg (arg, "name", value.int_value);ID="S3-1013-2-6"Setting Resources with the ArgList InterfacesAs mentioned above, the use of the ArgList interfaces is less elegant
than the varargs interfaces just described, and ArgList interfaces lack
the ability to use Xt's value conversion mechanism.  However,
the ArgList interfaces were the only interfaces
until R4, and therefore are used in most existing applications.
LINKEND="EX-1013-02-6"Example 2-6 shows how to set resources using XtSetValues().

a structure containing the name and value pair that defines a resource:ID="SC-1013-2-9"typedef struct {
    String      name;
    XtArgVal    value;
} Arg, *ArgList;The definition of XtArgVal differs depending on
architecture--its purpose
is precisely to make code portable between architectures with different
byte sizes.  Its use in application code is demonstrated in
LINKEND="S2-1013-3-16"Section 3.8.2, "Using the Argument List Interfaces."  All resource values (in all varargs and ArgList
calls) are limited to the size of XtArgVal, which is the largest
of char *, caddr_t, long, int *, and
proc *.
This means that for larger pieces of data, a pointer must
be used.  For example, data of type float or
double must be passed as pointers.
The documentation for a widget class that declares a
resource with a large value should document the fact that a pointer
must be passed rather than the value itself.ID="IX-1013-2-191"XtSetArgXtSetArg() is a macro that makes it more convenient to set the
two members of the Arg structure.  If desired, you can also
set the Arg structure members like any other C structure by
using the . or -> syntax.Note that the first member of Arg is of type String,
but should be set to one of the XmN resource name constants.ID="IX-1013-2-192"XtSetValuesXtSetValues() is the call that actually changes the widget
resource.  You pass it the widget to be reconfigured, a list of
Arg structures, and the length of the list.
LINKEND="EX-1013-02-6"Example 2-6
sets only one resource, so the list length is 1.XtSetValues() can set any
number of resources of a single widget instance.
LINKEND="EX-1013-02-7"Example 2-7 shows the
code necessary to set two resources.
Compare this to

the XtSetArg()
macro, because that macro references its first argument twice.
Therefore, the counter is customarily incremented on the end of the
same line, so that additional resource settings can easily be added.ID="S3-1013-2-7"Getting a Resource ValueIt is also useful to be able to get the current value of a widget
resource.  One use of this is in finding out what
value the user has specified for a particular resource, so that it
can be modified with application data.
Because C-Language arguments are passed by
value, and some resource values are not actual values but pointers
to them, it is important to thoroughly understand pointers
while getting widget values.
LINKEND="EX-1013-02-8"Example 2-8 shows how to get a pointer
to the current string in a Label widget, using the varargs interface.
This has to be done in two steps: first query the
XmNlabelString resource to get the compound string, and
then extract the character array from the compound string.
Querying other resources is easier.ID="EX-1013-02-8"Code fragment to get a widget resource using XtVaGetValues#define MAXLEN 256

In the Athena widgets, a string queried from a
resource must not be modified or freed by the application, since it
points directly to private widget data.
In Motif, the compound string returned from XtVaGetValues()
(or XtGetValues(), of course)
should be freed after use with XmStringFree() or
XtFree() (they are equivalent), since Motif widgets
pass a pointer to a copy of the resource value stored in the widget,
not to a pointer to the widget's internal data.LINKEND="EX-1013-02-9"Example 2-9 shows how to query a widget resource using the ArgList interface,

your app-defaults file can control the layout of the application.
You should always resize widgets by setting these resources--never
resize or move a widget's window using Xlib calls since this would make Xt's
knowledge of window geometries inaccurate.  Nor should you use
the Xt functions XtConfigureWidget(), XtMoveWidget(),
or XtResizeWidget() from the application.  These routines
are intended to be used only by geometry-managing composite
widgets.

The XmNbackground, XmNbackgroundPixmap, XmNborderWidth,
XmNborderColor, and
XmNborderPixmap widget resources control
the background and border of the window created by a widget.  The background
and border of a window are maintained by the X server,
and setting these resources
causes an immediate change in the window on the screen.
You can set either a background color or a background pixmap,
but not both.  Whichever is set later
takes priority.  The same applies to the border.
Details on the possible values to which these may be set are in ENDTERM="XLib_PG" LINKEND="CH-1002-4-1"Chapter 4, "Window Attributes" of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.ID="IX-1013-2-236"pixmapaboutA pixmap is similar to a window but is off-screen.  It is an array
of pixels.  When used as a background or border, a pixmap is
tiled by laying out multiple copies of it side by side, for the purpose
of patterning.  Pixmaps are also used for icon patterns, in drawing,
and as a temporary drawing surface later copied to a window.
ID="IX-1013-2-237"tilingThe XmNbackground and XmNborderColor resources can be

trigger a widget's actions or the actions your application
has registered.  XmNaccelerators contains an accelerator

widgets to specify whether a widget should be eligible for

geometry management, or whether this should not happen until some
later time.  We'll talk more about this concept in
LINKEND="CH-1013-12-1""Chapter 12, Geometry Management."The XmNdestroyCallback resource, as mentioned in LINKEND="S2-1013-2-11"Section 2.4.1, "Callbacks" above, lets you provide an application function to be called when a widget is

handles the job of freeing widget data structures and any server
resources.ID="IX-1013-2-245"sensitivityThe XmNsensitive resource controls whether a widget responds to user
input.  This allows you to turn on or off user input in a
certain widget at will.  For example, if you have a
PushButton widget whose command is not allowed at certain
times, you would set XmNsensitive to False during the period the
command is not allowed.  The PushButton widget changes its own look to indicate
that it is invalid.The XmNancestorSensitive resource specifies whether the
widget's parent (or earlier ancestor) is sensitive.  Sensitivity
is automatically propagated downward, such that if any ancestor is
insensitive, a widget is insensitive.
This resource rarely needs to be set, but is sometimes useful to query.

use xrdb -load instead.
Note, however, that this will replace all of your

you will find some unexpected behavior.  For instance, setting
the value of the x and y resources has
no effect.  Regardless of their value, the xgoodbye
application is simply placed at the current pointer position.The reason for this is that
these resources set the widget position relative to its parent,
and since the goodbye widget is a child of an
identically sized Shell widget, they are meaningless.  In its
geometry-management policy, the shell widget ignores the value of
these resources.
ID="IX-1013-2-258"Shell widget; aboutID="IX-1013-2-259"positionsetting with resourcesIf instead you use the x and y resources to try
to set the position of the application:ID="SC-1013-2-11"xgoodbye.x:  100
xgoodbye.y:  100they are ignored also, for a similar reason.
It is customary for the window manager to assert
control over the position of the main application window (in this
case the Shell widget goodbye), and take the value of these
resources, whether set by the application or by the user, simply
as "hints" to the desired behavior.  There is no guarantee
that the window manager will honor these hints.
ID="IX-1013-2-260"positionaboutID="IX-1013-2-261"hintsposition
The application
is generally free to move widgets within its own window, but not
to move itself.  The basic X philosophy is that the user (through
the window manager), not the application, should be in control.
(Kill the window manager, or run a window manager that honors
application position hints, and the resource specifications
shown just above will work.)Likewise, you will find that
specifying:ID="SC-1013-2-12"*goodbye.borderWidth:  10has no effect, while:ID="SC-1013-2-13"*borderWidth: 10ID="IX-1013-2-262"inheritancewidget not using resource valueworks.  The reason for this behavior is that while the PushButton
widget inherits the borderWidth resource from Core, it does nothing
with its value.  Only certain widget classes (Shells) use the
borderWidth resource to set the border width of their window.
Just because a resource is inherited by a widget does not mean
that the widget's methods do anything to use its value.Another surprising fact appears if you set the
foreground resource to the same color as the background.
No text appears in the window, and it does not highlight itself when
you move the mouse inside.  However, if you click a button, you will find
that the widget is still working.  What is happening is that the background
and foreground colors are now both white, and therefore there is no contrast
with which to see the widget's drawing.  The widget is not
sophisticated enough to check that its two colors are not the same.
(Adding this simple check would be easy, but it is much more
difficult to tell whether two colors that are not the same contrast enough.)ID="IX-1013-2-263"resourcesinteractions betweenThe cautionary point is that there may be unexpected interactions between
resources in widget code.  Like programs in general, widgets tend to do
what you say, not what you mean.  A well-designed widget will minimize
ill effects, but given the amount of customization that is
possible, it may take some time to uncover all the possible
pitfalls.  Unfortunately, the documentation for most existing
widgets doesn't always do a good job of explaining how
resources are used inside the widget.ID="S1-1013-2-6"Advice on X ProgrammingThe X Window System is a very complex collection of software,
not to try your patience, but to
do things that no programming tools have done before.  Not only
does X provide tools to build a nice user interface, but it does so
with network transparency, so that programs can run on any hardware
and operating system and display on any other.Probably the best feature of all from the application developer's point
of view is the portability of the source between hardware and
operating systems.  It is worth a lot of aggravation to be able to
write just one version of a piece of software, and have it able to
compile and run on anything from a PC-compatible to a Cray.The price you pay for these features is additional complexity.
The key to programming X successfully is to keep things as
simple as possible by keeping this complexity hidden.By choosing to use Xt and Motif, you have
taken a first step to isolate your application from the details of
the lower levels of X software.
In general, use the highest-level tools available.
Use Motif functions instead of Xt functions when equivalents are available,
and Xt functions instead of Xlib functions.Also beware of configuring widgets too extensively.
Every widget has many resources, and the number of possible
permutations in even one widget makes it impossible for OSF
to test them exhaustively.  At the same time, programmers tend to
abuse this flexibility by overly configuring
widgets.  Often developers try to make Motif
applications work in a particular way that Motif's developers didn't
intend or foresee.  One way to avoid this problem is to make sure
your intended interface conforms to the conventions specified in the
OSF/Motif Style Guide.Although Motif will undoubtedly be improved to
support even more varied interfaces, this will take time, and there
will always be features that Motif will not support without
contortions.  If you can compromise a little on the details of how
your interface should work, you will be better off.
With Motif, you can get 90 percent of what you want
in a very short time.  Think twice before spending lots of time trying
to get the last 10 percent.  First think if there is some other user
interface design that can fulfill your needs while being more consistent
with Motif style.  If you still insist on having that functionality,
think carefully about the best way to implement it (and consult with
someone who knows X intimately, because such a decision may require an
understanding of Motif, Xt, and the lower levels of X).To be advised to compromise in this fashion may rub some programmers
the wrong way.  Most programmers program systems where they have
total control over their environment.  Many have
the whole screen to play with, and worry about only one target
system.  In these environments, it is more practical to learn
everything there is to know about the system, so that you can implement
exactly what you want.  Since X is a much larger piece of software
than the operating system or toolbox of any one computer, it is
less practical to obtain a complete understanding of every level of it.
That's why it is better to use your creativity to design a
good interface that can be implemented easily, using existing
components in the ways they were designed to be used.ID="S1-1013-2-7"Debugging Xt ApplicationsID="IX-1013-2-264"debuggingDebugging Xt applications can be difficult because errors caused
by your code can end up causing the program to abort somewhere deep
in the Xt Intrinsics.  There are, however, several techniques that
can help.One problem is that the standard error handlers
exit so that you won't get a stack trace to tell you
where the problem occurred.  The workaround is
to register your own Xlib and Xt error handlers
that divide by zero after reporting the error (instead of
exiting).  See LINKEND="CH-1013-14-1" NUMBER="14"Chapter 14, "Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques" for information on registering Xt error handlers, and ENDTERM="XLib_PG" LINKEND="DI-1002-1-1"Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual for Xlib error handlers.If your application generates X protocol errors, then the problem
is probably Xlib calls with improper arguments.  Because
of the asynchronous X protocol, the program will not exit
at the error in the code.  By running
the application with the -sync command-line option, Xlib
operates in synchronous mode and Xlib errors are reported
immediately.The editres application is useful for debugging widgets,
testing resource settings, and for viewing the widget hierarchy of
complex applications.  The uses of the editres application
are described in Chapter 14.You are not normally allowed to see the data stored inside
widget data structures.  But you can view the data from a debugger
if you specify the private header file for the widget in your
source file.  For example, instead of including <Xm/Xm.h> and
<Xm/XmPushB.h> in xhello.c, we would include
<Xm/XmP.h> and <Xm/XmPushBP.h>.Finally, an integrated code development and debugging environment
such as CodeCenter is invaluable in writing toolkit application

atypical because they contained only one widget.
Because any real application has several widgets,
some way of laying them out is needed.
This is tedious to do manually.
Therefore, the first widget you create after calling
XtAppInitialize() is usually a composite
widget, whose job it is to manage the layout of a group of child
widgets.  The parent of this composite widget is the Shell widget
created by XtAppInitialize(), usually called topLevel.

ID="IX-1013-3-12"gadgetsabout
to consider using gadgets instead of widgets.  A gadget is
a windowless widget, with somewhat reduced features.  Motif provides
gadget versions of many of its smaller, simpler widgets, such
as PushButton.  The gadget version of PushButton is
ID="IX-1013-3-13"PushButton widgetID="IX-1013-3-14"PushButtonGadget
PushButtonGadget.  For the most part, gadgets are created and used
just like widgets.
Since a gadget has no window, it loads the server and the network
less and can attain better performance.  For example, one of the
Motif demos, xmfonts, creates over 100 PushButtonGadgets as
children of a single RowColumn widget.  In that case, it definitely
makes sense to use gadgets.  Probably the most common use of gadgets in
applications, though, is for the panes in menus.  Therefore,
ID="IX-1013-3-15"menuspanes
we will reserve our major discussion of gadgets until LINKEND="CH-1013-13-1""Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups."ID="S2-1013-3-1"Setting Resources for an Instance HierarchyID="IX-1013-3-16"resourcessetting; for multiple widgetsYou have already seen how an app-defaults file can set the

an instance hierarchy that contains a RowColumn widget with two
PushButton widgets as children.
It is worth seeing how to set the PushButton

resource specifications can either identify individual widget
instances by name or can use wildcards or widget class names to
reference more than one widget.  The first two specifications in the
example identify the pressme and quit widgets by
instance name.
The third specification uses the class name PushButton to
set the font of both PushButton widgets in the application.
This line shows that resources of groups of widgets can be
set with a single line.
The fourth specification uses the class name RowColumn to set
the background of the RowColumn widget (but not
the PushButton widgets) to the
color green.
Whenever you use a class name, it will match all widgets of that
class in the application, even ones we add later in a later revision
of the application.
ID="IX-1013-3-19"classname; matching widgetsBy changing the period in the fourth specification
to an asterisk, the specification will change the background color of
not only all RowColumn widgets in the application, but also all their
children, and their children, recursively.
Remember from Chapter 2 that an asterisk matches zero or any number
of intervening widget instance names or class names.
In xrowcolumn, this setting will make the background of the
RowColumn and PushButton widgets green.
Try not to get careless with asterisks, though.  They lead you
to think you don't have to remember the instance hierarchy in your
application, but this can backfire, because it is easy to set
resources on more widgets than you realize.Note that you need to know the instance name for each widget in
the application in order to set its resources individually.  This is
true for all resource files, including the ones customized by the
user.  Therefore, in the documentation for your application, be sure
to include the name and class of each widget in your instance hierarchy.
To be thorough, also include a description of the
resources of each class, and specify which resources the user can
customize.ID="IX-1013-3-20"XtCreateManagedWidgetThe first argument of each XtVaCreateManagedWidget()
call is the widget instance name.  This is the name used to set
resources for this widget in the resource databases.  Most
programmers make the widget
instance name the same as the variable name of type
Widget that holds the widget
ID.  This lexical connection is not mandatory, but it is highly
recommended because it reduces confusion
by helping you to remember the connection between entries in
the app-defaults file and the widget instances in the
application.ID="S2-1013-3-2"Geometry Management in PracticeID="IX-1013-3-21"geometry managementThe purpose of geometry managing widgets is two-fold:NUMERATION="ARABIC"They take most of the tedium out of determining the initial positions
of widgets.They recalculate the positions of all the widgets when the user
resizes the application, so that the application still looks good.Build and run xrowcolumn, and then try resizing
it to see how the RowColumn widget deals with various geometries.
This is the default behavior of RowColumn--it can be customized
with resources to use many different layout rules.

its app-defaults file, run it again, and try out its resizing

What happens if you use resource settings in the app-defaults file to
directly set the size or position of a widget that is being managed
by a geometry managing widget?
Depending on the specific geometry managing widget, you may not get
the desired effect.  For example,
trying to set the size of the PushButton widgets managed by
RowColumn may not work.
For example, if you added the resource setting
*pressme.height: 400, it would have no effect on the height of
the pressme widget unless allowShellResize is also set
to True (if you are using mwm).
This is because the RowColumn widget needs to ask its parent,
the shell widget, to be resized,
and this will be denied unless mwm allows the shell to resize itself.
However, it is possible to set things like geometries in the application code,
as will be demonstrated later in this chapter.Every widget's size and position is ultimately under
the control of the window manager.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-2"ID="FN-1013-3-2"BulletinBoard creates an exception to this rule.
Since BulletinBoard never resizes its children,
the window manager controls which of these children are visible,
but does not resize them.
A RowColumn widget attempts to
make itself just big enough to hold its children, using the
resources provided by the application as a guide,
but the window manager can override
anything the widget or the application does.ID="IX-1013-3-25"window managerWhat happens when the user resizes an application is only part of the
picture.  The application itself may need to resize one of its widgets
in order to display more widgets.  Or the application may tell a
widget to display more data and the widget will have to ask its
parent to be resized.  For example, what happens when the
application changes the string in one of the PushButton widgets while
the application is displayed?
ID="IX-1013-3-26"Motif widgetsPushButton widgetID="IX-1013-3-27"PushButton widgetID="IX-1013-3-28"widgetsresizing
The PushButton widget attempts to resize itself
to display the current string,
by asking its parent for permission.Whether this request is
granted depends on the position of the widget in the instance hierarchy,
the resizing policy imposed by each composite widget in the hierarchy,
and the window manager.
This is because each widget, from the PushButton widget on up, negotiates
with its parent when the PushButton widget requests a new size.
The PushButton widget tries to change size to accommodate the new
string (larger or smaller), and the RowColumn
widget must approve this change.  Since the RowColumn widget is
already the same size as the Shell widget, RowColumn can't get any
larger without asking Shell.  The Shell widget is responsible for
negotiating with the window manager.The mwm window managers
will allow applications to resize themselves only if the user
has set the allowShellResize resource to True.
(Some other window managers, such as twm, never allow it.)
Otherwise, the RowColumn widget will reject the resize request
unless the original change made the PushButton widget smaller.
If the new size is rejected, the PushButton widget will still display the
new string, but it may not show all of the string (if the new string is
longer than the old one) or there may be extra space left over (if the
old string was longer).
ID="IX-1013-3-29"Shell widget; aboutID="IX-1013-3-30"window managerID="IX-1013-3-31"geometry managementFortunately, all this negotiation is done by the widgets themselves.
The application doesn't need to do anything.  However, you should be
aware that any widget resource change that results in a widget size
change may not work unless there is enough room in the application
for the change to be granted without resizing the top-level window.ID="IX-1013-3-32"Motif widgetsRowColumn widgetThe RowColumn widget is Motif's most comprehensive and powerful
geometry managing widget.  It is widely used for managing groups of
small widgets in many settings.
(Some of these uses of RowColumn are under other names,
such as CheckBox, PullDownMenu, and MenuBar.)
However, it treats all its children
the same, and therefore isn't appropriate for
widgets of radically different geometries.  RowColumn's
decisions about where to place the widgets can be inappropriate.
LINKEND="FG-1013-03-3"Figure 3-3 shows the results upon resizing of a RowColumn widget that is

it would be difficult to keep it good looking after resizing.
ID="IX-1013-3-36"RowColumn widgetexampleBecause no single geometry managing widget can satisfy all needs,
there are several different types of composite widgets in
most widget sets, each with different rules about how it places
children.  Many widget sets, including Motif, have
a widget specifically designed to place scrollbars next to a main
window.
In Motif, this widget is called ScrolledWindow.
ID="IX-1013-3-37"scrollbarsScrolledWindow widgetID="IX-1013-3-38"Motif widgetsPanedWindow widgetID="IX-1013-3-39"PanedWindow widget
Of course, applications are not limited to using only one composite
widget.  It is quite common for the application's main window to be
a large composite widget which contains several smaller composite
widgets, each of which in turn contains certain groups
of related widgets.
You'll need to design the layout of widgets in
your application, decide where in the instance hierarchy to place
composite widgets, and experiment to find out which composite widgets
provide the best appearance when the application is resized.
The following application shows how several kinds of geometry
managing widgets can be used together in an application.LINKEND="FG-1013-03-4"Figure 3-4 shows the xmh application
ID="IX-1013-3-40"xmh
and the instance hierarchy used to create it.  This application
is built using the Athena widgets.  However, analogues of all these
widgets are available in Motif, and the application could easily be
ported.  The top
composite widget in xmh is of the Athena Paned class
(equivalent to PanedWindow).
ID="IX-1013-3-41"Paned widgetabout
The Paned widget
creates several horizontal panels, or panes, one for each child, with
a sash positioned on the line between each pane.
Each pane contains a
different functional area of the application.ID="FG-1013-03-4"The xmh application and its instance hierarchyFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="03.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-3-4"MARK="BULLET"The top pane
is a menubar (implemented with a Box widget, a simpler version of
RowColumn) containing oval Athena MenuButton
widgets (equivalent to CascadeButton).The next pane is a Label
widget (equivalent to Label).The third pane is another Box widget
containing Command widgets (equivalent to PushButton).
The fourth pane is another Label widget.The fifth pane is a
geometry managing widget called a Viewport (equivalent to
ScrolledWindow) containing a Text widget (equivalent to Text).So, you see, there are three different kinds of geometry managing
widgets in this application: Paned, Box, and Viewport.  In a Motif
port of this application, they would be PanedWindow, RowColumn,
and ScrolledWindow.Box and Viewport are relatively simple geometry managing widgets
that are subclasses of the Composite class.
The Paned widget is a more complex kind of geometry managing
widget which is a subclass of the Constraint class.
Both Composite and Constraint are basic classes defined by the
Xt Intrinsics.ID="S1-1013-3-2"Using Constraint WidgetsID="IX-1013-3-42" SPAN="START"Form widgetaboutID="IX-1013-3-43"constraint widgetsaboutConstraint widgets, like composite widgets, manage the layout of
children.  The difference is that constraint widgets let the
application provide layout information for each child.  This is a
more powerful way to arrange children because it allows you to provide
different rules for how each child will be laid out.In an application, you create a constraint widget just as you would
any other widget.  But you don't just set resources of the constraint widget
to specify how each child is laid out.  You also set resources
of each child of the constraint widget.  Once any child widget
is placed under the management of a constraint widget, the child
suddenly has a special set of resources defined by the constraint
widget, which controls
its layout.  As usual, these resources can be set from
the app-defaults file, from any other resource database file,
or in the application code.ID="IX-1013-3-44"Motif widgetsForm widgetWe'll demonstrate how constraint widgets
work by replacing the RowColumn widget in xrowcolumn (LINKEND="EX-1013-03-1"Example 3-1) with a Motif Form widget (a constraint
widget).  This example is called xform in the example source
code.  We won't show this entire code, because the differences from
xrowcolumn1 are slight.  The basic change is that all
occurrences of rowColumn and RowColumn are changed to
form and Form, respectively.
The real difference between xrowcolumn and xform
lies in the setting of resources.The Form widget defines a number of constraint resources, which
to the user appear to be resources of the child widgets
managed by the Form.  Looking at these resources gives you a good
idea of the kinds of things that can be done with constraints.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-4"ID="FN-1013-3-4"Note that even though the Motif Form widget
and the Athena Form widget are both constraint widgets and have
similar names, they have radically different constraint resources.ID="IX-1013-3-45"resourcesForm widgetID="IX-1013-3-46"resourcesconstraintID="IX-1013-3-47"constraint widgetsresourcesID="IX-1013-3-48"constraint widgetsresources; example
Each edge of each child can be positioned in one of four ways.
Different children can use different rules at the same time, and
in fact different edges of the same child can be positioned using
different rules.  The following is a summary of what you can do
with Form constraints.  For details, see the Motif Reference Manual,
because the complete behavior of Form is quite complicated.For brevity, the following lists the various ways the
left edge of a child can be positioned.  You can substitute right,
top, and bottom in any of the following.NUMERATION="ARABIC"Relative to one edge of the Form widget.  To do this, you set the
XmNleftAttachment to XmATTACH_FORM.  This child edge
will then be positioned the default distance from the same edge of the
Form.  You can specify a different distance from the edge of Form
with the XmNleftPosition or XmNleftOffset resources.
The latter is a fixed distance that won't change after resizing.Relative to an edge of one of the other children.
To do this, you set the
XmNleftAttachment to XmATTACH_WIDGET, and set
XmNleftWidget to the Widget ID of the other child you want this
child to be next to.  XmNleftWidget can only be set in the
application code, not in resource files.To a percentage position within the Form widget (i.e., 50% would place
the edge in the center of the Form widget, and upon resizing the
edge would always be centered.)  Set XmNleftAttachment to
XmATTACH_POSITION, then set XmNleftPosition and
XmNfractionBase so that XmNleftPosition /XmNfractionBase is the fraction of the width of the
Form where the edge should be located.To a percentage position established by the child's initial position
within the Form widget.  For example, if the application code
initially positioned the child edge 20 pixels horizontally from the
Form origin, and
XmNfractionBase is set to 100 to represent the initial width
of the Form, then
the child edge will always be kept at 20% of the width of the Form.
Set XmNleftAttachment to
XmATTACH_SELF, then set
XmNfractionBase so that the current XmNx position
divided by XmNfractionBase is the fraction of the width of the
Form where the edge should be located.
The difference between XmATTACH_POSITION 
and XmATTACH_SELF is only
that the former requires the setting of XmNleftPosition, while
the latter takes the initial position directly from the child.Note that the XmNresizable resource is a constraint that
controls whether a child is allowed to resize itself, or be resized
by the application.  It does not affect whether the Form widget
will resize that widget--Form is always allowed to resize any of
its children.The Form also has a number of normal resources (that are set on the
Form, as opposed to constraint resources that are set on its
children) that control default distances and so on.
One of these is XmNrubberPositioning, which
governs how unattached edges of children behave.OSF in Motif 1.2 has made more Form constraints settable
from the app-defaults file.  In particular, they have added
a String-To-Widget converter which allows the setting of resources
such as XmNleftWidget.
Testing and debugging constraints is
much easier when done from resource files since you
avoid recompiling every time a new combination of Form
constraints is to be tried.

}ID="IX-1013-3-51"constraint widgetsresourcesID="IX-1013-3-52"constraint widgetsresources; exampleNotice that since these are constraints, these resources are being
set on the quit child of Form, but the Form will
actually use this information.
It is actually an instruction for the Form widget about where
to place the quit widget relative to the
pressme widget.  The effect of this resource setting is
shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-03-5"Figure 3-5.
Note that both widgets referenced in a
constraint must be child widgets of the same constraint widget, in
this case the Form widget.  If they are not, Form will print
a message at run time.If you run this program, you can compare
its behavior on resize with the behavior of
xrowcolumn, and you can experiment with different resource
settings for the Form widget.ID="FG-1013-03-5"Effect of the Form XmATTACH_WIDGET constraint resourceFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="03.05.gif" ID="GC-1013-3-5"Both the Form and RowColumn widgets are able to
resize the PushButton widgets in addition to or instead of moving
them.  In the Athena widget set there is a composite widget, Box,
that moves but never resizes its children.  Note that the difference
between composite and constraint widgets is not their ability to
resize children; it is that constraint widgets allow different
ID="IX-1013-3-53"constraint widgetsvs. composite widgets
layout rules for each child.Without constraint settings, Form widgets pile up their children.
This can also happen if you make an error in setting the constraints.
Sometimes this can make it appear that one of the
widgets has completely disappeared!
ID="IX-1013-3-54" SPAN="END"Form widgetaboutID="S1-1013-3-3"The Standard Motif Instance HierarchyMost Motif applications have a standard screen layout, which
leads to a certain amount of boilerplate code in every application.
This section describes that code.
LINKEND="FG-1013-03-6"Figure 3-6 shows an example application, xmainwindow, which has this
standard layout.  Of course, in a real application the lower area
would be more than an empty box.ID="FG-1013-03-6"xmainwindow: an application with standard Motif screen layoutFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="03.06.gif" ID="GC-1013-3-6"ID="IX-1013-3-55"screenexample of standard MotifID="IX-1013-3-56"screenlayout of
Customarily, the first widget created in a Motif application
(after the one created by XtAppInitialize()) is
a MainWindow widget.  A MainWindow is a geometry managing widget
ID="IX-1013-3-57" SPAN="START"MainWindow widget
designed to manage a work area (often a custom window) with
scrollbars, and optional
menubar and Command widgets.
In a drawing application, the drawing
area would be the custom window, and MainWindow would automatically
manage scrollbars that would allow the user
to draw in an area larger than the application's total screen area.
In our first example that includes a MainWindow, the
ID="IX-1013-3-58"Frame widget
work area will be simulated with a Frame widget, which is an
empty box with a 3-D appearance.ID="IX-1013-3-59"menusmenubarMost Motif applications also have a menubar across the top of the
main window.  Visually, the menubar contains labels which indicate
the titles of the menus available.  In widget terms, each of these
labels is a CascadeButton, which is similar to
a PushButton except that CascadeButton is specifically designed to
invoke a pulldown menu or dialog box instead of an application function.
Two of the most common labels visible
in a menubar are File and Help.  The File button brings up a menu
that includes the commands for reading and writing files, if any,
and also the command to quit the application.
According to the Motif style guide, the File button has the position
at the far left in the menubar, and the Help button has the far
right.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-5"ID="FN-1013-3-5"The menubar and the File menu are common features of
window-based graphical applications using other widget sets and other
window systems, including the Macintosh.
The Help button brings up 
a menu containing topics;
selecting a topic brings up a
dialog box which contains help text
appropriate for the current situation.ID="IX-1013-3-60"commandCommand widgetA Command widget is another horizontal band across the application,
just below the work area.  A Command widget contains two windows,
one that allows you to type in commands, and the other that shows you
the history of prior commands.  The Command widget is optional in
a MainWindow and is less common than the menubar.ID="S2-1013-3-3"Motif Widget Creation RoutinesID="IX-1013-3-61"widgetscreating; Motif vs. XtAll the previous examples have used XtVaCreateManagedWidget() to
create widgets.  As you may recall, you specify which type of widget
you want by supplying an argument such as
xmPushButtonWidgetClass.  But Motif also provides its own
functions for creating widgets.  To create a PushButton, Motif's
function is XmCreatePushButton().  Note, however, that Motif's
function does not manage the widget, so you need to call
XtManageChild() separately.  (If you forget, the widget won't
be visible.)  Also, as you will see later, it is harder to
set widget resources with the Motif widget creation functions.  In
the cases where the two techniques are identical, our examples stick
with the basic Xt routine.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-6"ID="FN-1013-3-6"This is less verbose, less prone to error, and saves one function call.In some cases, however, the Motif widget creation routines have code
beyond just calling the Xt widget creation routine.  Some set
resources in particular ways.  For example, XmCreateMenuBar()
actually creates a RowColumn widget, but with some special
resource settings.  It is a lot more convenient to use
XmCreateMenuBar() than to use the Xt widget creation routine and
set the resources yourself.
ID="IX-1013-3-62"XmCreateMenuBar functionAs in the case of XmCreateMenuBar(), the Motif widget creation routines
often have names that are different from the widgets they create.
There is no such thing as a MenuBar widget.  Remember this when you
look up a widget's resources in the Motif reference manual.
If you are unsure of the widget class, look on the page for the Motif
widget creation function first.Other Motif widget-creation functions actually create a combination of
widgets.  More will be said about this later.ID="S2-1013-3-4"Building a Main WindowWith that introduction, we are ready to show you the code needed to

}ID="IX-1013-3-63"MainWindow widgetcreation exampleThis code creates a MainWindow that contains two widgets: a menubar
(which is actually a kind of RowColumn configured as a menubar via
resources automatically set by the convenience function used to create
the widget) and a Frame.
Note that the parent arguments of functions that create the
menubar and the Frame are both mainWindow.We use XtVaCreateManagedWidget() to create the main window,
ID="IX-1013-3-64"XtCreateManagedWidget
but XmCreateMenuBar() to create the menubar, for the reasons
ID="IX-1013-3-65"XmCreateMenuBar function
described above.  Notice that widget name and widget parent arguments
are in a different order in the two functions.The menubar must be managed with a separate call to
XtManageChild(), because XmCreateMenuBar() does not
manage it.ID="IX-1013-3-66"XmMainWindowSetAreas functionXmMainWindowSetAreas() tells the main window which of
its children should be treated as the menubar (placed across the
top of the application), and which as the work area (at the bottom,
with scrollbars if needed).  The work area in this case is the
Frame widget.  The three unused arguments, here set to NULL,
allow you to tell MainWindow which widget is the Command window,
and which widgets are the scrollbars that will control the work area.You might ask, why does MainWindow need to be told which widget is
which, since it has access to its list of child widgets?  This is
done mainly for added flexibility,
so that you can switch work areas or other children.The purpose of the scrollbar arguments in
XmMainWindowSetAreas() is a common point of
confusion.  MainWindow is a subclass of ScrolledWindow.  That
means that MainWindow has all the features of ScrolledWindow,
plus more.  Therefore, MainWindow automatically creates its own
ID="IX-1013-3-67"scrollbars
scrollbars and uses these scrollbars to control the work area.
Why, then, should XmMainWindowSetAreas() allow you to tell
MainWindow which scrollbars to use, when MainWindow already has
its own scrollbars and knows how to use them?  The answer is that
in some cases an application wants to provide its own code to
handle the callbacks that connect its scrollbars with its work
region.  In practically all cases,
however, an application can use the scrollbars created automatically
by MainWindow or ScrolledWindow, even if it wishes to manually
connect those widgets with the work area.A resource setting is necessary
in order to make MainWindow display scrollbars and use them
to control the custom window.  Here is the portion of the
XMainWindow app-defaults file
that applies to the code shown so far:ID="SC-1013-3-4"! Set initial size of application
*XmMainWindow.width:  200
! Frame will be bigger that application, thus requiring scrollbars
*XmFrame.width:  300
*XmFrame.height:  300
! Make MainWindow display scrollbars and use them to
! pan around in the frame.
*XmMainWindow.scrollingPolicy:  XmAUTOMATICThe remaining part of the boilerplate code in a standard Motif
application is to build the File menu and Help button in the menubar,
ID="IX-1013-3-68" SPAN="START"File menucreating
that you see in xmainwindow.
This is described in the next section.ID="S1-1013-3-4"Using PopupsID="IX-1013-3-69"popupsaboutA popup is a widget that is displayed on the screen for short periods,
instead of being permanently visible.The two most common kinds of popup widgets are menus and dialog boxes.
Menus are familiar to most people, but dialog boxes are less so.
A dialog box is a box on the screen that contains a message, or
asks for user input, or both.  Sometimes a dialog box provides a way to
get input that is needed only occasionally and therefore doesn't
deserve a place in the permanently visible user interface.  Fitting into
this category is the Motif file selection box, which is commonly used
as a dialog box.  At other
times, a dialog box requires immediate response by the user before
the application can continue.  For example, many applications that
write files are capable of displaying a dialog box that says
"Warning: file exists.  Do you wish to overwrite?"A menu becomes
visible when the user presses a mouse button while the pointer is in one of
the CascadeButtons in the menubar.  It becomes invisible again
once the user has selected an item from the menu, released the button
outside the menu, or moved into another CascadeButton in the menubar.
Dialog boxes usually become visible either because a button such as
Help was clicked on by the user, or because the program needs
occasional user input that is best supplied through a temporary window
instead of as a permanently visible part of the application user
interface.
Dialog boxes become invisible when the user clicks on the OK or
Confirm button in the dialog box, or provides the input that the
dialog box is requesting.ID="IX-1013-3-70"transientShellWidgetClassPopups are not a kind of widget, but rather a way of using widgets.
Any widget can be used as a popup.  However, some classes of widgets
are more commonly used as popups, and Motif has simplified the interface
by providing routines that not only create these widgets, but also
prepare them for use as popups.  For example, Motif provides
XmCreatePopupMenu() for creating an empty popup menu.
Internally, this routine creates a special parent widget called an
OverrideShell, and then creates a RowColumn widget inside it, with
ID="IX-1013-3-71"OverrideShell widget
special resource settings.  It is then your job to create
widgets (or gadgets) to appear in the menu.A Motif menubar, as described in LINKEND="S1-1013-3-3"Section 3.3, "The Standard Motif Instance Hierarchy," usually
contains a File menu and a Help button that brings up a dialog box.
We'll discuss creating the File menu first, and then the Help dialog
box.

Popup menus have no on-screen presence until you press a certain button or 
key-button combination while in a certain widget.  
Pulldown menus and Option menus have buttons
on the screen--when you press the button the menu appears below (for
Pulldown) or over (for Option) the button.  
Option menus remember the most recent previous selection.
RadioBox and CheckBox can also be thought of as kinds of menus.
The menus that are invoked from the menubar are Pulldown menus.It's also worth mentioning that Motif 1.2 supports
tear-off menus.  This allows the user to move any menu which has its
XmNtearOffModel resource set to
TEAR_OFF_ENABLED from the location where
it first appears anywhere on the screen, and semi-permanently post it
there.  This makes it quicker to use commonly-used menus (especially
since the menus mnemonics--keyboard shortcuts--are only active
while a menu is displayed.The application can call
XmRepTypeInstallTearOffModelConverter() to support
setting of the XmNtearOffModel resource from resource files.
This allows menus to be torn off and posted permanently.LINKEND="FG-1013-03-7"Figure 3-7  shows xmainwindow with the File pulldown menu displayed.
The techniques for creating all three types of menus
are very similar, but we'll reserve discussion of the other
types until LINKEND="CH-1013-13-1""Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups."ID="FG-1013-03-7"xmainwindow with the File pulldown menu displayedFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="03.07.gif" ID="GC-1013-3-7"Creating a pulldown menu is a four-step process:
ID="IX-1013-3-76"pulldown menucreatingNUMERATION="ARABIC"Create a CascadeButton as a child of the menubar.  This will be
the button in which the user will click in order to pull down the menu.Create an empty menu with XmCreatePulldownMenu() as a child of
the menubar.  This actually
creates a RowColumn with certain resource settings.Create PushButtons or PushButtonGadgets for each menu item,
as children of the pulldown menu.Tell the CascadeButton that just created the ID of the menu, it should pop up.
This can't be done until step 2 is done.In Motif, the RowColumn widget created by XmCreatePulldownMenu()
is called a menu pane, and the buttons contained by that menu
are called menu items.
ID="IX-1013-3-77"menusmenu paneID="IX-1013-3-78"menusmenu itemsThis process sets up the popup widget, but does not put it on the
screen.  Somewhere in your code you need to call
XtManageChild() to pop up the widget.
ID="IX-1013-3-79" SPAN="START"widgetspopping up
This is typically done in the XmNactivateCallback callback
routine of the CascadeButton.
Motif takes care of popping down the menu at the appropriate times
according to its conventions.LINKEND="EX-1013-03-5"Example 3-5 shows the code needed to add a File menu containing only a quit button

}This code sample exactly matches the four steps listed above for
creating a menu.  First it creates the button that pops up the menu,
followed by the menu pane itself, followed by a button that will appear
in the menu.  Finally, it tells fileButton that it should pop up
fileMenu whenever activated.There are several important things to remember about this example.
Note that fileMenu is not managed after it is created,
unlike the widgets in all previous examples.  Motif itself will
manage the widget when it comes time to pop it up.
Also note how, by setting the XmNsubMenuId resource,
ID="IX-1013-3-81"XmNsubMenuId resource
we connect the fileButton widget with fileMenu.
Finally, note that both fileButton and fileMenu
are children of the menubar, while quit is a child of
fileMenu.  This instance hierarchy is important.ID="S2-1013-3-6"Creating a Basic Dialog BoxID="IX-1013-3-82"dialog boxescreatingMotif has even more different types of dialog boxes than

Motif doesn't provide a dialog widget that is ideal for
providing help, since MessageBox provides Help buttons and Cancel
buttons that are normally not needed in Help dialog boxes.A Help button is created just like the fileButton in the

}ID="IX-1013-3-86"popupsexampleAs shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-6"Example 3-6, the first step in creating a Help feature is to
create a CascadeButton widget as a child of the menubar.
Then, you set the XmNmenuHelpWidget resource of the
menubar to tell the menubar that this particular CascadeButton is the Help
button.  This is necessary because the menubar treats the
Help button specially; it is a Motif convention that the
Help button appears at the extreme right of the menubar.
Third, you create the dialog box with XmCreateMessageDialog().
Finally, you register a callback function, here called
ShowHelp, with the
CascadeButton widget.  ShowHelp simply calls
XtManageChild() to put the dialog widget on the screen.
(If you have several dialog widgets, they can all share this callback
function because it doesn't have any code that depends on any
particular type of dialog widget.)If you get a run-time error that says "Error: Attempt to manage a
child when parent is not Composite," it may mean that
you have used XmCreateMessageBox() instead of
XmCreateMessageDialog().
XmCreateMessageBox() creates a widget with the same appearance,
but it does not create the Shell
widget parent that allows the message box to be used as a popup.
This can also happen with file selection boxes, radio boxes,
selection boxes, and check boxes.The parent of the dialog box can be any widget in the
application, since it is only used to determine on which screen to create
the dialog.  However, it is useful to use some consistent
system of parenting, to make it easier to keep track of the purpose
of each dialog.  In this case, the parent is the
CascadeButton widget that pops up the dialog,
getHelp.XmCreateMessageDialog() actually creates two widgets for you, an
OverrideShell and a MessageBox as its child.  The OverrideShell
handles communication with the window manager, and the MessageBox
displays the help text and creates the OK button that pops down the
dialog.  By default, a MessageBox (and most Motif dialogs)
contains three buttons, that read by default OK, Cancel, and Help.
Since we are providing help, we have no need for the Cancel and Help
buttons.  Unfortunately, Motif does not provide a dialog widget
with just the OK button.  But it is easy enough to take the Cancel
and Help widgets off the dialog by unmanaging them.  We get their IDs
with the Motif function XmMessageBoxGetChild(),
and then unmanage them with
XtUnmanageChild().  The MessageBox widget then automatically
centers the OK button.Note that the help text is not specified anywhere in the application
code.  At least until the application is final, it can be specified
in the app-defaults file.

This is because their Shell widgets are child windows of the
root window, not the top-level window of the application, no
matter which widget you supply as parent.
By default in Xt, a child of the root is positioned at the top-left
corner of the screen.  However, Motif automatically positions most
menus and dialog boxes in a suitable location in or over the
application before popping them up.  Dialog boxes or menus that are
not triggered by a mouse button press, though, need to be positioned
by the application.  How to do this will be described in LINKEND="CH-1013-13-1""Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups."LINKEND="FG-1013-03-9"Figure 3-9 shows the widget instance hierarchy of xmainwindow, and

characteristics are not known until just before it is popped up,
you can create the popup shell and widget just before popping it up,
in the callback function or action that pops up the widget.
This technique makes the startup time of the application marginally
faster, but slows the pop up time the first time the popup is used.Popups, and menus in particular, will be described in much more detail
in LINKEND="CH-1013-13-1""Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups."ID="IX-1013-3-92" SPAN="END"widgetspopping upID="IX-1013-3-93" SPAN="END"MainWindow widgetID="IX-1013-3-94" SPAN="END"helpHelp button; creatingID="IX-1013-3-95" SPAN="END"helpHelp dialogue box; creatingID="S1-1013-3-5"More About CallbacksAs you may recall, a callback is a function that your application
wants called in response to a certain occurrence in a certain
widget.  The application simply declares
the callback function and then calls XtAddCallback().
While LINKEND="CH-1013-2-1""Chapter 2, Introduction to the X Toolkit," discussed
the concept of callbacks and demonstrated the most common
use, it did not completely describe all the
useful tricks.  You can pass application data to
callback functions.  You can arrange for more than one
callback function to be called (in a particular order) when the
callback is triggered, and add and remove functions from this list at
will.  You can declare callbacks statically using
a callback list instead of calling XtAddCallback() or
XtAddCallbacks().ID="S2-1013-3-8"Passing Data to Callback FunctionsID="IX-1013-3-96"callbackspassing dataA callback function is called with three arguments:  widget,
client_data, and call_data.The widget argument is necessary if you have registered the
same callback function for two widgets, and you need to know which
widget called the function.
It also may be used in routine ways, such as for the argument of macros.
The application determines the use of client_data,
whereas the widget determines the use of call_data.ID="S3-1013-3-1"The client_data ArgumentID="IX-1013-3-97"global variablesYou may pass a single piece of data as the client_data
argument, or pass a pointer to a structure containing several pieces of
data.  You may ask, "Why bother with passing data to a callback when
I can just declare a global variable?"  For one
thing, it is a general
principle of good C coding to use a global variable only where the
variable is needed in several functions and the arguments would
otherwise prove unwieldy.  Secondly, using the client_data
argument makes clear the purpose of your variable, whereas it is
difficult to trace where a global variable is set or referenced.
However, if you find it necessary to change the client_data
argument in a number of functions in the application, you will need a
global variable anyway, and there is nothing that says you must
use client_data (but be sure to document what you are doing!).LINKEND="EX-1013-03-8"Example 3-8 demonstrates how to pass a single piece of data into a callback function.

}ID="IX-1013-3-100"callbackspassing dataNote that two coding conventions are required by
ANSI C and should be followed, even though many compilers will not
complain if they
are not used.  The first is that all three arguments of the callback
must be declared, even if the trailing ones are not used.  Many
compilers will work fine if unused trailing arguments are omitted from
the definition of the callback function.
The second is that many compilers will automatically cast
XtPointer to the type you want if you declare
the callback function arguments using that type.
The cast on the first line of the PressMe callback
is required by ANSI C.

}ID="S3-1013-3-2"The call_data ArgumentID="IX-1013-3-101"callbackspassing dataID="IX-1013-3-102"callbacksarguments toThe call_data argument is passed in to the callback function
from the widget itself.  This argument's value is described in
the documentation for the widget class unless it is not used.  In
the Motif widgets, this argument is usually a structure named
after the widget that is performing the callback.  For example,
the structure passed by the PushButton widget is
XmPushButtonCallbackStruct.
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-11"Example 3-11 shows this structure.ID="EX-1013-03-11"The XmPushButtonCallbackStruct structuretypedef struct {
    int     reason;
    XEvent  *event;
    int     click_count;
} XmPushButtonCallbackStruct;Every Motif callback structure
ID="IX-1013-3-103"callbacksstructure
contains reason and event fields.
Remember that widgets often have several callback resources.
The reason field tells you which callback resource
was triggered.  For example, the PushButton widget has three
callback resources, each of which has a different reason
value:MARK="BULLET"XmNactivateCallback, a commonly used resource,
triggered when the user presses and releases the first mouse button
on the PushButton.
The callback function invoked is passed
a call_data structure with the reason field set to
XmCR_ACTIVATE.XmNarmCallback resource, which is triggered when the first mouse
button is pressed and held on the PushButton.
The callback function invoked is passed
a call_data structure with the reason field set to
XmCR_ARM.XmNdisarmCallback resource, which is triggered when the first mouse
button is released outside the PushButton.
The callback function invoked is passed
a call_data structure with the reason field set to
XmCR_DISARM.Application callback functions rarely have to read the
reason field since separate functions are usually registered
for the different callback resources.  In other words, an application
that registers callback functions for all three of PushButton's
callback resources would not need to use the reason field in
any of the callback functions unless it registered the same function
for two or more of the callbacks.Most callback functions don't use the event field passed to
the callback function either, but it is potentially useful,
since it contains a lot of data about the user event that triggered
the callback.  If a button press or release triggered the callback,
this event structure will be an XButtonEvent structure.  This
structure can be passed to XmMenuPosition() to position a
menu created with XmCreatePopupMenu(), as will be described in
LINKEND="CH-1013-13-1""Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups." If the triggering event was a key press or release, an
XKeyEvent would be passed.  In some cases it may be useful
to process this event to determine which key was pressed.
Remember that due to Motif's keyboard interface, most callback
functions can be invoked by either a keyboard or a mouse command.
When this is the case, your callback function must be written so that
it can handle either type of event.Other widget sets do not use the call_data argument as
heavily as Motif.  For example, the Athena Widgets rarely use it at all.ID="S2-1013-3-9"Callback ListsID="IX-1013-3-104"callbackscallback listYou may register any number of callback functions for a single
widget callback resource.  In other words, when a callback is triggered
by a user event, all the functions in the current callback list
for that callback for that widget instance will be called, one at a
time.  Multiple callback functions are not needed in many
applications, but can be useful if applied carefully.ID="IX-1013-3-105"callbacks~order ofThere is no guarantee that the functions on a callback list will be
called in the specified order.  Therefore, each callback function
must be independent of all other callback functions on the list.
This dramatically reduces the usefulness of multiple callback functions.Remember that most widgets also have more than one callback list,
each triggered by a different occurrence.  What we are talking about
here is that you can register a series of functions to be called
in response to one occurrence.Let's take an example of how a callback list might be used.
Perhaps you have the functions A, B, and C, and you
need to be able to call them separately in response to events in
three different PushButton widgets, or to call all of them in
response to events in a fourth PushButton widget.  How should we
structure the callback for the fourth PushButton widget?
The first approach is to have a callback list
including the functions A, B, and C.
This is preferred if A, B, and C can be called in any order,
since you can pass a different piece of data into each routine.
The other approach is to register a single callback,
function D, that calls A, B, and C.
ID="IX-1013-3-106"XtRemoveCallbackID="IX-1013-3-107"XtRemoveCallbacks
In this case you are assured that
A, B, and C will be called in the desired order.You can also call the same function more than once in a callback list.
ID="IX-1013-3-108"XtRemoveAllCallbackswarning aboutNever use XtRemoveAllCallbacks().  Widget sets such as
Motif add their own callback functions to many of the widgets,
and depend on these functions to operate properly.ID="IX-1013-3-109"XtAddCallbacksID="IX-1013-3-110"XtRemoveCallbackID="IX-1013-3-111"XtRemoveCallbacksID="IX-1013-3-112"callbacksadding; more than one
One way to add more than one
callback function is to call XtAddCallback() more than once.
Another way is to call XtAddCallbacks(), which takes an
XtCallbackRec array as an argument.  This array is usually
initialized at compile time, as shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-12"Example 3-12.
The
final NULL, NULL entry terminates the list.  (This
particular list registers the functions do_A and then_B,
and passes them both 0 as client_data.)

    {do_A, 0},

};This form of XtCallbackRec list can also be used to replace
a callback list with XtSetValues() (but not to get a
callback list, because Xt compiles the list into an internal form).
An XtCallbackRec list can also be used to register one or
more callbacks when creating a widget.

configured through the resource mechanism.  In addition,
the application itself may have variables
that it wants the user to be able to configure from the
resource databases, even though these variables
have nothing to do with widgets.  These are called application
resources.Application resources are just like widget resources except that they
apply to application code, not to the widgets it creates.ID="IX-1013-3-117"XtGetApplicationResourcesID="IX-1013-3-118"application resourcesadding
There are three steps for adding application resources.
You must:NUMERATION="ARABIC"Create an application data structure containing the variables to be
set via the resource mechanism.Create a resource table defining the type and default value for each
variable.Call XtGetApplicationResources() with pointers to the
application data structure and resource table as arguments.  When this
function returns, the application data structure will contain the
current settings from the resource databases.To demonstrate how to get application resources, we will jump ahead
and describe a portion of the code for the
xbitmap4 bitmap
editor example described in LINKEND="CH-1013-4-1""Chapter 4, An Example Application." Because this application draws into a widget using Xlib, it needs two
colors with which to draw.  The bitmap editor also allows the user to
specify the dimensions of the bitmap in cells, and the size of each
cell in pixels.  And, for general utility, it includes a debug flag
that can be set in a resource file to invoke or ignore debugging code
without recompiling.ID="S2-1013-3-10"The Application Data StructureID="IX-1013-3-119"application resourcesdata structureID="IX-1013-3-120"application resourcesdata structureThe structure type that contains all the application variables to
be set through resources is commonly called AppData.
Once this structure type is declared, memory can be allocated for
a structure called app_data.
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-13"Example 3-13 shows the code that defines the structure type and then allocates memory for the actual structure.ID="EX-1013-03-13"xbitmap: getting application resourcestypedef struct {

referenced throughout the application code using the dot format.  For
example, the value of the debug field of app_data will
be referenced with app_data.debug.ID="S2-1013-3-11"The Resource ListThe resource list looks complicated, but it is easy to understand
and even easier to write because it conforms to
a consistent pattern.  Each field in the application data structure
has an entry in the resource list.  Each resource entry in turn
has seven fields,
which describe the name of the resource, its type and default value, and
various other information.The resource list controls Xt's value conversion facilities.  Since
user resources are always strings, and application data structure fields
can be any type, a conversion may have to take place.  Xt has built-in
converters to convert from string to most common types needed by
applications.  These types are called representation typesID="IX-1013-3-123"XmR resource listsID="IX-1013-3-124"resourcesresource list; XmR
by Xt, and they are indicated by constants starting with XmR
in Motif, or XtR in standard Xt.
The representation type of a string (char *) is
XmRString.  A Motif compound string is XmRXmString.
You control the conversion simply by specifying a resource as a
certain representation type in the resource list.
ID="IX-1013-3-125"representation typesID="IX-1013-3-126"resourcesrepresentation typesIt is possible to represent the same value in several different
representation types.
For example, a color may be represented as an ASCII
color name such as "blue," as a structure containing Red, Green, and
Blue values, or as a pixel value (an index into a colormap).
Also note that a representation type is different from a C-Language
type.
It is also possible for two different representations of something
to both use the same C-Language type.  For example, two hypothetical
representation types might be XtRInch and XtRMeter.
Both represent distances and both would probably be integers or
floating point numbers, but each would have a different value for the
same distance.See LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion," for a description of
the standard representation types, as well as information on how
to write your own converter routine.LINKEND="EX-1013-03-14"Example 3-14 shows the resource list for xbitmap4, followed by a description of each

The first two fields of each entry are the name and class of the

constants to improve compile-time checking, and should be selected from
<Xm/Xm.h> if any there have an appropriate name, or
they can be defined in your application's own include file.
For the debug resource entry, the resource name and class strings

defined in the application's include file as XtNdebug and
XtCDebug.   Note that in this case we have chosen to spell
the symbols XtN instead of XmN.  This is just to
highlight the fact that these are not built-in Motif symbols.
You can use XtN, XmN, or your own prefix.ID="IX-1013-3-133"representation typesID="IX-1013-3-134"resourcesrepresentation typesID="IX-1013-3-135"resourcesresource conversion; aboutID="IX-1013-3-136"stringsStringDefs.h header file
The third field is the representation type.
A representation type is a symbolic constant, beginning with
XtR or XmR, that defines the data type of a resource.
Because user
resource specifications are always in the form of strings while the
actual resources may be of any type, Xt uses resource converters to
convert the string representation to the actual target type.
If necessary, you can define your own representation type in your
application include file, but you will also have to provide Xt with
a way
to convert from string to this type with a type converter function,
as described in LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion".  LINKEND="TB-1013-3-1"Table 3-1 lists the correspondence between some of the representation types
defined in <Xm/Xm.h> and actual C data types and structures.The fourth field, the size of the
representation, is specified using the C macro sizeof with
the actual C type as an argument.  For example, when the representation
type is XmRBoolean, the size field is sizeof(Boolean).The fifth field identifies the place in your application's data
structure where Xt is to place the converted value.  In
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-15"Example 3-15, the structure is called AppData.  This field for the debug
resource entry is specified using the XtOffsetOf() macro as
XtOffsetOf(AppData, debug).  Note that
the field name in the application data structure is often the
same as the resource name, except with all word transitions
marked with an underscore instead of a capital letter.
ID="IX-1013-3-137"XtOffsetOfID="IX-1013-3-138"resourcesdefault value; settingThe sixth field specifies the representation type of the default
value (the seventh field).  Xt has routines for converting data

specify the default value as a string (among other things) and if the
default value is needed Xt will convert it to the representation type
you specified in field three. If the representation type in field
three is not
standard in Xt or Motif, you will have to write the conversion routine that
converts from XmRString to that representation, as described in
LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion." You can also use the special
constant XmRImmediate here, which
indicates that the value in field seven can be used without conversion.
Using XmRImmediate should lead to faster startup.

}ID="IX-1013-3-143"resourcesretrieving; application resourcesBecause Xt automatically converts the user's color
specifications (such as "blue") into the form required by X, it
warns the user when an unknown color is specified.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-7"ID="FN-1013-3-7"That is, if the resource in a database file is specified properly,
but the value is not, Xt will warn the user.  However, if the
resource is not specified properly, Xt has no way
of knowing that the resource was intended to specify a color, and
therefore, no message will be issued.  For example, "*background: grein"will elicit a warning message because grein is an unknown color, but
"*background: green" will not, because the resource identifier is
unknown.  Unknown resource identifiers are simply ignored, because they
could apply to some other widget or even some other application.
Therefore, your code doesn't need to check this kind of validity
for values that Xt or Motif converts.  However, you may need
to check for other kinds of validity of the same values.
For example, you may wish to check that two colors are not
the same by comparing values after conversion.
In this case, only the bitmap dimensions and cell size are checked,
since they are critical
to the application's operation.ID="S1-1013-3-7"Command-line OptionsID="IX-1013-3-144"commandcommand line; optionsoptionsID="IX-1013-3-145"optionscommand lineYou already know that Xt automatically customizes widgets according
to the resource database, but this is not the whole story.
Users often expect command-line arguments for the most
important aspects of an application.  By default, XtAppInitialize()
understands only
a minimal set of command-line arguments; more need to be added so
that application resources and certain widget resources can be set from
the command line.There is no point, however, in trying to make every
widget resource settable from the command line, because that's the
purpose of the resource database.  You should concentrate on the
resources that the user is most likely to want to have different between two
simultaneous instances of the application
(since it is difficult to arrange this with the resource database).Before describing how to define your own command-line arguments, we
need to describe what command-line
arguments XtAppInitialize() already handles.ID="S2-1013-3-13"Standard Command-line OptionsID="IX-1013-3-146"optionsstandardID="IX-1013-3-147"options-xrmFirst of all, XtAppInitialize() recognizes the -xrm option for
setting any widget or application resource.  For example:ID="SC-1013-3-5"spike%  xhello -xrm '*background: blue'This command-line argument sets all widget resources and application
resources that are named background to blue.
This option style is awkward.  Not only is it long, but csh
users must quote the string with right-handed single quotes
so that the asterisk (*) is not interpreted by the shell.ID="IX-1013-3-148"XtAppInitializeXtAppInitialize() also understands some command-line
options that were considered so basic that they should be the same
for all applications.  The above -xrm command line can be replaced by:

table, which is necessary to show the user an error in a parameter.
Furthermore, this table is in the source for Xt
and therefore not available online to some Toolkit users.
However, this parse table is not expected to change radically in new
releases.  Therefore it can probably be safely copied from this document
into application code to provide a synopsis of valid options, if
desired.  Most current applications simply say "This application
understands all standard X Toolkit command-line options."

Note that you cannot override the standard options by
providing options with the same names in your own parsing table.
If you try this, your options with the same names will simply not
be set to the values specified on the command line.  Instead, the
standard options will be set to these values.  This was a design
decision in Xt, one of the few cases where a user-interface policy is
enforced.  Uniformity in this basic area was deemed more valuable
than flexibility.Also note that there is no way to instruct Xt to interpret more than
one argument format for the same option.  For example, you cannot
arrange for -size 3 and -size3 both to work.ID="IX-1013-3-200"argumentsargcID="IX-1013-3-201"argumentsargvXtAppInitialize() removes all the arguments it recognizes
(including those in your options table) from argv and
argc.  If all goes well, only the application name will remain
in argv, and argc will equal one.
It is important to check whether there is more than
one argument left after XtAppInitialize() has returned.
Command-line options that XtAppInitialize() doesn't recognize will
be left in argv and argc.  This is
your chance to catch this error and tell the user.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-9"ID="FN-1013-3-9"You can, of course, intentionally treat the arguments remaining after
XtAppInitialize() as filenames or other pieces of data.ID="IX-1013-3-202"syntax functionsID="IX-1013-3-203"optionshandling errors inID="IX-1013-3-204"error handlingXtAppInitialize
The Syntax function shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-16"Example 3-16 demonstrates code that informs the user of the proper syntax and the option that was not understood.
(In response to incorrect command-line options, UNIX programs
traditionally print only the correct calling
sequence.  However, you can be even nicer to the user by printing
the option or options that were in error, by passing argv and
argc into your Syntax function, as is done in
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-16"Example 3-16.Experienced UNIX programmers will note that Xt applications can (but
usually don't) use the single-letter command-line arguments mandated
by POSIX and the System V Interface Definition.  As mentioned
earlier, Xt automatically matches any unique abbreviation for
any command-line option.  For example, by default the -display option
can be specified as -d, but only if you haven't included any other
option in the options table that also begins with d.  You can define the
meaning of single-letter options simply by including them verbatim in
the options table.  In other words, if you specify that
-d turns on a debugging resource, Xt will no
longer try to match any other, longer option that also begins with
d.Note that the argc and argv arguments of
XtAppInitialize() are in the
same order as in the call to main.  This is the opposite
order of arrays and array lengths throughout other Motif, Xt and Xlib
routine calls.
Also note that the address of argc, not argc itself,
is passed to XtAppInitialize().  This is so that
XtAppInitialize() can decrement the count to reflect recognized
options.  Watch out for these snags.

resources need to be hardcoded to make sure that an application
will run properly regardless of user configuration.
This is particularly true of widget geometry resources and constraints.
For example, it is easy to make a mistake with Form widget constraints
such that some important widget is hidden behind others.You prevent user customization of particular resources by setting
them in the calls to XtVaCreateManagedWidget() or
XtCreateManagedWidget(), using
a varargs list or an argument list as was shown in
XtVaSetValues() and XtSetValues() calls in LINKEND="S1-1013-7-4"Section 7.4, "The set_values Method." When you use a Motif widget creation function such as
XmCreateMenuBar(), the easiest way to hardcode that widget's
resources is to follow the creation call with a call to XtVaSetValues().
This section will review those techniques and show a few more tricks.When resources are set in the calls to create
widgets, the application can still
modify these resources any time later using XtVaSetValues() or
XtSetValues().  Therefore,
this is hardcoding only from the user's perspective.
Also note that Xt will not tell the user
that you have hardcoded certain resources--your application
documentation should do this.The time to hardcode widget resources is when development of an
application is almost finished,
because until then the resource settings are still in flux and it
is quicker to edit the app-defaults file than it is to
recompile the application.Motif itself prevents user customization of certain resources,
because it does not allow them to be set from resource files.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-10"ID="FN-1013-3-10"Unfortunately, exactly which Motif resources can't be set from
resource files is poorly documented.  One sure sign is when
Motif prints an error message telling you that there is no
converter for that resource.
These resources must be set in the code if they are to be set at all.
This is unfortunate because these resource settings can't be debugged
in the usual way, by modifying the app-defaults files or using
editres (see Chapter 14).  This leads to time-consuming
recompilation.Selecting which resources to hardcode is something we can't help
ID="IX-1013-3-209"resourceshardcoding; disadvantages
you with, because there isn't enough experience to go on yet.
Some application developers will hardcode almost everything, while
others will hardcode almost nothing.  Only time will tell where the
proper balance lies.  For example, there is a tradeoff between
hardcoding strings such as "Quit" so that the user can't change them,
and setting them in the app-defaults file so that they can be
easily changed for operation in a different language.ID="S2-1013-3-15"Using the Varargs InterfacesID="IX-1013-3-210"argumentsvarargsSetting widget resources in XtVaCreateManagedWidget() is
the cleanest and most powerful way to do it.  You have already seen
the style of call shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-17"Example 3-17, but pay particular attention to the
XtVaTypedArg entry.  This example also shows the special
technique required to set a Motif compound string in the code.

      .
      .
}The standard varargs list entry is a resource name/value pair.
The value must be already converted into the type required for that
resource (documented on the widget's reference page).
XtVaTypedArg (not Xm...) is a special symbol used just
ID="IX-1013-3-212"XtVaTypedArgused with compound strings
before a resource
name, which, when encountered, indicates that the next four arguments
specify a resource that needs to be converted.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-11"ID="FN-1013-3-11"Note that XtVaTypedArg does not begin with Xm.
It is a symbol defined by Xt.
In
LINKEND="EX-1013-03-17"Example 3-17, the value "red" needs to be converted into a pixel value, which is the
index to the colormap register that contains the correct RGB values to
display on the screen.  The argument XmNbackground is the
resource to be set.  XmRString is the type of the value to be
converted.  The
final two arguments are the pointer to the value (or the pointer to
the pointer to the value if not a string) and the size of the value
pointed to in bytes.
XtVaTypedArg can be used to convert any string that is valid
in a resource file but is otherwise difficult to set in the source file.
But don't use XtVaTypedArg unnecessarily, since it adds
overhead.The varargs interfaces will also accept an arglist as one
item in the list, using the symbol XtVaNestedList as
the resource name.  XtVaNestedList allows you to
create one argument list and pass it to
a series of widget creation routines, instead of listing all the same
resource settings in each widget creation routine.  For more details on
this, see LINKEND="CH-1013-10-1""Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion."There is some extra
overhead involved in using the varargs interfaces because they
massage the arguments into an argument list and call
XtCreateWidget(), XtCreateManagedWidget(),
XtSetValues(), or XtGetValues().
However, the added convenience seems worth it.
Furthermore, the XtVaTypedArg feature is not supported in the
ArgList style of call (described in the next section).Unless you use the XtVaTypedArg feature, no diagnostic is
printed when you specify a resource value incorrectly in the argument
list.  Therefore, make sure you specify the resource values correctly,
and recognize this as a possible place to begin looking for bugs.
(This is another reason to hardcode resources only when the application
ID="IX-1013-3-213"resourceshardcoding; advantages
is almost ready for release.  If you do it all at once in a methodical
fashion, you are less likely to make mistakes than if you are always adding,
subtracting, and changing values in the argument lists.)If you use the varargs style of arguments, but forget to type the Va
in the function name, you can get various types of errors.  If you
specify resources in the call, you will get a core dump at run
time, but you can detect the problem with lint, which
ID="IX-1013-3-214"lint
will note the function as having a variable number of arguments.
If you don't specify resources in the call,
the application will run but you will get the message:Warning: argument count > 0 on NULL argument listID="S2-1013-3-16"Using the Argument List InterfacesID="IX-1013-3-215"argumentsargument lists; aboutWidget resources can also be hardcoded by creating an argument list
containing the resources to be set and their values, and passing
it to XtCreateManagedWidget().  This method of setting resources
is less convenient that the varargs technique just described, but
it was the only way until R4, and therefore many existing
applications use it.ID="IX-1013-3-216"argumentsArg structureAn argument list is just an array of Arg structures, of
the same type as you set up to call XtSetValues() or
XtGetValues().  Once set, this array
is used as an argument to XtCreateManagedWidget().
Each Arg structure contains a resource/value pair.  Attributes
specified here override the same ones specified from the command line

the sensitivity of a PushButton widget and its callback list.  Sensitivity is a good thing to hardcode
for PushButton widgets, because if accidentally set by the user
it could disable an application.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-12"ID="FN-1013-3-12"ID="IX-1013-3-220"sensitivitySensitivity is a basic resource of all widgets.  When set to True,
the default, a widget accepts input and operates normally.  When False,
a widget displays itself in gray (or otherwise indicates insensitivity)
and does not act on user input.  The purpose of sensitivity is to allow
the application to
disable certain commands when they are not valid.
If sensitivity were left configurable, the user could turn it off on
some widgets and effectively cripple an application.
It is hard to imagine the user doing this by accident, but
it is not worth taking a gamble.
The callback list cannot be specified by the user anyway; setting 
it here is just an alternative to calling XtAddCallback().ID="IX-1013-3-221"XtArgValID="IX-1013-3-222"portability

      .The XtSetArg() method has three advantages over static initialization:MARK="BULLET"It moves the code that sets the argument list closer to where
it is really used in the call to create a widget.It allows run-time value modification using the same method.The same storage can be used for multiple argument lists.The disadvantages of the XtSetArg() method are as follows:MARK="BULLET"It performs all assignments at run time, which slows startup slightly.It is possible to try to set more arguments than
space has been allocated for, leading to a core dump.It is possible to misplace the counter increment, leading to improper
operation.An argument list and a counter variable must be kept until the call
to create the widget instance; the static method requires keeping only
the argument list.It may waste a small amount of storage since the argument list array
is usually initialized larger than the required size.Lots of XtSetArg() calls make for ugly code.As you can see, these differences are mostly subjective.
However, the varargs interfaces have many of the advantages of the
ID="IX-1013-3-235"varargs interfacesadvantages and disadvantagesXtSetArg() method, but none of its disadvantages.  The only
disadvantage of the varargs interfaces is the slight overhead they
add.  You may use whichever method you prefer, or some combination.ID="S3-1013-3-4"Merging Argument ListsID="IX-1013-3-236"XtMergeArgListsXtMergeArgLists() takes two argument lists and counts all
arguments, allocates the storage for a single argument list big
enough to hold them, and stores all the entries from both in the

resulting argument count (or can add the original counts).ID="S1-1013-3-9"More About Application ContextsID="IX-1013-3-237" SPAN="START"application contextsID="IX-1013-3-238"application contextsaboutWe have used application contexts in the examples so far, but
not discussed what they really are or what they are for.An application context is a structure maintained by Xt
that stores all the data associated with the application,
including the functions registered by the application and other
information about the application.  Primarily, its purpose is to
allow Xt applications
to run without modification on certain operating systems
that do not have a separate address space for each process.  These
systems include
the Xerox Cedar environment, the Symbolics Genera environment,
and the TI Explorer system.  Although systems like this are not
common, the goal of all X software in C is to be portable to any system
that supports C.LINKEND="FN-1013-3-13"ID="FN-1013-3-13"It is almost a maxim that there is no such thing as portable software, only
software that has been ported.  The goal (and more or less the
reality) of X is that the porting process should be much easier than it has
traditionally been, and, most important, that only
one version of a particular piece of software should need to be maintained.
The various idiosyncrasies of particular compilers can be dealt with
using conditional preprocessor directives (#ifdef).  X features were designed
specifically to provide ways to handle differences in screens and keyboards.
The application context is an effort to provide a way to handle odd operating
systems.Why then is the XtAppContext exposed in the programming
interface?
ID="IX-1013-3-239"application contextscreating
It is possible, though difficult, to create more than one
application context within a
single program.  This is rarely done and its implications are
complex, so we will reserve discussion of it until LINKEND="S1-1013-14-10"Section 14.10, "Application Contexts."The important thing to remember is that for maximum portability, you
need to use the versions of routines that begin with XtApp
instead of those that don't.  For instance, use
XtAppInitialize() instead of XtInitialize()
and XtAppMainLoop(), not XtMainLoop().Of the routines you have seen so far in this book, only
XtVaAppInitialize(), XtAppInitialize(),
XtAppMainLoop(), and XtAppAddActions()
use explicit application contexts.  The complete list of routines
that have equivalents is presented in LINKEND="S1-1013-14-10"Section 14.10, "Application Contexts."Throughout this book we will continue to use the routines that use
the explicit application context.

ID="IX-1013-4-1" SPAN="START"BitmapEdit widget
(which is actually developed in Chapter 6, Inside a Widget).  Then, two refined
versions are developed, each demonstrating additional Toolkit programming
techniques.  Finally, the same application is shown as it would
be written if the bitmap editor were implemented in an
application window rather than with the BitmapEdit widget.Enough of these trivial programs!  Now for an (almost) real
application.  This chapter describes the development of a bitmap
editor.  Although it is simple, it can be easily extended to
be quite powerful without any new techniques.We will show several versions of xbitmap,
beginning with a simple version that assumes the existence of
a BitmapEdit widget (which will actually be developed in Chapter 6, Inside a Widget,
and Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods).  Subsequent versions add two widgets that display the
bitmap in small scale (one normal, one reverse video),
and finally implement the same application without the use of the
specialized BitmapEdit widget.These examples will demonstrate the techniques
described in Chapter 2, Introduction to the X Toolkit and Motif, and Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets, as they would appear in a
real application, and will bring up a number of new topics:MARK="BULLET"The
initial version introduces the bitmap editor application,
and demonstrates the way the application can access the data within the
BitmapEdit widget using a public function defined by the widget class.
It also further demonstrates the most common method of linking
widgets with application code: using callbacks.The second version demonstrates two ways of adding
the small-scale bitmaps, one using a standard widget
and one drawing into a Core widget from the application.
This allows us to introduce actions and translations,
another (less commonly used) way to link widgets with application code.The third version
does not use the BitmapEdit widget, but instead implements its
features by drawing into a
Primitive widget.  This demonstrates one way to prototype features
while learning to write your own widget.  It also allows us to
describe the code necessary to implement the bitmap editor so that
you will already understand this code when you see it in
the internal framework of a widget described in
Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.  Note, however, that the proper way to
implement functionality of this level of complexity (or greater)
is to write a widget.Many applications have at least one custom window for which
no existing widget will suffice.
This chapter demonstrates several of the ways to implement
such a window,
and describes the tradeoffs between the different options.
Features can be added from the application code by
building on a Motif DrawingArea widget, or creating
a Core or Primitive widget to draw into.  They can also be
implemented by creating a custom
widget.  By the end of Chapters 6 and 7, you will have seen how to
implement this application entirely with existing widgets
and application code, how to implement it using custom widgets,
and how to implement a mixture of the two.ID="S1-1013-4-1"xbitmap1: Bitmap Editor Using a BitmapEdit WidgetID="IX-1013-4-2"xbitmap applicationMost application programming is done entirely using widgets written

button which simply prints on the standard output an array of ones
and zeroes representing the set and unset bits in the bitmap.  (Code

BitmapEditGetArray gets a character array which represents
the contents of the bitmap being edited, and the dimensions of the

print out the bitmap (or write it to a file).
Although these values are widget resources that can
be queried with XtGetValues(), this function makes it more
convenient.  Several Motif widgets also provide
public functions to make it more convenient to set or get resources or

Some widget public functions like BitmapEditGetArray are
provided simply because they are more convenient to use than calling
XtSetValues() or XtGetValues().
Others are supplied by a widget class that wants certain data to
be readable or writable by the application, but for some reason does
not want the data both readable and writable as would be the case
if it were a resource.  Sometimes a widget class has
features that it wants controllable from the application but never
user-customizable (because they are meaningless at startup, for
example), and therefore it provides a function for setting them.ID="S2-1013-4-1"XBitmap1 App-defaults FileLINKEND="EX-1013-04-2"Example 4-2 shows the app-defaults file for xbitmap1.

is designed to allow you to draw into it; the DrawingArea widget.In addition to displaying the bitmap in blown-up, editable form,
a bitmap editor should display the bitmap in true scale, how
the bitmap really looks when displayed on the screen.  It is customary
to present this bitmap in both normal and reverse video, and update it
every time the user toggles a cell in the enlarged bitmap.
LINKEND="FG-1013-04-2"Figure 4-2 shows the appearance of the application with this feature added.LINKEND="FN-1013-4-2"ID="FG-1013-04-2"xbitmap2: true-scale normal and reverse bitmaps addedFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="04.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-4-2"ID="FN-1013-4-2"You may notice that we have abandoned the
MainWindow used in xbitmap1, and instead used
PanedWindow as the main window of the application.
This is because there is no easy way to fit the two additional
small pixmap widgets into the layout scheme of MainWindow.
(We originally intended to place the small pixmaps in the menubar,
but it can accept only CascadeButton widgets.  This restriction is
intended to enforce the convention that the menubar is only for menus.)There are three ways to implement the small pixmap widgets.
(All of them would look the same to the user.)
One approach is to use the Label widget,
ID="IX-1013-4-13"Label widget
which can display a pixmap instead of a string.  However, it is
then difficult to make the Label widget redraw the pixmap
each time a cell is toggled.  This is difficult because we are
changing the contents of the pixmap (by drawing into it) without the
Label widget's knowledge; therefore the widget does not know to
redraw itself.
The only obvious way to tell Label to redraw is to clear the widget's
window; this generates an Expose event and forces the widget
to redraw itself.  However, this results in a flashing effect that
is unacceptable.  You can avoid flashing by synthesizing
an Expose event (creating an
XExposeEvent structure and filling it with values) and sending
it to the Label widget using XSendEvent().  This is a bit of
a kludge but it works.  If Label provided a public function
called XmLabelRedrawPixmap, we could more cleanly correct the
flashing bug.  Although adding this function to the widget code would
be easy, we could no longer call the remaining widget class Label;
we would be creating a new widget class.Another way to display the small pixmaps is to use a DrawingArea
ID="IX-1013-4-14"DrawingArea widget
widget, which is an empty widget that provides callbacks in which you
can place drawing code.  DrawingArea is useful for building simple
custom windows that don't have complicated graphics or user input.
This technique is implemented in xbitmap2.The third possibility is to draw
ID="IX-1013-4-15"Core widgetID="IX-1013-4-16"Primitive widget
into a Core or Primitive widget.  This would use code very similar
to that in xbitmap2, but would link the application code with
the widget using actions and translations instead of with callbacks.
We will be demonstrating this technique in xbitmap3 as an
introduction to translations and actions.ID="S2-1013-4-2"Exposure StrategyThe redrawing technique used in xbitmap2 works as follows.
Two pixmaps (off-screen drawable areas) are created to record the
current state of each bitmap.  Whenever a cell is toggled, a pixel in
each pixmap is changed by drawing into each pixmap.  Then each
entire pixmap is copied into the corresponding widget.  The same
routine that copies from pixmap to widget is used whenever the
widgets become exposed.
LINKEND="FG-1013-04-3"Figure 4-3 illustrates this technique.ID="FG-1013-04-3"Application draws into Pixmap and copies it to widget windowFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="04.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-4-3"In the actual code, two single-plane pixmaps are created during
application startup, the same size as the bitmap displayed in the
BitmapEdit widget.
Each of the two bitmap display areas is implemented with a
DrawingArea widget.  DrawingArea provides a callback resource
called XmNexposeCallback.  The application calls
XtAddCallback() to register a function with each of the two
widgets for the XmNexposeCallback resource.  This function,
called RedrawSmallPicture,
copies from the pixmaps into the widget's window.  This function
takes care of redrawing the widgets whenever exposure occurs, and it
also can be called whenever a cell is toggled.  The BitmapEdit widget
has an XtNtoggleCallback resource.  The function registered for
this widget and resource draws into the two pixmaps, and then
calls RedrawSmallPicture to copy the updated pixmap
information to the window (alternately, it could draw directly into
window instead of copying from the pixmap).Three new routines are needed:
RedrawSmallPicture, SetUpThings, and
CellToggled.  These three routines are primarily composed of
Xlib calls that set up for and perform graphics.
The RedrawSmallPicture routine copies
a pixmap into a widget, SetUpThings creates the pixmaps and
the GCs (introduced in the next subsection, 4.2.2) needed to draw into
these pixmaps, and CellToggled is a
callback function registered with the BitmapEdit widget that updates
the pixmaps whenever a cell is toggled.  Code is also added to
main to create the two DrawingArea widgets and
register RedrawSmallPicture with them.
We'll show these routines one at a time.

}ID="IX-1013-4-20"DrawingArea widgetdrawing from applicationID="IX-1013-4-21"drawinginto DrawingArea widgetThe main routine registers RedrawSmallPicture
as the XmNexposeCallback function for each DrawingArea
widget.
It also registers CellToggled
as the XtNtoggleCallback for the BitmapEdit widget, to be
called whenever a bitmap cell is toggled.SetUpThings uses Xlib calls to create the pixmap that
will be used as an off-screen copy of what will be displayed in
the DrawingArea widgets.  SetUpThings also creates GCs
that will be used to draw into these pixmaps.
CellToggled does the drawing, and
RedrawSmallPicture performs the copying.
These routines are shown in the next section, which describes
how graphics work in Xt programs.ID="S2-1013-4-3"Graphics from the ApplicationID="IX-1013-4-22"drawingaboutID="IX-1013-4-23"graphics contextsaboutID="IX-1013-4-24"GCsgraphics contextsDrawing in the X Window System is done by creating a graphics context
(GC) that specifies such things as colors and line widths, and then
calling a drawing routine that specifies what shape is to be drawn.
These two steps are basic to X and required in programs written in
any language with or without a toolkit.  For example, the call to
draw a line specifies only the start and endpoints of the line.  The
GC specifies everything else about how the server will actually draw
this line.ID="IX-1013-4-25"graphics contextsreasons forA GC is a server-side object that must be created by the application.
The purpose of the GC is to cache on
the server side information about how graphics are to be executed by
the server, so that this information doesn't have to be sent over the
network with every graphics call.  If X did not have GCs, every
graphics call would have many arguments and this would waste
network time (and be annoying to program).  Instead, you
create a small number of GCs before drawing (in the startup phase of
the application). Each represents a particular color or line style
you will need to draw with at some point. You then specify one of these
GCs in each call to draw.  For example, to draw text and be able to
highlight it at will, it is customary to create two GCs, one for drawing
in white on black, and one for drawing in black on white (where
colors can be substituted for black and white on color screens).Once created, a GC is referred to by its ID, of type GC.
This ID is specified in calls to draw using that GC.ID="IX-1013-4-26"XCreateGC Xlib functionID="IX-1013-4-27"XtGetGC
From the application, the Xlib routine XCreateGC() is usually
used to create GCs.  Xt also provides the XtGetGC() routine for
creating GCs, but it is typically used only inside widget code
when there could be many of the same GCs created.  XtGetGC() is
very similar to XCreateGC(), except that it arranges for
GCs to be shared among widgets (within one application).
XtGetGC() will be described in LINKEND="S1-1013-5-1"Section 5.1, "The Remaining Motif Widgets and Gadgets."In xbitmap2, the SetUpThings routine is responsible
for creating two pixmaps that act as off-screen drawing surfaces, and
two GCs that will be used to draw and undraw pixels in the pixmaps.
Whenever the DrawingArea widgets need to be updated, the pixmaps are copied
ID="IX-1013-4-28"DrawingArea widgetupdating
into the widgets.  This is only one possible exposure-handling
approach.  Another is to draw the required points directly into the
DrawingArea widgets each time they need to be updated, keeping a record of
the drawn points so that the entire widget can be redrawn in case
of exposure.
LINKEND="EX-1013-04-4"Example 4-4 shows SetUpThings, which creates
pixmap and GCs and then initializes the pixmaps.ID="EX-1013-04-4"xbitmap2: creating pixmaps and GCsstatic void

}Notice that GCs can only be used on windows or pixmaps with
the same depth as the window or pixmap that is passed in the call to create
the GC.  In this case, the pixmaps created contain only one plane,
even when running on a server with a color screen.  These pixmaps
are passed to XCreateGC() to set the depth of the GCs.
These GCs can only be used to draw into the single plane pixmaps.  As
you will see in
LINKEND="EX-1013-04-6"Example 4-6, a separate GC
(the default GC) is used to copy from the pixmaps into the windows,
since on color screens the windows have multiple planes.
(You know you have done this incorrectly if you get an error only on
color screens.)ID="IX-1013-4-29"drawingaboutXt does not provide drawing calls of its own.  You must call Xlib
directly to draw.  An Xlib drawing routine is known as a
primitive.  Under X, text is drawn by a graphics
primitive, just as lines, arcs, and other graphics are drawn.ID="IX-1013-4-30"colorID="IX-1013-4-31"pixel valuesabout
Colors are normally specified by the user as strings such as
"blue," but the X server understands colors only when specified as
numbers called pixel
values.  A pixel value is used as an index to a lookup table called a
colormap, which contains values for the RGB (red-green-blue) primaries
used to generate colors on the screen.
However, a particular pixel value does not necessarily
always map to the same color, even when run twice on the same system,
because the contents of the colormap are configurable on most color systems.
The wide variation of graphics hardware that X supports has required
that the design of color handling in X be very flexible and very
complex.ID="IX-1013-4-32"converterscolor name to pixel valueFortunately, as long as your widget or application requires only a small
number of colors, and you do not particularly care whether the colors
you get are exactly the colors you requested, Xt provides a simplified
interface.  It hides the actual Xlib calls involved in the Resource
Manager's converter
routines.  As described in Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets, if you specify application resources for colors in a resource list, Xt
will automatically convert color names specified as resource settings
into pixel values.  If you need to do more advanced color
handling, then you will need to make Xlib calls yourself.  For a
description of Xlib's color handling, see Chapter 7, Color,
in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.xbitmap1 works either in
color or monochrome,
since the widgets it creates can have their color set by
resources.  All of xbitmap2 except the small pixmaps we have
been implementing also support color.
To support color in the small pixmaps
takes more work.  We would need to add application resources to
get the pixel values that will be set into the GCs used when
drawing, as described in LINKEND="S1-1013-3-6"Section 3.6, "Application Resources."LINKEND="EX-1013-04-5"Example 4-5 shows the CellToggled routine.  As you may
recall, this routine is a callback function registered with the
BitmapEdit widget, to be called whenever a cell is toggled.ID="EX-1013-04-5"xbitmap2: the CellToggled routine/* ARGSUSED */

    RedrawSmallPicture(bitmap_stuff.showReverseBitmap,
            cur_info->newx, cur_info->newy);
}Note that BitmapEdit passes a structure called
BitmapEditPointInfo into the callback function as an argument.
This structure is defined in the public include file,
BitmapEdit.h, and it provides the information necessary to keep
the small bitmaps displaying the same pattern as BitmapEdit.  The
fields of BitmapEditPointInfo are the mode (whether drawn or
undrawn) and the coordinates of the point toggled.
The CellToggled routine draws points into the pixmaps
according to the information passed in, and then calls
RedrawSmallPicture to copy the pixmaps into each Core widget.The first line of CellToggled casts the generic pointer
info into the structure type defined by BitmapEdit,
BitmapEditPointInfo.  Under most compilers this can also be
done (perhaps more clearly) by declaring the info argument as type
BitmapEditPointInfo in the first place.  However, ANSI C
compilers require a cast.The RedrawSmallPicture routine is shown in

The use of one of two Xlib routines, depending on the depth of the
screen, is an optimization.  XCopyArea() is faster, but can be
used for this job only on monochrome displays, because the pixmaps
used here are one plane deep on all displays and must be translated
into multiple planes with XCopyPlane() on color displays.

Xlib programming, not Xt programming, so we will not take the space
to describe it.
If you are curious, the complete code for xbitmap5, which
both reads and writes bitmap files, is shown
in Appendix E, The xbitmap Application.ID="S1-1013-4-3"xbitmap3: Another Way to Create a Custom WindowID="IX-1013-4-37" SPAN="START"xbitmap applicationxbitmap3 exampleID="IX-1013-4-38"DrawingArea widgetThe small bitmaps added in the last
section provided a simple example of making a custom window by
creating a DrawingArea widget and drawing into it from the
application.  DrawingArea also provides a callback for
keyboard and pointer (mouse) input, so that you can implement
simple user response from the application.  However, you will quickly
find that to implement a more complicated custom window you need
more control than DrawingArea gives you.The next technique to consider for implementing features not
supported by any existing widget is to
add features to an empty widget such as Core or Primitive using
actions and translations.  This
is simpler than writing a widget to do the same thing.  It also uses
less memory because you do not create a whole new widget class.
This section describes how to implement the small pixmaps that way.
But first, there are some new concepts involved.ID="S2-1013-4-5"ActionsSo far in the book we have used callbacks to link widgets with
application code.
When you are implementing a custom window, callbacks are useless
because they are defined by each widget class, and none of the
existing widget classes has the callbacks or features that you need.Therefore, you need to use a different technique for linking
application code with widget code: the combination of actions and
translations.  You can use actions to add features to a Primitive
or Core widget.  (Actions are also used inside widget code to
implement widget features.)The action and callback techniques for linking the application
with the user interface differ in
the way that the registered function is invoked.
For callbacks, the trigger is an abstract occurrence defined by the
widget, which may or may not be event
related.  When this happens, the routines on one of a widget's
callback lists
are invoked by the widget code, using a call to XtCallCallbacks()
or XtCallCallbackList().
ID="IX-1013-4-39"XtCallCallbacks
Actions, on the other hand, are invoked directly by Xt's translation
mechanism, as the result of an event combination.In xbitmap3 we will make the RedrawSmallPicture function
into an action function instead of a callback function (this means
just giving it different arguments).  Then we need to
arrange for Xt to call RedrawSmallPicture whenever one
of the Primitive widgets becomes exposed.
The general procedure for arranging this is the
same as in xbitmap2--you register the function during the setup
phase of the application, and then Xt will call it in response to
Expose events.  Registering an action, though, is
quite different from registering a callback.To register the action, you first declare an actions table,
which maps action name strings to action function pointers.  Then you
must register the actions table with Xt by calling
XtAppAddActions().  Finally
ID="IX-1013-4-40"XtAppAddActionsID="IX-1013-4-41"actionsXtAppAddActions
you create a translation table and store it in the
app-defaults file or hardcode it in the application.
A translation table is a widget resource which contains a mapping
between events or event sequences and action names.
LINKEND="FG-1013-04-4"Figure 4-4 shows a translation table and an action table, and shows how each is used in the process of mapping events to action function calls.
(The format of these two tables is described in the following sections and
in Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators.)
This two-stage mapping is necessary so that translations can be
specified in resource files.  Since resource files contain
only strings, a translation specified in a resource file can only
translate an event into an action name.  The action table, which
can only be specified in the code, translates the action name into
the actual action function pointer.ID="FG-1013-04-4"Two-stage mapping with translation table and action tableFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="04.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-4-4"When an event arrives in a particular widget, Xt searches that
widget's translation table resource.  If that event is not found
in the table, Xt does nothing.  If the event is found, the matching
action name is searched for in the action table.  
If the action name is found, the corresponding action function is called.We'll describe the format of the action table and translation table,
using xbitmap3 as an example.ID="S3-1013-4-1"The Actions TableID="IX-1013-4-42"actions tableformatThe format of an actions table is defined as
follows:ID="SC-1013-4-1"typedef struct _XtActionsRec{
    char *string;
    XtActionProc proc;
} XtActionsRec;By convention, the string and the function name are identical,
and begin with uppercase letters,
as in the following example:

static XtActionsRec actions[] = {
    {"RedrawSmallPicture", RedrawSmallPicture},
    /* {"Quit", Quit}, */
};The entry that is commented out in the action table shows how additional
action functions would be specified in the table if they were needed.
xbitmap3 needs only one action function.
In xbitmap4 you will see a practical example of multiple action
functions.Action names and action functions should not start with Xt or xt:
these are reserved for the Intrinsics.LINKEND="EX-1013-04-8"Example 4-8 shows the code from bitmap3 that
creates the action table and registers it with XtAppAddActions().

of that widget class.
Actions added with XtAppAddActions(), on the other hand, are
global to the application context, and therefore usable by any widget
instance of any class in the application.  Which widgets they
are actually used with is defined by the translation table, as described
below.The names of widget class actions and application actions do not
conflict.  For example, if an application were to define an action called
Move, and some widget class in Motif already has an action by
that name, the two actions would not conflict with each other.When you map the action to events in a particular widget
(using a translation table), the same is true, with a slight caveat.
If you write an action called Move, and the widget you install
it on already has a Move action, your version will be ignored.
This implies that you are trying to replace a widget action with your
own, and this is not allowed.  You have to write a subclass of the
widget to replace a widget action.ID="S3-1013-4-2"Format of an Action FunctionID="IX-1013-4-48"actionsaction proc formatID="IX-1013-4-49"XtActionProcAn action function is just a pointer to a function with four

}Compare this version of RedrawSmallPicture to the
callback version in
LINKEND="EX-1013-04-8"Example 4-8.
Action functions are directly passed the event structure that
describes the event that triggered the action, in this case an
XExposeEvent structure.  This structure contains the
position and dimensions of the area that was exposed.
This version of RedrawSmallPicture copies
only the necessary parts of the pixmap to refresh the areas that
are exposed.The callback version shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-04-8"Example 4-8 copies the entire pixmap to the
widget regardless of which part of the widget was exposed.  This
is slightly inefficient but the difference is not noticeable when
the pixmap is small.
Under Motif, but not Athena, callback functions are passed
the event structure as part of a larger structure,
which is passed as the
call_data argument (for example
XmAnyCallbackStruct).
Therefore, you have access to the event structure from within both
callbacks and actions.However, be aware that if you are allowing user configuration of
be called with different kinds of events.  You should at least check
the event type in the action routine and print an appropriate message
if the user has arranged to call the action with the wrong type of
event.  We'll show how to do this in Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators.Note that for true ANSI C portability, all four arguments to the action
function must be declared, even though many compilers allow you
to leave off trailing arguments that are not referenced in the function.
If some of the arguments are not used, you
should be sure to include the lint comment /* ARGSUSED */.ID="IX-1013-4-50"eventsas argument of actionID="IX-1013-4-51"actionscontrasted with callbacksID="IX-1013-4-52"callbackscontrasted with actions
One difference between action functions and callback
functions is that, unlike callbacks, there is no argument provided
for passing in application data.  You can only
pass application data into an action function through global
variables.ID="S2-1013-4-6"TranslationsID="IX-1013-4-53" SPAN="START"translationsOnce you have an action table registered, those actions are
ready to be used by any widget in the application.  But which
widgets will they be used in, and which will trigger them?
Translations determine these things.You need to set a translation table resource, XmNtranslations,
on any widget you want to be able to call an application action.
In the case of xbitmap3, we want RedrawSmallPicture
to be called when Expose events occur in the widgets that are
displaying the small pixmaps.  This means that we need to set the
XmNtranslations resource on those two widgets, and the
value of the resource should be a translation that maps an
Expose event into a RedrawSmallPicture call.

This translation table shows a number of useful techniques, which
is described in full detail in Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators:MARK="BULLET"How to detect a button press followed by a release (second line).How to invoke two successive actions in response to an event
sequence (second line).How to detect a double click (lines 3 and 4).How to detect the press of a particular key (lines 5, 6, and 7).How to detect a key press but only if certain modifier keys are not
being held (8 and 9).Like most other resources, translations 
can be specified in resource files.
While debugging, it is a good idea to specify 
translation tables in files, to minimize recompiling.
LINKEND="EX-1013-04-12"Example 4-12 shows the part of the app-defaults file for xbitmap3 that
sets the translation table.ID="EX-1013-04-12"XBitmap3: specifying translations in the app-defaults file*XmPrimitive.baseTranslations:\
    <Expose>:  RedrawSmallPicture()Note that since resource files are strings, no quotation marks are
needed.  However, for multiple-line translation tables, you still
need to escape the ends of each line with \n\.The resource set here is baseTranslations (new in R5).
(This resource has the same name for all widgets.)
As you know, the contents of the app-default file consist solely of
strings, so Xt processes the setting for baseTranslations
into a translation table using what's called a resource converter.
The resource converter calls XtParseTranslationTable() for you
when you specify translations in a resource file.
Applications intended for both R4 and R5 should also set the
translations resource.  See LINKEND="S2-1013-10-12"Section 10.2.12, "The XtNbaseTranslations Resource" for more
information.In principle, you can modify the translations of existing widgets
to customize their behavior.  However, Motif
discourages this practice since it tends to break user-interface conventions.
In fact, some Motif widgets allow you to modify their translations (no
error is generated), but they do not actually modify their behavior.LINKEND="FN-1013-4-3"ID="FN-1013-4-3"Which translation you cannot modify, and in which widget classes,
is not precisely documented in Motif.  In general, you should avoid
modifying translation of existing widget classes altogether (with
the exception of Primitive).
When modifying the translations of a widget with existing translations,
you may specify a directive to control what happens when there are
conflicts between your new translations and the existing translations.
Xt recognizes one of three directives in a translation table,
beginning with # on the first line, 
which tell how to handle existing translations (either set as 
widget defaults, or in other resource database files):MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-4-60"translations#replace directiveID="IX-1013-4-61"# directivetranslationsID="IX-1013-4-62"translationsreplacingID="IX-1013-4-63"translationsreplacing#replace

Merge the new translations into the existing translation
table, but not to disturb any existing translations.  If a
translation already exists for a particular event, the conflicting

with #augment is ignored.ID="IX-1013-4-67"translations#override directiveID="IX-1013-4-68"overridingtranslationsID="IX-1013-4-69"translationsoverriding#override.
Merge the new translations into the existing translation
table, replacing old values with the current specifications in
the event of conflict.We used #override because this allows us to keep the
translations for <EnterWindow> and <LeaveWindow>
events in place.  In addition, the PushButton widget's
set and unset actions will also remain in
effect for <Btn1Down> and <Btn1Up>.
(For more details on why these
aren't overridden by the new translations, see
Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators.)The translation:ID="SC-1013-4-3"<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:  confirm()specifies that the confirm action should be called in response to a pair

<Btn2Down>,<Btn2Up>:    quit()specify that the PushButton widget's internal set action
should be invoked by pressing
button 2, and that our own quit action should be
invoked by clicking button 2.  Note that we don't bother
to bind the PushButton widget's unset action to
<Btn2Up>,
since the application will disappear as a result of the quit
action.  (The unset action is still used when the user presses
button 2 and then moves the pointer outside the widget before
releasing button 2.  This is one of PushButton's default bindings that
we
have not overridden.)
If we were using the widget for any other purpose, we would
map <Btn2Up> to unset, so that the widget was
restored to its normal appearance when our own action was
completed.ID="S3-1013-4-4"Hardcoding TranslationsID="IX-1013-4-70"hardcodingtranslationsID="IX-1013-4-71"translationshardcodingThere are cases in which an application may want not only to
specify translations in an app-defaults file, but also to
hardcode them into the application.
When you specify translations only in the app-defaults file, the
user has unlimited configurability; if the default
translations are deleted or changed beyond recognition, the
application may no longer work.  But you can hardcode a minimum
set of translations in the code, and then supplement these with
a set of translations in the app-defaults file that you want to
be user-customizable.  Among resources, translations are unique
because the final value can be the result of merging the values
in the resource files with the values in the application
(with other resources you get one or the other, but not a combination).Three Xt functions are used for setting translation tables
from the application code:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-4-72"translationsparsingID="IX-1013-4-73"parsingtranslationsID="IX-1013-4-74"XtParseTranslationTableXtParseTranslationTable()
is used to compile a string translation table into the opaque
internal representation XtTranslations.  (For
translations specified in resource files, this conversion
is performed automatically by a resource converter.)ID="IX-1013-4-75"augmenting translationsID="IX-1013-4-76"translationsaugmentingID="IX-1013-4-77"XtAugmentTranslationsXtAugmentTranslations()
is used, like the #augment directive in a resource file,
to nondestructively merge translations into a widget's existing
translations.ID="IX-1013-4-78"overridingtranslationsID="IX-1013-4-79"translationsoverridingID="IX-1013-4-80"XtOverrideTranslationsXtOverrideTranslations()
is used, like the #override directive in a resource file,
to destructively merge translations into a widget's existing
translations.Both XtAugmentTranslations() and XtOverrideTranslations()
take as arguments a widget and a compiled translation
table returned by XtParseTranslationTable().ID="IX-1013-4-81"translationsreplacingID="IX-1013-4-82"XtSetValues
There is no function that completely replaces a widget's
translations; however, you can do this by calling XtSetValues(),
the general routine for setting resources (whose use is demonstrated
later in this chapter) that set the value of a widget's
XmNtranslations resource to a compiled translation table
returned by XtParseTranslationTable().
ID="IX-1013-4-83"resourcesXmNtranslations (Core)To set the same translations specified in the app-defaults
file from the application itself, we would have used the following
code:
ID="IX-1013-4-84"translationsdefining; in sourceID="EX-1013-04-13"Code fragment: specifying translations in the programstatic char defaultTranslations[] =
       "<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:    confirm() \n\
        <Btn2Down>:             set() \n\
        <Btn2Down>,<Btn2Up>:    quit()";
XtTranslations mytranslations;
    .
    .
    .
mytranslations = XtParseTranslationTable(defaultTranslations);
XtOverrideTranslations(farewell, mytranslations);As mentioned earlier, you will find it more convenient to place the translation
table in the app-defaults file until the last minute, because this allows
changes without recompiling the source.
ID="IX-1013-4-85" SPAN="END"translationsID="S3-1013-4-5"Action ParametersThe params and num-params arguments of an action function
are passed in from the translation table by Xt.
For example, consider an action called Move,
which can move some data left of right.
A translation table that selects events that will invoke Move is
shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-04-14"Example 4-14.ID="EX-1013-04-14"A translation table with action parameters*tetris.translations: \n\
<Key>Left: Move(l) \n\
<Key>Right: Move(r)With this translation table, Move will be passed a params 
argument "l" when the left arrow key is pressed,
and "r" when the right arrow key is pressed.ID="S2-1013-4-7"Adding Actions to Existing WidgetsIt is also possible to add actions to widgets other than Core and
Primitive, but it takes more care.
Usually, when a widget does not provide a certain
callback, it also does not provide various other characteristics that
you want.  For example, to make the Label widget
work like PushButton (pretending that the PushButton widget didn't
already exist), you would have to make
it accept more kinds of input, add the drawing code to highlight the
border and draw the
window darker to simulate shadow, and add the ability to call an
application function.
All of this can be done with actions, but it would take a lot of work.
What can make it difficult is that your code may interact with the
widget's code in unpleasant ways.  When the changes are major, it
makes more sense to create a new widget subclass that shares
some characteristics and code with its superclass.
As we will see, that is
exactly how PushButton is implemented, as a subclass of Label.
The Primitive and DrawingArea widgets, on the other hand,
have no input or output semantics at all, and therefore it is simpler
to add actions to them without conflict.
ID="IX-1013-4-86" SPAN="END"xbitmap applicationxbitmap3 exampleID="S1-1013-4-4"xbitmap4: A Bitmap Editor Without a BitmapEdit WidgetID="IX-1013-4-87" SPAN="START"xbitmap applicationxbitmap4 exampleUntil you have experience working with widget code, it can be
easier to prototype a custom window for your application by
adding to a Primitive widget from the application code.  Once this
code is working, and you have read Chapter 6, Inside a Widget, and Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods, you
can easily move the code into a widget when you want to package it or
take advantage of any of the features of Xt that are inaccessible
from the application.
The code for the BitmapEdit widget was originally written as an
application (as described in this section) and later
moved into a widget (with the result described in Chapters 6 and 7).
Once you understand the structure of a widget,
it becomes easier to write widgets directly than to build the
same functionality in the application first.The xbitmap4 implements an application almost identical to
xbitmap1, but without using the BitmapEdit widget.
The custom bitmap editing window is done in
a Primitive widget, with all the code in the application.
This is an example of a custom window that could not be easily
built using DrawingArea.  This application is a culmination of
everything you have seen so far.  It is also a preview of what you
will see in the next chapter.  The same code in xbitmap4 that
is used to implement the bitmap editor will be moved into widget
code in Chapters 6 and 7.This example takes advantage of application resources to set the
configurable parameters of the bitmap code.  The code that sets up the
application resources is described in LINKEND="S1-1013-3-6"Section 3.6, "Application Resources."  When moving
the code into a widget framework, the same resource list will be used
verbatim.
The example also provides command-line options to set the
important parameters of the bitmap code.  The code for
processing these options is described in LINKEND="S1-1013-3-7"Section 3.7, "Command-line Options."  The code
is the same whether used for setting application resources or
widget resources, except no call equivalent to
XtGetApplicationResources() is necessary in a widget.ID="IX-1013-4-88"eventsExposeThe exposure strategy used for the bitmap editor is the same as for the
small bitmaps in the previous section.  The application creates a
large pixmap of depth one that stores the current image of the
bitmap being edited.  Whenever the screen needs updating, the applicable
part of the pixmap is copied to the Core widget in the
Redraw_picture routine.  Because this pixmap is much bigger than
the ones in the last section, it is an important optimization that only the
required parts of the pixmap are copied.
(This is not the only possible exposure strategy.  This particular
strategy has very low network load, but uses a relatively large amount
of server memory.  For this reason it is not ideal for PC servers.)
ID="IX-1013-4-89"optimizationThe SetUpThings
routine creates the pixmap, draws a grid into it that will persist for
the life of the application, and creates three GCs.  One GC is for
copying from the pixmap to the window, and two are for drawing and
undrawing cells in the pixmap.  The btn_event routine draws and
undraws cells in the pixmap according to pointer clicks and drags, and
calls Redraw_picture to update the Core widget display.Redraw_picture is called both from the application and from Xt.
This is a common trick used to reduce the duplication of drawing code.
Since Redraw_picture is an action, it has an event argument that
is used by Xt to pass in the Expose event describing the area exposed.
This application also uses this argument by constructing a fake event
to pass in information about which part of the widget to draw.
ID="IX-1013-4-90"argumentsto actionsID="IX-1013-4-91"eventsin action routinesThe application adds actions and sets the XmNtranslations
resource of the Core widget so that Xt calls the application routine
Redraw_picture whenever Expose events arrive, and
calls
btn_event when ButtonPress or MotionNotify
events arrive.LINKEND="EX-1013-04-15"Example 4-15 shows the complete code for xbitmap4.  You have seen
all the techniques here in various examples before.  You should work through
the code and make sure you understand the purpose of each section.
However, don't worry about the details of the Xlib calls, since they
are specific to this application.ID="EX-1013-04-15"xbitmap4: implementing the bitmap editor from the application/*

yet been introduced, and describes the features that Motif
adds to the model provided by the Xt Intrinsics.This book is primarily about how to program with the Xt Intrinsics,
and has used the Motif widgets to demonstrate those techniques.
It has so far not described many of the Motif widgets, and hasn't
touched the surface of the topic of how to combine them
to best advantage.  Complete coverage of these topics is left to
Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual.
However, this chapter will acquaint you with the default appearance
and general purpose of the Motif widgets we have not yet used.
With this information, you should gain a general idea of
the range of widgets you have to choose from.Motif also provides many features that are roughly at the same
level as those provided by Xt, but that go beyond those provided by Xt.
Part of Motif, therefore, is a kind of extension of Xt.
This chapter will provide sufficient introduction so that you
know the purpose and capabilities of each of these features.
This will enable you to determine whether these features will be
useful in your application, and warrant further investigation.
Again, more complete coverage of these features, with
examples, will be left to Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual.Note that Motif includes several components:MARK="BULLET"A widget set that works with the Xt Intrinsics libraryA set of functions that provide additional Xt-level features.The Motif Window Manager (mwm)The User Interface Language (UIL) and Motif Resource Manager (MRM), which
is a set of functions
that works with Xt as well as a compiler that takes an ASCII file
as input and generates a program-readable user interface description as
outputA style guide which governs how a user interface should be put
together in order to be certified as OSF/Motif compliantWe do not discuss the Motif Window Manager or style guide in any
detail in this book.  See Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual for more information.ID="S1-1013-5-1"The Remaining Motif Widgets and GadgetsLet's begin with the primitive widgets that you haven't yet seen in
examples in this book.  These are widgets that do not manage child
widgets.  Although we have not explicitly created
ArrowButton and ScrollBar widgets, you have seen them as part of
MainWindow and ScrolledWindow.  ArrowButton is the widget used at the
ends of ScrollBars.  ScrollBars, in turn, are created automatically by
MainWindow and ScrolledWindow.Command widgets are for keeping track of typed commands.  The upper
window shows the history of past commands typed, and the lower window
shows the command currently being typed.
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-1"Figure 5-1 shows a Command widget.ID="FG-1013-05-1"A Command widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-1"ID="IX-1013-5-1"FileSelectionDialog widgetThe FileSelectionBox is a complex widget which allows the user to
move through the file system to select a file.
See Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide, Motif Edition, for a description of how the user manipulates this widget.
A FileSelectionBox can be created by itself without the buttons at
the bottom (with XmCreateFileSelectionBox()) or it can be
created as part of a dialog with XmCreateFileSelectionDialog().
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-2"Figure 5-2 shows a FileSelectionDialog widget.ID="FG-1013-05-2"A FileSelectionDialog widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-2"A SelectionBox allows the user to choose from a list of alternatives.
It provides a scrolled list, and a text area.  The user can select
from the list using the pointer, or type the name from the list.
A SelectionBox can also be created as part of a dialog with
XmCreateSelectionDialog(). 
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-3"Figure 5-3 shows a SelectionDialog widget.ID="FG-1013-05-3"A SelectionDialog widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-3"ID="IX-1013-5-2"selectionsSelectionBox widgetText is a text editor in a single widget.  It can edit single line or
multiline text.  By default it uses Emacs-style editing commands.
TextField is a single line text editor with provision for verification
that the user supplied acceptable data.
The Text and TextField widgets provide a multitude of functions for
accessing and manipulating their contents from the application.
The XmCreateScrolledText() function is used for creating a
Text widget with ScrollBars.
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-4"Figure 5-4 shows a TextField widget.  A Text widget is similar but includes
multiline editing capabilities.ID="FG-1013-05-4"A TextField widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-4"ID="IX-1013-5-3"Text widgetID="IX-1013-5-4"TextField widgetThe Separator widget is used to visually separate distinct areas
within larger components.  It just draws a line between widgets.
Separators can be used to separate items in
popup menus, action areas within dialog boxes, or simply adjacent
geometry managing widgets.
Usually you should use a SeparatorGadget instead.
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-5"Figure 5-5 shows a menu containing elements separated with Separator widgets.ID="FG-1013-05-5"A menu containing buttons separated by Separator widgetsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.05.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-5"ID="IX-1013-5-5"Separator widgetA ToggleButton sets a boolean value.
ToggleButton is designed to be added in groups to
a RadioBox or a CheckBox.  See
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-6"Figure 5-6.
Both RadioBox and CheckBox are implemented
using a RowColumn widget.
The resources that distinguish these two types of user interface
elements are automatically set when you use the XmCreateRadioBox()
or XmCreateSimpleCheckBox() convenience functions.
ID="IX-1013-5-6"ToggleButton widgetID="IX-1013-5-7"RadioBox widgetID="IX-1013-5-8"CheckBox widget
Each ToggleButton in a RadioBox has a
diamond-shaped indicator, and only one ToggleButton at a time can
be chosen.  In a CheckBox, each ToggleButton has
a square indicator and any number of the ToggleButtons can be
selected at the same time.ID="FG-1013-05-6"ToggleButton widgets used in a RadioBox and a CheckBoxFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.06.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-6"A DrawnButton is a widget that works like a PushButton but it is
empty except for a button shadow.  It provides callbacks for exposure
and resize events, so that you can provide your own drawing code.
DrawnButtons are not often used, since PushButtons allow you to supply
either text or a pixmap as its label.  A DrawnButton can be used to
implement an animated button (where the contents change frequently),
or to draw text that is beyond the capabilities of a PushButton.
Since a DrawnButton has no distinctive appearance, one is not shown.
ID="IX-1013-5-9"DrawnButton widgetThe Scale is really a slider widget, which can be used for input or output.
A Scale is shown in

both single and multiple selection styles.
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-8"Figure 5-8 shows a list widget containing
numerous choices.  XmCreateScrolledList() creates a
specialized form of List that is for managing large lists.
ID="IX-1013-5-11"List widgetSix types of simple widgets are also available as gadgets
(window-less widgets): PushButtonGadget, LabelGadget,
ArrowButtonGadget, CascadeButtonGadget, SeparatorGadget, and
ToggleButtonGadget.  However, as of R5, you should avoid using
gadgets since they can result in increased network load.ID="FG-1013-05-8"A List widget containing selectable stringsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.08.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-8"ID="S2-1013-5-1"Geometry Managing WidgetsAll Motif geometry managing widgets are subclasses of the Manager
class.  Instances of Manager itself are never created.
Manager serves the same purpose for geometry managing widgets as
Primitive does for graphics widgets.  It provides the features
common to all Motif widgets, such as 3-D shadows, keyboard traversal,
and so on.Motif uses RowColumn very heavily.  All of the following are
not separate widget classes; they are RowColumn widgets
with certain resource settings:
ID="IX-1013-5-12"RowColumn widgetMARK="BULLET"WorkArea--the default RowColumn type.CheckBox--a box designed to contain ToggleButtons, in which
several can be selected at the same time.RadioBox--a box designed to contain ToggleButtons, in which
only one can be selected.OptionMenu--appears as a button and an associated
menu.  The button shows the current selection from the menu.
The menu appears over the button.PulldownMenu--a menu that appears just below a button that
pops it up.PopupMenu--a menu that pops up at the pointer position.MenuBar--a horizontal bar across the top of the application's
main window, containing CascadeButtons that post menus.RowColumns do not have a three dimensional appearance, so they may be
placed next to one another without giving the user the impression that
their sub-elements are grouped independently.
However, they can be placed within Frame to generate a 3-D appearance.ID="IX-1013-5-13"BulletinBoard widgetBulletinBoard is a geometry managing widget that has very simple
rules.  It is used by Motif in most dialog widgets.
After resizing, it leaves child widgets where they were originally
placed, or it moves them somewhat to avoid overlapping.
Motif supplies XmCreateBulletinBoard() for general use and
XmCreateBulletinBoardDialog() for building your own dialogs.
Some applications use BulletinBoard as their work area, so that they
have a static layout which does not change upon resizing.
If a BulletinBoard is resized
smaller than the current layout of the widgets it contains, the
widgets are clipped and may not be completely visible.The ScrolledWindow widget is used to implement a "window" into a
data object (such as text or graphics).  If the data being viewed
is larger than the ScrolledWindow, scrollbars are
attached to enable the user to view portions of the window
interactively.  ScrolledWindow is capable of automatically creating
and operating its own ScrollBar widget children.
You have to provide ScrolledWindow with a work area to manage.
ID="IX-1013-5-14"scrollbarsScrolledWindow widgetID="IX-1013-5-15"MainWindow widgetThe MainWindow widget acts as the standard layout manager for the
main application's window.  It is designed specifically
to contain a MenuBar, an optional command window,
a work region, and scrollbars.  This widget is an extension
of the ScrolledWindow widget.
You have to provide MainWindow with a work area and menu bar to manage.ID="IX-1013-5-16"Frame widgetThe Frame widget manages one child within a visible border that the
Frame draws.  It is most often used to provide a 3-D
border for RowColumn and Form widgets, which otherwise have no
3-D look.ID="IX-1013-5-17"PanedWindow widgetThe PanedWindow widget manages its children in a vertically tiled
format only.  Its width fluctuates with the widest widget in its
list of managed children.  The widget provides a sash
to allow the user to adjust the height of each pane.ID="IX-1013-5-18"Form widgetThe Form widget has an elaborate means of
linking the edges of its children to itself and to one another.
Different layout criteria can be specified for each child.
Form widgets are good managers to use as children of DialogShells
that you build yourself.  Like RowColumn widgets, Forms have no border,
allowing them to be placed next to other geometry managing widgets
without giving the appearance that their items are grouped
separately.  A Frame widget is used to give Forms visible boundaries.ID="S2-1013-5-2"Dialog WidgetsID="IX-1013-5-19" SPAN="START"Dialog widgetsdifferent kinds ofDialogShell and MenuShell perform the window manager interaction
as parent widgets of dialog widgets and menus respectively.
DialogShell is created alone only when you are creating a custom
dialog box that is not based on BulletinBoard or Form (since
XmCreateBulletinBoardDialog() and XmCreateFormDialog()
exist).  MenuShell is used when you are creating a menu that is
not one of the standard types created by XmCreatePulldownMenu(),
XmCreatePopupMenu(), XmCreateOptionMenu(), etc.A simple Help dialog box was demonstrated in LINKEND="S2-1013-3-6"Section 3.4.2, "Creating a Basic Dialog Box." This was a MessageBox created as a dialog using
XmCreateMessageDialog().
A MessageBox widget can be configured to display a symbol that
represents the kind of information being displayed.  Motif
defines five symbols for this purpose, and provides a widget
creation function that creates a MessageBox as a dialog for
each symbol.  They are 
XmCreateErrorDialog(),
XmCreateInformationDialog(),
XmCreateQuestionDialog(),
XmCreateWorkingDialog(), and
XmCreateWarningDialog().
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-9"Figure 5-9 shows these five types of dialogs.ID="FG-1013-05-9"Dialog boxes with the five standard symbolsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.09.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-9"As noted in Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets, there is no standard dialog for help information.
However, the InformationDialog seems most appropriate, once its
Cancel button and possibly its Help button are unmanaged.
ID="IX-1013-5-20" SPAN="END"Dialog widgetsdifferent kinds ofID="S1-1013-5-2"Widget Creation FunctionsID="IX-1013-5-21" SPAN="START"functionswidget creationID="IX-1013-5-22" SPAN="START"widgetsroutines for creatingYou have already seen a few of the functions Motif provides for
creating widgets.  For example, in Chapter 3 we used
XmCreatePulldownMenu(), XmCreateMenuBar(), and
XmCreateMessageDialog() in xmainwindow.  As you may
recall, these are very similar to Xt's widget creation functions
except that in the Motif routines:MARK="BULLET"The widget parent argument comes before the widget instance name
argument (the reverse of the Xt functions).No widget class pointer is necessary (it is implied by the function name).A separate XtManageChild() call is required to display the widget.There are many more of these functions.  Some of them create single
widgets, some create single widgets with certain special resource
settings, and some create combinations of widgets.For users of other widget sets such as Athena, the use of
the IDs returned by Motif widget creation
functions can be a bit confusing.
The functions that create combinations of widgets don't always
return the top level widget of the combination.  For example,
XmCreateMessageDialog() returns the ID of the
MessageBox widget, not the ID of the DialogShell that
XmCreateMessageDialog() creates as its
parent.
This allows you to easily set the resources of the MessageBox.
When you want to pop up the dialog, you call XtManageChild()
with the ID of the MessageBox, not its DialogShell parent.
(Users of the Athena widget set popup widgets
by calling XtPopup() on the Shell widget.)Here is a complete list of the XmCreate* functions, and a

stringsID="IX-1013-5-26" SPAN="START"fontsrepresented by compound stringsID="IX-1013-5-27" SPAN="START"fontsforeign languageCompound strings are designed to address two issues frequently
encountered by application designers:  the use of foreign character
sets to display text in other languages, and the use of multiple
fonts when rendering text.Many character sets used by foreign languages
are too large for the characters to be represented by the
char type,
as English can be.  Compound strings solve this problem by representing
characters as 16 bit values ("words") rather than the classic
8 bit values ("chars").  Also, since some languages such as Hebrew and
Arabic are read from right-to-left, compound strings also store
directional information for rendering purposes.
Compound strings allow widgets to handle different languages
transparently to the application.  All the application has to do
is not hard code any strings in the application.  All strings should
be external to the application, usually in resource files or
ID="IX-1013-5-28"XPG3ID="IX-1013-5-29"X/Open
XPG3 (X/Open) message catalogues, or if using UIL, in UID files.
In this section, we demonstrate the simplest usages of compound
strings, in a way not intended to be internationalized since
the strings are hard coded.A compound string is made of three elements: a font list element tag,
a direction and text.
Compound strings that incorporate multiple fonts are achieved by
concatenating
separate compound strings with different character sets together to
produce a single string.  A separator is placed between each compound
string.ID="S2-1013-5-3"Simple Compound StringsAlmost all of the Motif widgets require a compound string when
specifying text.
Labels, PushButtons, Lists--all require their text to be
given in compound string format, whether or not you require the
additional flexibility compound strings provide.LINKEND="FN-1013-5-1"ID="FN-1013-5-1"As of Motif 1.2 the Text widget does not use compound strings.
Therefore, the most common use for compound strings in
English-language applications is simply to convert standard
C-style null-terminated text strings for use in a widget.First of all, strings specified in resource files need not be
converted, since Motif will automatically do the conversion.ID="IX-1013-5-30"XmStringCreateLocalized functionTo do the conversion for strings specified directly in the application code,
we use the function XmStringCreateLocalized().ID="SC-1013-5-1"XmString
XmStringCreateLocalized(text)
    char *text;The text parameter is a common C char string.
The value returned is of type XmString which is an opaque type
to the programmer.As its name implies, XmStringCreateLocalized()
converts a C string into a compound string using the current
locale.  You cannot specify a font, a string direction, or
have multiple lines.  As mentioned earlier, no strings should
be specified in an internationalized application,
although we do so here for simplicity.ID="SC-1013-5-2"XmString str = XmStringCreateLocalized("Push Me");
widget = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("widget_name",
    xmPushButtonGadgetClass, parent,
    XmNlabelString,  str,
    NULL);
XmStringFree(str);ID="IX-1013-5-31"XmStringFree functionXmStringCreateLocalized(), along with the other functions that
create compound strings, allocates memory to store the strings created.
Widgets whose resources take compound strings as values always allocate
their own
space and store copies of the compound string values you give them, so you
must free your copy of the string after having set it in the
widget resource.  Compound strings are freed using XmStringFree().This three-step process is typical of the type of interaction you
will have with compound strings.  You create a string, set it in a widget,
then free the string (unless you want to use it in another widget).
However, this process involves quite a bit of overhead; memory is allocated
by the string creation function, then again by the internals of the widget
for its own storage, and then your copy of the string must be deallocated
(freeing memory is also an expensive operation).ID="IX-1013-5-32"XtVaTypedArgused with compound stringsThis process can be simplified by using the XtVaTypedArg feature
in Xt.  This symbol is used in variable argument list specifications
for functions like XtVaCreateManagedWidget() or XtVaSetValues().
It allows you to specify resources in any type--most likely
a more convenient one--and have Xt do the conversion for you.  In the
case of compound strings, this method can be used convert between
C strings and compound strings without having to do it yourself.
The following code fragment has the same effect as the example shown above
without the overhead of the three-step process.ID="SC-1013-5-3"widget = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("widget_name",
    xmPushButtonWidgetClass, parent,
    XtVaTypedArg,
      XmNlabelString, XmRString, "Push Me", strlen("Push Me") + 1,
    NULL);XtVaTypedArg takes four additional parameters: the resource
whose value is going to be set, the type of the value we are giving
the resource, the value itself, and the size of the value's data
type.  (Note that this fourth parameter is the size of the value
itself, not the size of the type!)The resource is XmNlabelString, and its value is of
type XmString (a compound string).
We specify XmRString as the type of the value we
are going to provide.LINKEND="FN-1013-5-2"ID="FN-1013-5-2"This terminology can get confusing.  Xt uses the
typedef String for char *.  The representation
type used by Xt resource converters for this datatype is XtRString
(XmRString in Motif).  A compound string, on the other
hand, is of type XmString, with the representation type used with
resource converters specified as XmRXmString.
You just have to read the symbols carefully.  And it
helps if you have a good understanding of the underlying
mechanism of resource converters, which are described in detail
in Chapter 9, More Input Techniques.
The string "Push Me" is that value, and it's length,
including terminating NULL, is calculated with strlen.ID="S2-1013-5-4"Strings with Multiple FontsA common use of compound strings is
to display a string using multiple fonts.To incorporate more than one font in a single compound string,
you must create a fontList that specifies multiple
fonts or font sets.  Then you must either create the compound text
in segments using the function XmStringSegmentCreate()
(a routine that allows you to control both the font list element tag and
the direction of a compound string), or you must create separate
compound strings using XmStringCreate() and then
concatenate them with XmStringConcat().
This concatenated string will have information
embedded in it to indicate font changes.

}Again, it's important to note that an internationalized application
could not contain hardcoded strings as shown here.  Instead, all
strings would be external to the application (in resource files
or message catalogues).The output of this code fragment is shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-05-10"Figure 5-10.ID="FG-1013-05-10"xcomstring.c: how it looks on the screenFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="05.10.gif" ID="GC-1013-5-11"ID="IX-1013-5-35"XmNfontList resourceThe XmNfontList resource is specified to contain two fonts
as shown in LINKEND="EX-1013-05-2"Example 5-2.
Each string is created using XmStringCreate()
with the appropriate text and font list element tag specified.  Then,
the strings are concatenated together using XmStringConcat(),
two at a time, until we have a single compound string that contains
all the text and includes all the font changes.It is possible to specify compound text strings (such as the
XmNlabelString resource of the PushButton widget) in resource
files as normal strings.  This is possible because Motif takes care
of the conversion to compound strings.  However, when you want font
changes within a string, you need to create compound strings or
segments explicitly within the application as illustrated in

strcpy(), strcmp(), and strcat(), to copy,
compare and modify strings.  However, these functions are ineffective
with compound strings since compound strings are not based on
a byte-per-character
format and they have other types of information embedded within them
(character sets, directions and separators).  In order to accomplish
some of these common tasks, you can either convert the compound string
back into C strings or use the functions Motif provides to manipulate
compound strings directly.  Your choice depends
largely on the complexity of the compound strings you have and the
complexity of the manipulations you need to do.We've already seen how XmStringConcat() is used to concatenate
compound strings.  The following utility functions are also

    XmString str;The XmStringNConcat() and XmStringNCopy() functions
differ from their
"N-less" brethren in that they concatenate or copy, respectively,
only n characters from the specified string.
Otherwise, the purpose of these functions is readily apparent
from their names.  Note however that since a compound string
includes various tags, direction indicators and segment
separators, XmStringLength() cannot be used
to get the length of the text represented by the compound string
(i.e., it's not the same as strlen()).ID="S2-1013-5-6"Converting Compound Strings to TextID="IX-1013-5-44"compound stringsconverting to textIf the functions provided by the Motif routines in the previous section
are inadequate, you can convert compound strings back into C strings.
This process can be simple or complicated depending on the complexity
of the compound string to be converted.  If the compound string
has one font list element tag
associated with it and it has a left-to-right orientation, the process
is quite simple.  Fortunately, this is likely to be the case most
of the time.ID="IX-1013-5-45"XmStringGetLtoR functionTo make the conversion, you can use the function:ID="SC-1013-5-5"Boolean
XmStringGetLtoR(string, tag, text)
    XmString            string;
    char               *tag;
    char              **text;The function takes a compound string and a font list element tag and converts
it back into a C character string.  If successful, the function returns
True and the text parameter will point to a newly allocated
pointer to a string.The function only gets the text from the compound string 
that is associated with the font list element tag 
specified in tag.  If the string contains
multiple fonts, only the text associated with those segments with
the same font is copied into the returned text.As its name implies, this function gets only left-to-right oriented text.
In order to convert compound strings that have either a right-to-left
orientation or multiple fonts, you will have to
scan through the elements of a compound string
segment by segment (a process described in Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual).ID="S2-1013-5-7"Rendering Compound StringsID="IX-1013-5-46"compound stringsrenderingMotif always renders compound strings automatically within its widgets.
More precisely, the widgets themselves manage compound string rendering.
However, Motif provides convenient functions for doing the rendering
which you may find useful if you are
writing your own Motif-compatible widgets or extensions to Motif widgets.For more information on this topic, see Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual.

by the server.  It is accessed from the application using an ID.
A pixmap can be created using a pattern defined in file, or drawn into,
and copied to a window.Motif's pixmap caching has a simple use and a more complicated use.
The simple use is described in this paragraph.
Motif provides XmGetPixmap(), which reads a bitmap file from disk
and creates a pixmap of the default depth of the screen.
XmGetPixmap() caches the pixmap so that subsequent requests
for the same filename will return the original pixmap.
The only thing slightly confusing about XmGetPixmap()
is that you specify your filename (including path) in the
image-name argument.X also defines a client-side representation of a window area, called
an image.  An image is usually generated by grabbing a portion
of an existing window or pixmap using XGetImage().
ID="IX-1013-5-51"XGetImage Xlib function
An image is a structure that contains all the
data from a window area, using the server's natural data format.
The structure also includes fields that describe the combination of
byte-order, bit-order, and image format used by the server.  Unlike
many other Xlib structures, the image structure is public--its fields
are documented--since it is stored on the client side.  Because
of the many permutations of server formats that are possible, Xlib
provides generalized functions for manipulating image data, though they
are rather slow because they always convert the data into the
client's natural format before processing it.
An image can be dumped into a window or pixmap using XPutImage().
ID="IX-1013-5-52"XPutImage Xlib functionMotif uses images to allow pixmaps to be specified in resource files,
and to allow multiple instances of a widget to share one pixmap
stored in the server.  For example, you know that the MessageBox
widget has several variations, with different symbols for
information, warning, error, question, and working.  Each of these
symbols is created by MessageBox using
ID="IX-1013-5-53"XmInstallImage functionXmInstallImage().  (This happens before any instances of the
widget class are created, in the class_initialize
method, which will be described later.)
To install each image, first an image structure is created and filled
with data in standard X11 bitmap file format.  Then this structure
is passed to XmInstallImage().  Also passed is the string name
for this image, which will be used to used to refer
to the image in resource files.  For example, the question symbol
is called default_xm_question.When an instance of MessageBox is created using a call such as
XmCreateQuestionDialog(), the XmNdialogType resource
is automatically set to XmDIALOG_QUESTION.  In a switch
statement, MessageBox maps this symbol into the corresponding image
name, "default_xm_question."  MessageBox calls XmGetPixmap() to
get the pixmap specified by this image name.  If the pixmap already
exists because another QuestionDialog has already been created, then
this pixmap is set into the XmNsymbolPixmap resource.
If the pixmap does not yet exist, it is created, cached for later use
by widgets of this type, and set into XmNsymbolPixmap.
(You can also bypass this entire facility from the application by
creating your own pixmap and setting XmNsymbolPixmap directly.)Motif keeps reference counts in order to free these cached pixmaps
when they are no longer needed.  Therefore, MessageBox calls
ID="IX-1013-5-54"XmDestroyPixmap functionXmDestroyPixmap() when the XmNsymbolPixmap is set
directly, when the dialog type is changed, or when the widget itself
is destroyed.  XmDestroyPixmap()
just decrements the reference count to a pixmap--the pixmap is
destroyed only if no other widgets are using it.Motif defines a group of images that are pre-installed in the image
cache.  Each of these is converted into pixmaps when they are
first used to set a widget resource,
using the current foreground and background colors for that first
widget.

LBL="5-2"Table 5-2   Built-in Motif PixmapsAny of these pre-installed images or the images installed by
Motif widgets such as MessageBox can be specified in
resource files.  For example, the following resource setting
could appear in an app-defaults file:ID="SC-1013-5-6"*XmCascadeButton.backgroundPixmap: 25_foregroundThis resource setting makes the background of CascadeButtons
slightly darker than they usually are, which makes their outline
visible over the menubar.
ID="IX-1013-5-56" SPAN="END"image cachingID="S1-1013-5-5"Dynamic Resource DefaultingID="IX-1013-5-57"resourcessetting; defaultsMost resources have a fixed default value determined by the widget
class.  However, several of the basic appearance resources supported
by Primitive have defaults that are set at run time.  Namely, the
foreground, background, and the two shadow colors used by a widget
are set dynamically depending on the type of screen being used and
on the settings of each other.  The highlight color, used to redraw
the background when the user clicks on a PushButton, is also
dynamically defaulted.By default on a color screen,
Motif chooses a light blue background, a black foreground,
a very light blue-gray top shadow, a dark blue-gray bottom shadow,
and a medium blue highlight color.
These are carefully chosen to strengthen the 3-D effect of the
interface.  If the user sets the background color to sea green,
Motif adjusts the foreground, background, shadow colors, and
highlight color so that they work well with a green background.  If
the user chooses a dark color for the background, white instead of
black is used for the text.  However, the user should be informed
that light colors work best for the background, since the highlight
color must be darker than the background color to make buttons look
pressed in.On a gray-scale screen, Motif selects a black foreground, white
background, and uses light gray and dark gray for the shadows.
Medium gray is used for the highlight color.
On a black and white screen, the same colors are used, but light
gray and dark gray are simulated using pixmaps containing different
percentages of white and black.Dynamic resource defaults are implemented using a standard feature
of the R4 Xt Intrinsics called XmRCallProc (called
XtRCallProc in standard Xt).  In the resource
list, which has not yet been introduced, you can either specify a
default value or a function to be called to calculate the default value.
Motif does the latter for these resources.ID="S1-1013-5-6"Resolution IndependenceID="IX-1013-5-58"units of measurementsettingAs you know, the units for all Xlib and Xt calls are pixels.
Motif allows you to set some resources using units such as inches,
so that the size and spacing of widgets will appear the same size on
any display, regardless of the pixel spacing on that display.This resolution-independence is built into
all position, dimension, spacing, padding, offset, and thickness
resources of all Motif widgets.
The interpretation of dimensions within each widget is controlled by
the XmNunitType resource, which can be
set anywhere where resources can be set, including in resource files.For some applications,
such as desktop publishing, resolution independence is important.  For
others, it is irrelevant, or in fact harmful, because while size of
graphics will be the same on all screens, the quality of those
graphics will vary.  What is clear on a 1280 by 1024 screen may not
be clear on a 640 by 480 screen if the graphics are the same size.XmNunitType can be set to the following values:MARK="BULLET"XmPIXELS--all values provided to the widget are
treated as normal pixel values.Xm100TH_MILLIMETERS--all values provided to the
widget are treated as 1/100 millimeter.Xm1000TH_INCHES--all values provided to the widget
are treated as 1/1000 inch.Xm100TH_POINTS--all values provided to the widget
are treated as 1/100 point.  A point is a unit used
in text processing applications and is defined as
1/72 inch.Xm100TH_FONT_UNITS--all values provided to the
widget are treated as 1/100 of a font unit.The font unit allows you to specify sizes based on a font that
will be chosen at run time according to your specifications.
The font used is the one the user specifies with the -font
command-line option or by setting the XmNfont resource
(not XmNfontList) in a resource file.  (XmNfont is
used only for this in Motif.)  The font unit is calculated from the
dimensions of the specified font.
A font unit can also be set with XmSetFontUnits().
Note that once XmNunitType is set to Xm100TH_FONT_UNITS,
and the font set, the actual numbers used to set resources
are integral and generally large.Unless XmNunitType is explicitly set, all widgets that are
subclasses of Manager inherit the unit type of their parent.
All widgets that are subclasses of Primitive have a default unit
type of XmPIXELS. (They do not inherit their parent's unit type.)Once a unit type is set, you can set resources using this
unit type, and when you query them with XtVaGetValues(), you will
get values that use this unit type.  A one-time rounding error may
occur, though, which could make the value you query slightly
different from the value you set.  Repeated queries and sets
will not make the rounding error worse.
(Internally, widgets still store all their values in pixels.
This becomes important to you only when you begin to write widgets.)Motif also provides XmConvertUnits() for converting between
units.  If you need to write your own widget that implements resolution
independent custom graphics, you can use XmConvertUnits(), or
you can use Xlib macros that give you the number of pixels and the
size of the screen.ID="S1-1013-5-7"Keyboard Traversal and FocusID="IX-1013-5-59" SPAN="START"keyboardkeyboard focus; in Motif widgetsAll Motif widgets are able to operate with keyboard input instead
of pointer input.  This is primarily so that people can use the
keyboard to navigate forms conveniently, but it
is also so that Motif applications can be run on systems that don't
have a mouse.Xt directs keyboard input to only one window at a time;
this window has the keyboard focus.
All Motif widgets and gadgets have code that gives them the ability to draw
a highlight rectangle around themselves when they have the keyboard
focus.  (In practice, geometry managing widgets do not draw a highlight
rectangle because they do not take user input.)
The parent tells a gadget when to highlight,
since gadgets can never get the focus themselves since they have no window.The traversal works in two levels.  The first level is movement
between tab groups, and the second level is movement within a tab
group.  A tab group is one or more widgets.
As you build the instance hierarchy of an application,
Motif automatically links the widgets together into groups.
By default, most simple widgets are a tab group by themselves.
Most manager widgets are also tab groups, with all their children
in the same tab group.  For example, a MessageBox widget
is really a Form widget containing a Label widget and three
PushButton widgets; the Form, the Label, and
the three pushbutton widgets are a tab group.  However, since
the Form and Label widgets set XmNtraversalOn to False since
they don't take user input, they are not active in the tab group.You can move the keyboard
focus around in a tab group by using the arrow keys (also called
navigation keys, since other keys may be mapped to this function).Pressing the Tab key moves the focus to the first widget in the
next tab group.  Pressing Tab while holding the Shift key moves the
focus to the first widget in the previous tab group.Without doing anything, you should be able to negotiate your entire
application using the keyboard, since Motif sets up default tab groups.
However, you may want to tailor the order in which widgets are traversed
within each tab group, and also the order in which tab groups are traversed.The order of traversal of the widgets within a tab group is the
same as the order in which the widgets were created.  If a widget is normally
included in a tab group, but you don't want it to be, set its
XmNtraversalOn resources to False.In Motif 1.1 you could modify the order of traversal between tab
groups using XmAddTabGroup() and XmRemoveTabGroup().
Both functions just set the specified widget's
XmNnavigationType resource.
These functions are obsolete in Motif 1.2: now you just set
the XmNnavigationType resource yourself to
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP to 
add a widget to a tab group, or XmNONE to remove one.
There are various other settings
for this resource that you can use if you set the resource directly
instead of using these functions.You can also move the focus by clicking the pointer in a widget that
can accept the focus (has XmNtraversalOn set to
True).  Within Motif applications, you can choose
between a click-to-type model, which supports keyboard traversal,
and a pointer-following model, which does not support keyboard
traversal.  The default is the click-to-type model.  You can change
this by setting the XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy resource of a
Shell widget, but this is not recommended.
Note that this resource sets the keyboard focus model within this
one application; this is completely separate from the model you choose
for mwm, although the two choices available in each case are
the same.List, ScrollBar, multiline Text widgets, and Option menus must be
sole members of a tab group, because they use the arrow keys for
other purposes.Because keyboard traversal depends on Motif moving the keyboard focus
around, applications should not set the keyboard focus explicitly.
In other words, you should never call XtSetKeyboardFocus()
or XSetInputFocus().
Instead you can call XmProcessTraversal().Even Motif menus can be operated using the keyboard.  A menu can
be mapped by a mnemonic such as Alt-F typed anywhere in the application.
Once mapped, the menu can be traversed
with the arrow keys, and an item selected with the Return key.
Alternately, if the strings in the menu have mnemonics defined,
they will have letters underlined, and the user can type these
letters to select the item.  Finally, menu items can be selected
without the menu being mapped by using accelerator keys, which are described
in Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators.
ID="IX-1013-5-60" SPAN="END"keyboardkeyboard focus; in Motif widgetsID="S1-1013-5-8"Motif Virtual Keyboard BindingsThe main alphabetic area of keyboards on different systems is very
uniform, but the modifier keys such as Control, Alt,
Meta, Hyper, and Super, and the function keys, are not uniform.
The X keyboard model hides many of the differences between the
different keyboards that are available on different systems.
Each X server contains a mapping between the keycodes for each
physical key, and keysyms, which are symbolic constants each of which
represents a standardized meaning of a key combination.
For example, there are separate keysyms XK_A and XK_a
which represent the "a" key with and without the Shift key pressed.
See Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, for an extensive discussion of this model.Motif adds another level of mapping to this system.
Translation tables for Motif widgets reference keysyms
not defined by the Xlib standard.  For example, a line in the
translation table of every Motif widget reads as follows:ID="SC-1013-5-7"static char defaultTranslation[] =
     .
     .
   <Key>osfHelp:    Help()";The string osfHelp is in the position normally occupied by
a keysym, but in this case it is a Motif virtual keysym.  Motif
then internally maps this string into a real keysym.Motif maps virtual keysyms into real keysyms using the file
XKeysymDB, which is usually in /usr/lib/X11 on UNIX-based
systems.  The contents of this file are different for each system,
and installing this file is part of installing Motif.
For example, on systems that have a Help key, osfHelp will be
mapped to that key.  On systems that don't have a Help key, some
other key is chosen.  The advantage of the Motif virtual binding system
is that you can be assured that there actually is a key that performs
the Help function, even if it isn't marked, and that all Motif
applications on that system will use the same key.  Also, on single
user systems this gives the user the option of changing which key
is used for each function.Motif 1.2 provides a new function, XmTranslateKey(), to
translate a keycode into a virtual key.  This function allows applications
that override the default XtKeyProc to handle Motif
virtual keys.  Motif 1.2 also includes a new client, xmbind,
that configures the virtual key bindings for Motif applications.
This action is performed by the Motif Window Manager (mwm) at
startup, so you only need to use xmbind if you are not using mwm or
if you want to reconfigure the bindings without restarting mwm.ID="S1-1013-5-9"Drag and DropMotif 1.2 introduces a new user interface for transferring data within
an application or between applications,
called drag and drop.  From the user's perspective,
data can be moved or copied by dragging an iconic representation of the
data.LINKEND="FN-1013-5-3"ID="FN-1013-5-3"Dragging is the act of pressing a mouse button with the pointer
over the object, moving the mouse with the button held down, and
releasing the object in a new location by releasing the mouse button.Mouse button 2 is reserved for drag-and-drop.  When the user
begins a drag with button two over a "drag source", the
pointer is replaced with a special drag icon.  This icon
indicates the type of data being dragged (text, pixmap,
etc.), the drag operation (copy, move, or "link"), and
whether the pointer is over a valid "drop site", an invalid
drop site or no drop site.  The drag icon may change as it
enters and leaves drop sites, and drop sites themselves may
change their visuals when the
drop icon is within them.  These changing graphics in drag
icon and drop site are referred to as "drag over" and "drag
under" visuals, respectively.The type of data being dragged and the default operation
(copy, move, or link) depends on the drag source.  If the
drag source supports multiple operations, the user can
select an operation other than the default with the Shift
and Ctrl modifiers.The user can cancel a drag by pressing the Escape key.  The
user can request help on a drop site before dropping by pressing
the F1 key.Text, List, Label and Button widgets support drag and drop as
drag sources, which means that text can be dragged from them.  Text
and TextField widget support drag and drop as drop sites, which means
that text can be dragged to them.
The Label class also supports dragging of Pixmap data.
If you use existing widgets, therefore, there is no extra programming
necessary to provide drag and drop.
Custom drag and drop support can be added to any widget.  Custom drag
icons and drop site visuals can also be implemented.
The details of implementing drag and drop in an application are
beyond the scope of this book.  See the OSF/Motif Programming
Manual for more information.ID="S2-1013-5-8"Drag ProtocolIn order to implement drag-over effects, the originator of
the drag must know when it has entered a valid drop site.
In order to implement customized drag-under effects, the
process controlling the drop site must know when there is a
drag icon inside of it.  It is not possible to gracefully
satisfy all of these requirements with X.  To work around
this, Motif drag-and-drop supports two different drag
protocols with different tradeoffs.  The protocol used
depends on the preference of the user and on
which protocols are supported by the initiating client
and the drop site.Preregister Protocol.   In the "preregister" protocol,
the client that initiated the drag is in complete control of
the drag, and the clients controlling drop sites are never
notified when the drag icon enters those drop sites.
Therefore this protocol does not allow a drop site to
implement custom drag-under visuals.  In this protocol, the
client that initiated the drag grabs the X server and
implements the drag icon with a shaped window it moves
around the screen.  When the icon enters a top-level window,
the initiating client reads a server property to determine
the (preregistered) list of valid drop sites within that
window.  The initiating client can implement drag-over
visuals when the icon enters a drop site, and can also
implement simple drag-under visuals (such as highlighting
the drop-site border) for the drop site.Dynamic Protocol.   In the "dynamic" drag protocol, the
initiating client communicates (dynamically) with other
clients to determine the list of valid drop sites and to
notify then when the drag icon enters one of these drop
sites.  This notification allows these clients to implement
custom drag-under visuals (which can include animation). The
initiating client does not perform a server grab in this
protocol, and the drag icon is implemented by specifying it
as the hardware pointer.  Many X servers restrict the
maximum size of the pointer cursor, so this protocol may not
work with large drag icons.ID="S2-1013-5-9"Drop ProtocolThe drop protocol is primarily concerned with transferring the
data from initiator to receiver, and is much simpler than
the drag protocol.  It is based directly on the Xt Selection
mechanism used to implement standard Xt cut-and-paste.The drag initiator registers a "convert proc" (of type
XtConvertSelectionIncrProc) when it starts the drag
with XmDragStart().  In Xt selection terms, starting
a drag is analogous to calling XtOwnSelection().The receiving process registers each drop site along with a
callback to invoke when something is dropped on that site.
This callback registers a "transfer proc" (of type
XtSelectionCallbackProc) as well as a list of target
types that it would like the dragged data to be converted to
and calls XmDropTransferStart().  In terms of the Xt
selection mechanism, XmDropTransferStart() is
analogous to XtGetSelectionValues().
XmDropTransferStart() uses the underlying Xt
Selection mechanism to transfer the data.  The drag source's
convert proc is called once for each target type, and the
drop site's transfer proc is called once with the converted
data for each target.The drop protocol is also responsible for providing help.
Each drop site should recognize when the user has requested
help and post a dialog box explaining the consequences of
dropping on that site.  This dialog box must give the user
the explicit options to continue with or cancel the drop.ID="S2-1013-5-10"OperationsMotif allows three drag-and-drop operations: copy, move, and
link.  The precise semantics of each operation will of
course depend on the dragged data and the drop site.  After
a copy operation there should be two copies of the dragged
data or object.After a move, there should only be one copy.  Note that the
drop site is responsible for telling the drag source to
delete its copy of moved data.  It does this by sending a
request to convert the data to the special target "DELETE".
(This target is standardized by the ICCCM, described in Chapter 11.)The semantics of the "link" operation are vague: "At the end
of the operation, there is only one copy of the data,
belonging to the initiator, but both applications have
access to it".  In the absence of shared memory, it is not
clear what this means, but the link operation should
presumably be used to establish any sort of "live link",
or to enable dynamic data sharing between applications.ID="S2-1013-5-11"Application Programming InterfaceInitiating a drag or registering a drop site or initiating a
transfer once a drop has occurred each require a number of
parameters (many of which are optional) to be specified.  To
avoid having functions with large number of arguments, Motif
uses Xt Objects and allows these parameters to be specified
with standard Xt arglists.  Starting a drag with
XmDragStart() creates an object of type
XmDragContext.  Registering a drop site with
XmDropSiteRegister() creates an object of type
XmDropSite.  Initiating a data transfer with
XmDropTransferStart() creates an object of type
XmDropTransfer.  These objects have resources that control
many of the visual effects of drag-and-drop, and also have
callback list resources that provide hooks at many points
during both the drag and the drop.ID="S2-1013-5-12"Summary: Drag and Drop in ApplicationsProgramming with Motif drag-and-drop can become almost
arbitrarily complex (the code for a single example in OSF's book is
65 pages).  There are three general approaches to incorporating
drag-and-drop into applications:Do Nothing.  Many of the standard Motif primitive widgets support
drag-and-drop.  Even if you do nothing, users will be able
to perform basic drag-and-drop of text.Add New Drag Sources and Drop Types.  You can support additional drag sources by adding a
translation/action pair that calls XmDragStart() and
registers a convert proc to handle requests for the data
once it is dropped.  For example you might want to allow the
user to drag the value from a Slider widget, or if you
implemented a custom spreadsheet widget, you might want to
allow the user to drag a column of numbers.  To add a new
drop site, call XmDropSiteRegister() and specify a
callback to be called when a drop occurs.  This callback
should register a transfer proc to handle the dropped data
and then call XmDropTransferStart() to fetch that
data.Customize Drag-and-Drop.   There are many ways that
you can customize drag-and-drop, most of which can be
controlled through resources and callbacks. You can change
the components of the default drag icon, or specify custom
drag icon components for a particular drag source.  You can
also change the way that the components of the drag icon are
combined or "blended."  Using the XtNdragCallback
callback list of the XmDragContext 
and XmDropSite objects,
you can implements custom drag-over and drag-under visuals.
If a drag site implements custom visuals, you can set
resources to express a preference for the dynamic drag
protocol which allows these visuals.  You can specify a
non-rectangular outline for a drag site, and specify the
sort of highlighting should be done on that border when a
drag icon enters it.  You can specifying a stacking order
for overlapping drop sites.  You can only have one drop site
for a widget, but with some extra coding work, you can
implement a single drop site that appears and functions as a
number of separate sites within the widget.ID="S1-1013-5-10"Tear-off MenusMotif 1.2 supports tear-off menus.  A tear-off menu appears
with a dashed line across its top.  Selecting this dashed
line tears the menu off and allows the user to position it
with the mouse.  The torn-off menu becomes a top-level
window subject to window manager control.  Traversing to the
torn-off menu follows standard window manager policy.ID="IX-1013-5-61"tear off~menusBy default, menus do not allow themselves to be torn-off.
To enable this behavior, set the new RowColumn resource
XmNtearOffModel to XmTEAR_OFF_ENABLED.  To
disable it, set the resource to XmTEAR_OFF_DISABLED.
XmRepTypeInstallTearOffModelConverter() registers
the converter that allows this resource to be set from resource
files.  Note that some existing applications depend on receiving a
callback when a menu is mapped;
since torn-off menus are always mapped, these
applications might fail if a user is able to enable
tear-off menus from a resource file.ID="S1-1013-5-11"The Motif User Interface LanguageID="IX-1013-5-62"user interface languageUILID="IX-1013-5-63" SPAN="START"UILMotif is a hybrid of technology developed by DEC, Hewlett Packard,
IBM, and Microsoft.  DEC's contribution was the Application Programming
Interface (API) used in DECWindows.  This included
a tool called the User Interface Language, or UIL.UIL is a language for describing a Motif user interface.  It looks
similar to a programming language except that it has no control flow.
Part of it, stored in a separate library, is called the Motif
Resource Manager (MRM).  You specify your user interface in a
.uil file, and then write the callback functions in a .c
file.  The .c file is compiled in the standard fashion, and
linked with the -lMrm library (in addition to -lXt, -lXm,
and -lX11).  The .uil file has to be compiled
with a program called uil, to form a .uid file.The .c file is similar to a standard Xt application, but after
XtAppInitialize() you call MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay(), which
reads the .uid file to create the hierarchy of widgets.  The .c
file is primarily boilerplate, except for the callback functions for
the widgets in your application.

end module;The question is:  Should you develop your application with
pure C code or use UIL?The following is an attempt to weigh
the benefits and disadvantages of each programming method.UIL's benefits seem to be:MARK="BULLET"More complete separation of user interface description from
application code.  The former is in the .uil file, and the
latter in the .c file.  Theoretically, different programmers
can be working on each type of file, since they only interact in
the names of callback functions.Better compile time checking than standard Xt programming.
UIL checks your user-interface specification at compile
time to make sure you don't try to set resources that don't exist
on the widget you are setting them on, and checks that you are
using the right type of value.  It also issues a warning if you
create a child under a parent that doesn't support that type of
child.Forward references to widgets that have not yet been created are
allowed.  This can clarify a program, since the children of each
widget are listed where the widget is created.
In standard C code, you have to find out the variable of type
Widget for the geometry managing widget, and then search
throughout the code for widgets that use that widget as parent.Since the source code is boilerplate with the exception of callback
functions, the application needs compiling and linking less often.
The user interface can be modified by changing the .uil file,
and compiling it with uil, which is fast.Complete description of the widgets UIL knows about in a syntax called
the Widget Meta Language (WML).  As of Motif 1.2, UIL now supports
an extension that allows binary databases (WMD files) containing
WML information to be read at run time.  So custom widgets can be
included in UIL files, and they are subject to the same runtime
checking.UIL's disadvantages are:MARK="BULLET"You have to learn the UIL syntax.  If you want to
add custom widgets, you have to learn another syntax, WML, as well.Increase in executable file size.  While a Motif "hello, world"program using pure C programming is about 820K bytes in size on
my system,LINKEND="FN-1013-5-4" the
ID="FN-1013-5-4"A Sony NWS-841 workstation running BSD 4.3.
Note that this is already quite big enough!
same application is 1400K in size using UIL.  This size penalty is
serious from the point of view of disk space, loading time, and
memory utilization.  On systems with shared libraries, however,
there will be only one copy of the libraries in memory.  This solves
two of the above complaints, leaving only a slower linking
time at run time.When the callbacks in the .c module must be changed, you
have to recompile and relink, which
takes longer (without shared libraries)
than linking the same application using pure C programming.
In my experiment, using the time(1) utility built into
csh and /bin/time, the UIL version takes about
50 percent longer.  But as mentioned earlier, this is balanced by the
fact that the .c module has to be recompiled less often.Longer startup time of the finished application.When deciding whether to use UIL or standard C, it is also relevant
to consider the other programming tools available.  First of all there
are User Interface Management Systems (UIMSs) and Interface Development
Tools (IDTs) on the market.  These are programs that let you build your
user interface interactively, and then output either C code or UIL code
that describes the interface.  These eliminate the tedium of building
the interface in C, and eliminate the need to learn UIL's syntax.
UIMSs and IDTs also contain lists of Motif widgets and resources, but
since they output C code you can easily add your own custom widgets.Another tool worth researching is the Widget Creation Library (WCL),
ID="IX-1013-5-64"WCL toolkit aid
written by David Smyth and Martin Brunecky.  This library performs
a similar job as UIL, but allows you to specify the interface in
resource files instead of using UIL syntax.  This resource file is
read at run time and therefore does not require compiling.
The WCL library is much smaller than UIL.
There is a WCL tutorial in The X Resource, 
Issue 2, published by O'Reilly and Associates.LINKEND="FN-1013-5-5"ID="FN-1013-5-5"WCL is available via anonymous ftp from expo.lcs.mit.edu.

Much of this code is common to all widgets.  You can think of it
as a framework that Xt uses to implement a widget's features.
After reading this chapter, you should understand the
procedure for creating your own widget around this framework.ID="IX-1013-6-1" SPAN="START"widgetsinternalsID="IX-1013-6-2" SPAN="START"widgetsframework of codeThis chapter reveals the framework of code common to all widgets.
As an example, it describes the code for the BitmapEdit widget that was
used in versions of the xbitmap applications early in
Chapter 4, An Example Application.
Later examples in that chapter described
how to implement the bitmap editor without a BitmapEdit widget.
Therefore, you have already seen the code that is specific to this
widget, and can concentrate on the framework and how to place
widget-specific code within this framework.Some applications use only the standard user interface elements
defined in the widget set.  If you are writing an
application like this, you have no need to write your own widgets,
and no real need to understand the internals of widgets.  However,
many applications have at least one custom window which has features
not supported by any existing widget.  To implement such features,
you can add to a Core or Primitive widget from your application code
or you can write your own widget.Placing specialized user-interface code into a widget has several
advantages.  For one, the widget becomes a self-contained module
that can be modified and
documented separately and used in other programs.  Second, the code will
take advantage of Xt's automatic dispatching of events to widgets,
and several other features that you can't use from the
application.  Finally, it is a general premise of Xt that application
code should be separated as much as possible from user-interface code.It is important to remember that widget classes are never written
from scratch.  People always start from template files that contain
the framework for a widget without the specific code, or even better,
if possible, from an existing widget that has some similar
characteristics.  Therefore, you'll never have to type in the framework
you're about to see.  You'll only have to learn where to insert your
code into it.  The beauty of the widget framework is that the code
within it is very modular--each module has a specific place and
purpose.  Once you understand the framework, you can locate
these modules in existing code and use them as examples.  Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods,
shows you how to write the most important modules within the framework.ID="IX-1013-6-3"subclassingWriting your own widget is also known as subclassing a
widget, because you always build off the features of some
existing widget class.  It is possible to subclass
any existing widget, to add or modify features of the existing widget.
However, to subclass a widget with existing features, you have
to understand in detail how these features are implemented.
Therefore, subclassing a complicated widget such as Text is very
difficult.  To implement a custom window for an application,
it is normally sufficient to subclass Core or Primitive.By and large, a widget whose superclass is Core can operate under
any widget set without modification.  However, both the Motif widget
set and the OPEN LOOK widget set have Primitive classes beneath
Core that add some basic features common to all widgets in each set.
In the case of Motif, by subclassing from Primitive you get support
for keyboard traversal with highlighting, resolution independence,
shadows, Motif's automatic color selection, and a Help key callback.
These features are basic to Motif's
user-interface conventions, and therefore a widget that doesn't
use them would look out of place in a Motif application.
In order to inherit these features,
BitmapEdit is a subclass of Primitive;

Only BitmapEdit.c and
any modules that implement subclasses of BitmapEdit should include
BitmapEdiP.h.  If an application includes this file and
references any of its contents, it is breaking the rules of
encapsulation, and changes to this widget may affect the application.

application, for that matter) should have 12 or fewer
characters so that
the code can be copied easily to some System V systems.LINKEND="FN-1013-6-1"
That's why the "t" in BitmapEdiP.h is left out.
ID="FN-1013-6-1"These systems have a 14-character filename limit; the 12-character
limit allows files to be placed under source control or compressed.
The X Consortium keeps all filenames to a maximum of 12 characters.
That limits the actual class name to 9 characters, to leave room for
the P.h suffix.  If the widget class name is longer than 9
characters, it is truncated in the filename.  For example, the private
include file for the Constraint class is ConstrainP.h (without the
final t).The next three major sections describe the
contents of the three files that make up a widget.
These files are treated in the order shown in the above list
because they are generally developed in this order.ID="S1-1013-6-2"The Private Header File--BitmapEdiP.hID="IX-1013-6-18" SPAN="START"private header fileBitmapEdiP.hID="IX-1013-6-19" SPAN="START"widgetsprivate header fileID="IX-1013-6-20"classrecordID="IX-1013-6-21"instancerecordID="IX-1013-6-22"classhierarchy; widget classesID="IX-1013-6-23" SPAN="START"classstructureID="IX-1013-6-24" SPAN="START"instancestructuresXt implements classes and instances with two structures, the class
structure and the instance structure.  By definition of C
structures, the fields in both structures are fixed at
compile time.  Both of these structures are defined in the private
include file for the class, in this case BitmapEdiP.h.There is only one copy of the class structure in the running
application, which all instances share.  But each instance has its own
copy of the instance structure, whose fields are set by the resource
database as the instance is created.  Fields in the instance structure
can also be set by
XtVaSetValues() or read by XtVaGetValues().
ID="IX-1013-6-25"XtVaSetValuesID="IX-1013-6-26"XtVaGetValuesThe class structure's fields contain pointers to methods and pieces of
data that control how Xt handles instances of this class.ID="IX-1013-6-27"classrecord; contentsID="IX-1013-6-28"instancerecord; contents
The instance structure carries a complete widget state, including
everything that can be different between one instance and the next.
For example, the instance structure of the Core class, which
every widget inherits, has fields for
x, y, width, and height values,
which correspond to the size of the widget and its location
relative to the top-left corner of its parent.
These particular fields are public; they can be set
from the resource database or with XtVaSetValues(), and their
values can be read with XtVaGetValues().
Other instance structure fields are private, and are used only for
convenience to make data globally available within the widget.ID="IX-1013-6-29"methodsand instance structureActually, the instance structure is not global in the normal C sense.
When Xt invokes a method, it passes the method a pointer
to the widget instance structure.
Methods do their work by using the public fields and changing the
private fields in this
instance structure.  For example, a method that draws in
the window can get the window's dimensions directly
from the widget instance structure.
When action functions are called, they also are passed a pointer
to the instance structure.  Therefore, the fields inside the instance
structure are available just about everywhere in the widget code.ID="S2-1013-6-1"Parts and RecordsID="IX-1013-6-30" SPAN="START"inheritancein widget class and instance recordThe organization of both class and instance structures
is determined by the hierarchy of widget classes from which the
current widget class is derived.  For example, in the code for the
BitmapEdit widget whose class hierarchy is shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-06-1"Figure 6-1, the class structure begins with the class fields defined by
the Core class, followed by the class fields defined by Primitive,
followed by the class fields defined by BitmapEdit.ID="FG-1013-06-1"The class hierarchy of the BitmapEdit widget (with other classes shown dotted)FORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="06.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-6-1"ID="IX-1013-6-31"BitmapEdit widgetclass hierarchy ofID="IX-1013-6-32"Core widgetID="IX-1013-6-33"composite widgetsclassID="IX-1013-6-34"constraint widgetsclassID="IX-1013-6-35"classhierarchy; widget classesXt supplies three basic classes that are used as the basis for
custom widgets, Core, Composite, and Constraint.LINKEND="FN-1013-6-2"ID="FN-1013-6-2"Shell, the fourth Intrinsics-supplied widget class, is not
usually subclassed by application or widget programmers.LINKEND="FG-1013-06-1"Figure 6-1 also shows the relationship of these classes to each other.  Core is the class upon which all widgets are based.  It defines
common characteristics of all widgets, such as
their methods, and basic resources such as height and width.
Even if your widget is unlike any existing widget, it
will still inherit features from the Core widget.
The class and instance structures of a subclass of Composite such as
Box begin with the fields from Core, continue with fields from
Composite, and end with the fields defined by Box.
Composite and Constraint are subclasses of Core that have additional
methods that allow them to manage children; they
are described in Chapter 12, Geometry Management.
This chapter concentrates on the features of the Core widget.ID="IX-1013-6-36"part (vs. record)ID="IX-1013-6-37"classpart
Xt requires that you implement each class's new fields as a separate
structure called a Part, and then combine this Part
structure with each superclass's Part structure
in the complete structure called a Rec, or record.
In real code, these structures are called
widgetnameClassPart and
widgetnameClassRec for the class structure, and
simply widgetnamePart and widgetnameRec
for the instance structure.ID="IX-1013-6-38"classpart; combining into class recordThe reason for this "structure within a structure" design is
primarily to reduce the changes in
the code of subclasses that would be required if changes were made to
the superclass's structures.  As we will see later, only the portion
ID="IX-1013-6-39"superclassclass structure
of the .c file that initializes the class structure will need
changing if a superclass class structure is changed.
A second benefit of this design is that it reduces the amount of
typing required to implement a new class.
ID="IX-1013-6-40" SPAN="END"inheritancein widget class and instance recordID="S2-1013-6-2"Class Part and Class RecordLet's make these ideas concrete by showing the class structure
for BitmapEdit.  The complete class structure

to allow a subclass to choose to inherit a function or to replace it.
Most classes don't define fields here because they don't plan to
have subclasses.  This fine point is described in LINKEND="S2-1013-12-17"Section 12.4.5, "The class_part_init Method."ID="IX-1013-6-43"Core widgetCorePart structureID="IX-1013-6-44"Core widgetCoreClassPart structure
You need to include the private header file of the
superclass at the top of your private header file.
The CorePart and CoreClassPart structures
are defined in Core's private header file <X11/CoreP.h>, which
is included by <Xm/PrimitiveP.h>.

ID="IX-1013-6-47"include files
The header files begin with an
ifndef statement that allows the preprocessor to make sure
that no header file is included twice.If the class structure contains a pointer to an extension
structure, you can add to the class structure in later
releases of your widget and maintain binary compatibility
with subclasses.  This feature is used in the basic
Intrinsics classes Composite and Constraint, but is unlikely
to be useful to you.  However, when you do define an extension
structure, you do so in the private header file.
Extension structures are discussed in LINKEND="S1-1013-14-13"Section 14.13, "Class Extension Structures."ID="IX-1013-6-48"ifndef statementID="IX-1013-6-49"header filesnot included twiceID="IX-1013-6-50" SPAN="END"BitmapEdit widgetBitmapEditClassRecID="IX-1013-6-51" SPAN="END"classrecord; BitmapEdit widgetID="S2-1013-6-3"Instance Part and Instance RecordID="IX-1013-6-52" SPAN="START"instancerecord; BitmapEdit widgetID="IX-1013-6-53"BitmapEdit widgetinstance part and recordThe instance record is built exactly like the class structure:

fields, the instance part of a widget almost always defines new instance
variables.
These variables control all the configurable elements of the widget,
and they hold the widget's state.
ID="IX-1013-6-57"instancerecord; adding variables toID="IX-1013-6-58"resourcesin instance recordID="IX-1013-6-59"publicinstance variablesresources
Some of these instance variables are resources because they are
listed in the resource list in the BitmapEdit.c file.  (This
resource list has exactly the same format as the resource list you
saw in the application code in LINKEND="S2-1013-3-11"Section 3.6.2, "The Resource List").  These variables are
known as public instance variables (because they are readable and
writable from the application).  By convention, the public instance
variables are placed first in the instance part
structure, and comments indicate which fields are public.
When the application instantiates the widget, Xt sets the
public fields based on the resource databases, the command line (the -xrm
form), and the
argument list passed to XtVaCreateManagedWidget().  Later on, the
application may change these fields using XtVaSetValues().

listed in the widget's resource list) are either derived from
resource values or they hold
some aspect of the widget's state (such as whether it is highlighted).

the GC that actually carries color and font information to the X server.
GCs were introduced in LINKEND="S2-1013-4-3"Section 4.2.2, "Graphics from the Application."You may notice that the Part structures of the superclasses
are referenced in the BitmapEditRec structure.  As mentioned
earlier, you get these by including the private include file of the
immediate superclass, which in turn includes the private include file
of its own superclass, and so on.ID="IX-1013-6-66"XtVaCreateWidgetID="IX-1013-6-67"XtVaCreateManagedWidgetID="IX-1013-6-68"XtCreateWidgetID="IX-1013-6-69"XtCreateManagedWidgetID="IX-1013-6-70"typedefsID="IX-1013-6-71"instancerecord; allocating storage
Both the class and instance structures defined in
BitmapEdiP.h are typedef templates; they do not allocate
storage.  Xt allocates storage for the instance record
when the application calls XtVaCreateWidget() or
XtVaCreateManagedWidget() to create the
widget.  The class record, on the other hand, is initialized
statically (at compile time) in the .c file.
ID="IX-1013-6-72"classrecord; allocating storage
The compiler makes sure that the definition of the class record (in
BitmapEdiP.h)
and the initialization of the class record (in BitmapEdit.c) use
identical structures, since BitmapEdit.c includes
BitmapEdiP.h.
If a field is accidentally left out of
the class structure in either file, the compiler will catch the
problem (but if the same member is left out of both files, the
problem won't be caught and Xt will likely dump core).BitmapEdiP.h contains an extern
reference to the class structure initialized in BitmapEdit.c.
This reference is shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-06-3"Example 6-3.ID="EX-1013-06-3"BitmapEdiP.h: declaring the external class recordextern BitmapEditClassRec bitmapEditClassRec;Because the private header file includes the public header file, there
is no obvious reason for this extern declaration.  But since
all widget code seems to have it, we go along with the
convention.ID="IX-1013-6-73"conventionswidget; structure declarationsThe naming conventions for the various structure declarations
in the private header file are important, and can be
confusing.  A table summarizing the conventions for types and variables
in the widget implementation files is shown in LINKEND="S1-1013-6-6"Section 6.6, "Summary of Conventions" (after
the contents of the .c and .h files are shown).That's all there is in the private header file!
If you should need to refer back to the
private header file for BitmapEdit, it is listed with the rest of the
source for the widget in Appendix E, The xbitmap Application.

file is the initialization of the class record.  Remember that
the typedef of the class record was declared in
BitmapEdiP.h, but the record is allocated and the
actual values in each field are set
in BitmapEdit.c.  When Xt takes over control of
the widgets after the application calls XtAppMainLoop(), it
is the values in this class record that supply Xt with all the
information it uses to manage widget instances.
ID="IX-1013-6-77"XtAppMainLoopThe organization of the .c file is quite simple.  First, it
defines everything that will be placed into the class record, and then
initializes the class record, setting fields using these
definitions.  The major things that need defining are the functions
that implement each method,
the resource list, the translation table, and the actions table.
It would be logical to define these four things at the beginning of
the source file, and then put the class record last.  This is almost
the case, except that by convention
the methods and actions are declared at the top of the source file
and then defined
at the end after the class record initialization.  This actually
makes the widget code clearer because the method declarations
provide a complete list of the methods that will be defined later in
the file, and the class record remains near the top of the file where
it's easier to find.  (Not all the methods have to be defined by a class,
because some methods can be inherited or not used,
as we will discuss in LINKEND="S2-1013-6-9"Section 6.3.6, "Description of Core Methods.")
LINKEND="FG-1013-06-2"Figure 6-2 summarizes the conventional order of code in the .c file.LINKEND="FN-1013-6-3"ID="FN-1013-6-3"Here we use the terminology defined in Kernighan and Ritchie's
The C Programming Language (Prentice-Hall 1978).
A declaration announces the properties of a variable (its type,
size, etc.), while a definition causes storage to be allocated.

A widget resource list is identical to an application resource list,
which you saw added to xbitmap in Chapter 4.
The only difference is that a widget need not call
XtGetApplicationResources().In creating an application resource list, we created a structure
called app_data whose fields were to be set through resources.
In widget code, the instance part structure is used just like
app_data, except that the private instance structure fields
will not appear in the resource list.  Each member of the instance

in Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion.As mentioned earlier, a widget class inherits all the resources
defined in the resource lists of its superclasses.  If a resource
is given the same name as a superclass resource, it overrides the
superclass resource.  One reason to create a new resource
with the same name as a superclass resource is to give it a new,
subclass-specific default value.  The Primitive widget does this to
replace Xt's default value for XmNbackground and
XmNbackgroundPixmap.  Another reason is to provide
further processing on a resource value.  For example, Primitive
redefines the XmNx and XmNy resources so that it
can add code to calculate these values using the current unit type
(to implement resolution independence).When defining a resource list, use constants

needed in most applications or widgets.

string action names, and the action table then maps string action names
into actual action functions.  This is done in two steps so that
the translation table is a single string that can be specified in
the resource databases (since resource databases are always composed
entirely of strings).  The action table is not configurable through
the resource database, but it can be added to the application or
with XtAppAddAction(s).
ID="IX-1013-6-115"XtAppAddActionsLike the resource list, the default translation table and the actions
table have to be defined before the class record can be initialized.
They determine which events this widget
will respond to, and which functions defined in this source file will be
triggered by those events.The translation table is a resource defined by the Core class.
It is a strange resource in several ways.  It has no default
value in the resource list.  Instead, the default translation
table is initialized into the class structure.
Translations are not inherited like other resources--you do not
get the sum of all the translation tables registered by the
superclasses.  Rather, the translation table you specify in the class
structure is the only one (in the code) that matters.  However, you
can choose to use the immediate superclass's translation
table instead of defining one, in which case you initialize the
translation table field in the class structure to be
XtInheritTranslations.
ID="IX-1013-6-116"translationsinheritanceID="IX-1013-6-117"actionswidget/application conflictsEach widget has its own action list, and if the application registers
an action list, it is kept as a separate list.
When an event combination occurs in a
widget, Xt translates the event combination into an action string and
searches that widget's action list.  If the action string is found in
the widget's action list, the search stops and that action function
is called. If the action string is not found in the widget's action
list, then the application's action list is searched.  If neither
list contains the appropriate action string, Xt prints a diagnostic
warning.  If the application and the widget both define the same
action string in the actions table, the application's function mapped
to that string will never be called.  Two widget classes, however,
may have the same action function name, and they will not conflict.LINKEND="EX-1013-06-7"Example 6-7 shows a default translation table and an action table.  Note that, like methods, the action functions are
declared before being used in the actions table, but they will
actually be defined later in the source file.

calls a certain Xt function.  For example, when an application
creates a widget with
XtVaCreateManagedWidget() (or any similar call), Xt calls the
initialize method of that widget class.  There are separate
methods called when Expose events occur, when
XtVaSetValues() is called, and when XtDestroyWidget() is
called.
Methods are distinct from actions in that methods are called in
response to application function calls and Expose events,
while actions are usually called in response to user-selectable events.
Methods also each have their own field in the class structure,
while actions are listed in a table that is stored in one
field of the class structure.  Pointers to action functions are placed
in an action table which is
then entered into the class structure, while a pointer to each method
function is entered directly into its field of the class structure.The widget's methods should be declared near the top of the .c
file.  This is so that the class structure initialization can appear
before the method definitions.
As usual in C, they should be declared as the actual type returned,
such as void or Bool.LINKEND="FN-1013-6-4"They should be declared
static so that the scope of these variables is limited to this source

A major part of the work is done.  Now we just need
to insert the method names we declared earlier into the

the BitmapEdit class record includes class parts for BitmapEdit itself

There are several issues regarding methods that require separate

widget can.  This method is called immediately after the
get_values method, and is for performing the same
operations except on subparts.

The compress_motion, compress_exposure, and
compress_enterleave fields control the Toolkit's event
filters.  Basically, these filters remove events that some widgets
can do without, thus improving performance.  Unless a widget performs
complicated drawing or tracks the pointer, compress_exposure
should usually be XtExposeCompressMultiple and the other two
fields should usually be True.  These filters are
described in Chapter 9, More Input Techniques.ID="IX-1013-6-159"Core widgetfields; visible_interestID="IX-1013-6-160"visibility interest
The visible_interest field can be set to True if your
widget wishes to get VisibilityNotify events, which signal
changes in the visibility of your widget.  Normally this is set to
False, because Expose events cause the widget to be
redrawn at the proper times.  For some widgets, however,
Expose events are not enough.  If your widget draws
continuously, as in a game, it can stop computing output for
areas that are no longer visible.  There are other cases where
VisibilityNotify events are useful.

Xt uses the version field to check the compiled
widget code against the library the widget is linked against.  If
you specify the constant XtVersion and it is different
from the version used by the libraries,
then Xt displays a run-time warning message.
However, if you have intentionally designed a widget
to run under more than one version of Xt, you can specify the constant
XtVersionDontCheck.

widget while maintaining binary compatibility.  When used, it is a
pointer to an extension structure containing additional class
structure fields.The fields in the Primitive class part are there so that
subclasses like BitmapEdit can inherit or replace certain features of
Primitive.  We are happy to inherit the relevant ones, and disable
the rest by setting them to zero or NULL as appropriate.
We inherit the border_highlight, border_unhighlight,
and translations fields so that BitmapEdit can highlight
itself and be a tab group.  However, we turned these features off in the
application that uses BitmapEdit (by setting XmNtraversalOn
to False in xbitmap1) since there is not
yet a keyboard interface for navigating within the bitmap.
ID="IX-1013-6-167" SPAN="END"Core widgetclass part; initializingID="S3-1013-6-2"Initializing the Core MethodsAs you've just seen, there are several places for pointers to methods
stored in the Core class structure.  We will describe the purpose
of each of these methods in the next section.  But first, a word
about how to set the method fields.Fortunately, the Core
class already defines some of the methods, and you can choose to
inherit them instead of writing your own.  In general, when
you set out to write a widget, you will pick as your superclass the
widget that has the most methods that you can inherit instead of
writing from scratch.ID="IX-1013-6-168"inheritancestylesID="IX-1013-6-169"chained methodsinheritanceID="IX-1013-6-170"self-contained methodsinheritance
Broadly speaking, there are two types of methods, self-contained
methods and chained methods.A self-contained method is one that
is called alone--the methods of the same name in the widget's superclasses
are not called.  For example, expose is self-contained.
When you write the expose method, you are writing all the
drawing code for the widget.  The expose method of the
superclass will not be called even if it was designed to do drawing.
Therefore, by writing an expose method you replace the
expose method of the superclass.A chained method is one that is not called alone--it is called either
before or after all the methods of the same name in its superclasses and
subclasses.  Therefore, you can't replace any of the code in this
method in the subclasses or superclasses, you can only add to
it by writing your own.ID="IX-1013-6-171"inheritanceof self-contained methodsInheritance works differently for chained and self-contained methods.
For self-contained methods, such as realize and expose,
ID="IX-1013-6-172"realize methodID="IX-1013-6-173"exposemethod
inheritance works almost as it does for default translations.
When initializing a field in the class record that represents a
self-contained method, you have three choices:MARK="BULLET"You can define these methods in your widget code
by placing the name of the function in the class record and defining
that function somewhere in the source file.You can inherit that method from the immediate superclass by
placing a special symbol beginning with XtInherit in that field
in the class record.
ID="IX-1013-6-174"XtInherit constantsID="IX-1013-6-175"inheritanceusing XtInherit constantsYou can use the first technique, but reference the superclass's
method in your method.  This allows you to add features to the
superclass's method without having to completely copy it and modify it.These techniques are demonstrated in LINKEND="S2-1013-6-9"Section 6.3.6, "Description of Core Methods."ID="IX-1013-6-176"inheritanceof self-contained methodsID="IX-1013-6-177"downward chainingID="IX-1013-6-178"upward chainingID="IX-1013-6-179"inheritanceof chained methods
Chained methods, on the other hand, use one of two
flavors of inheritance.  Some are downward
chained, which means that the Core method is called first, followed
by the same method in each subclass.
Other methods are upward chained, which
means that the Core class method is called last.
For both upward and downward chained methods, your choice is whether
to specify additional code by defining your own method, or to go with
what the other classes have already defined.  You cannot prevent the
code from the other classes from being executed.Here is how chaining works for the initialize method
in BitmapEdit.  Remember that BitmapEdit is a subclass of Primitive
and then Core.  The
Core class record contains only the Core part structure.
The Primitive class record contains the Core part structure and the
Primitive part structure.
The BitmapEdit class record contains the Core, Primitive, and BitmapEdit
part structures.  The initialize method is present in the Core
part structure of all three classes.  When an application creates an
instance of the BitmapEdit widget, Xt calls the
function specified in the initialize field in the Core class
record first, followed by the one in the Primitive class record,
and finally the one in the BitmapEdit class record.
This is an example of downward chaining.
ID="IX-1013-6-180"inheritanceof chained methodsThe destroy method, on the other hand, is upward chained. That
is, the destroy method in BitmapEdit would be called first,
followed by the destroy method for Primitive, and finally the
one for Core.If you specify NULL in your class structure for a method that
chains upward or downward, it is equivalent to specifying a
function that does nothing.  The function for that method of the
superclasses and subclasses will still be called normally.
ID="IX-1013-6-181"inheritanceof chained methodsLINKEND="TB-1013-6-2"Table 6-2 lists which methods fall into each type of

and where in this book the method will be described in detail.
All these methods, except realize, can be set to NULL
in the class record and the widget will still function.
However, all widgets that draw into their window will also require
the expose method, the initialize method, and usually
the resize method.  And to be good children, widgets should
define a query_geometry method.  The realize
method is shown in LINKEND="S2-1013-6-9"Section 6.3.6, "Description of Core Methods," and the rest of
the commonly-used methods immediately after that
in Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods.This list describes all the methods, even those that are rarely
used.  There is a lot of detail here that you should not expect
to absorb in a first reading.  Like the list of Core class structure
fields, treat this as an introduction and come back to it later for

method to do it.MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-6-186"methodsinitializeID="IX-1013-6-187"methodsinitializeinitialize sets initial values for all the fields in the

own methods in their class part (but is not present in Core, Composite,

perhaps multiple, times.  The set_values method is downward

ID="IX-1013-6-223" SPAN="END"methodsaboutID="S2-1013-6-10"Packaging the Class Record for Application UseThe final requirement of the .c file is a pointer to the class

in the chapter that discusses that job.  However, we'll describe the
realize method now, because it is simple and demonstrates the
two techniques of inheriting for self-contained fields that were
described in LINKEND="S3-1013-6-2"Section 6.3.5.2, "Initializing the Core Methods." The realize method is responsible for creating the widget's

The first technique is to inherit wholesale the method defined by the
immediate superclass.  The superclass may have its own realize
method, or it may also inherit the method from its superclass, and
so on.  The Core widget's realize method creates a basic window.LINKEND="FN-1013-6-6"ID="FN-1013-6-6"ID="IX-1013-6-229"windowWindowObj classID="IX-1013-6-230"RectObjID="IX-1013-6-231"Core widgethidden superclasses
If you have the source code for Xt, you may discover that the Core
widget is actually an amalgamation of several other superclasses
called WindowObj, RectObj, and so on.  (You might also notice the
include files for these classes in /usr/include/X11.)  The Core
widget actually inherits the realize procedure from WindowObj.
These classes are an implementation detail that
will affect you only if you want to look in some of these
superclasses to find the code that implements features normally
attributed to Core.  From application code or widget code, it is
always safe to assume that Core is the top of the class tree.
For gadgets, you need to know more about these
"hidden" classes, so we'll discuss them in Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups.
In your subclasses of any of these widgets, you can inherit the Core
realize method without modification by initializing the
realize member of the Core class record to the symbolic
constant XtInheritRealize, as shown in
ID="IX-1013-6-232"XtInherit constantsXtInheritRealizeLINKEND="EX-1013-06-12"Example 6-12.ID="EX-1013-06-12"BitmapEdit.c: inheriting a self-contained methodBitmapEditClassRec bitmapEditClassRec = {

};Xt also defines symbolic constants for inheriting for every other
self-contained method.  They all begin with XtInherit, and
in general continue with the capitalized name of the method field.
ID="IX-1013-6-233"conventionsfor XtInherit constantsID="IX-1013-6-234"window attributesaboutAn important
part of the process of creating an X window is the setting of
window attributes.  Therefore, a brief aside on window attributes is
necessary.  (You can skim the next page if you are already familiar
with them.)Window attributes are basic features of
the way the server makes windows look and act.  Window attributes
can also be changed later if necessary, but the realize
method is the place to set them initially.  The Core
class realize method sets some basic window attributes such
as the window background and border colors or patterns, and it gets
these values from Core resources.  Here is a list of the
window attributes that you may wish to set:
ID="IX-1013-6-235" SPAN="START"drawingwindow attributesBackgroundID="IX-1013-6-236"backgroundwindow attributeID="IX-1013-6-237"window attributesbackground

Provides hints about when a window's contents should be preserved
by the server even when the window is obscured or unmapped.
This is useful for widgets that are very time-consuming to redraw.
Not all servers are capable of maintaining a backing store.
Check the value returned from the Xlib DoesBackingStore macro
to determine whether this feature is supported on a particular screen
on your server.

Provides hints about whether or not the screen area beneath a
window should be saved while a window such as
a popup menu is in place, to save obscured windows from
having to redraw themselves when the popup is
removed.
Not all servers can save under windows.
You can find out whether this feature is supported on a particular
screen with the Xlib DoesSaveUnders macro.

Determines which virtual colormap should be used for this window.
ID="IX-1013-6-252"virtual colormaps
If your widget requires a lot of specific colors--for example, to draw a
shaded image, it may need to create its own virtual colormap.  In
that case, it would set this attribute to the ID of the created
colormap.  For more information, see Chapter 7, Color, in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.CursorID="IX-1013-6-253"cursorwindow attributeID="IX-1013-6-254"window attributescursorID="IX-1013-6-255"cursorabout
Determines which cursor should be displayed when the pointer is in
this window.  You must create this cursor before setting this attribute.
This can be done with a standard type converter,
as described in Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques.
ID="IX-1013-6-256" SPAN="END"drawingwindow attributesIt may clarify the picture to describe the features that
window attributes do not affect.
Setting the window attributes does not determine a window's
parent, depth, or visual.  These are all set when a window is created,
and are permanent.
The window attributes are also not used for setting the size, position,
or border width of a widget.  These are set using XtSetValues().
Window attributes do not determine how graphics requests are interpreted;
this is the job of the graphics context (GC).
ID="IX-1013-6-257"graphics contextsaboutID="IX-1013-6-258"XtSetValuesNote that some of the window attributes are not listed here because they
should not be set directly by widgets, in the realize method or
anywhere else.  These include the event_mask,
ID="IX-1013-6-259"window attributesevent_maskID="IX-1013-6-260"eventsevent masks; window attribute
which controls which events are sent to this widget.  Xt itself
sets this window attribute based on the translation table.
Another is override_redirect, which
is handled by the Shell widget.
ID="IX-1013-6-261"overridingredirect; window attributeID="IX-1013-6-262"window attributesoverride_redirectYou could write a realize method that set your desired
attributes and then called XtCreateWindow().  But this
is slightly wasteful, since Core already has a realize
method that creates a window and you can take advantage of it.
This is the second inheritance scheme used for self-contained
fields.  You define your own realize method just as if you
ID="IX-1013-6-263"realize method
were going to write it from scratch, but then you call
the superclass's realize method directly, as shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-06-13"Example 6-13.

ID="IX-1013-6-268"window attributesYou may wonder what happens if the
superclass also inherited its realize method--does the code
in
LINKEND="EX-1013-06-13"Example 6-13 crash by assuming the superclass field
contains a function pointer when it actually contains the constant
XtInheritRealize?  No.  When the class is initialized, Xt
reconciles all the inherited methods and resets the class record
fields to be pointers to the right methods.

What is happening behind the scenes when you inherit the
realize method is that the Core realize method calls
the Toolkit function XtCreateWindow(), which in turn calls the
Xlib function XCreateWindow().  You may need to call the Xlib
routine yourself in the realize method if
you want to use a visual other than the default.
See the reference page for XCreateWindow() in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, and
Chapter 7, Color, in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, for details on depth, visual,
and the issue of color in general.

record pointer used by applications in calls to

BitmapEditWidget.  Xt calls all methods and actions with
an argument of type Widget.  To access any of the fields
in the instance structure, this pointer must be cast to type
BitmapEditWidget.  The easiest way to do this is to declare the
argument of the method as type BitmapEditWidget
(the other way is to cast in an assignment).ID="IX-1013-6-278"resourcesXmN constantsIf your resource list uses XmN, XmC, or XmR
constants not defined in <Xm/Xm.h>(<X11/StringDefs.h> for standard Xt applications), you must define
them in the public include file.  The definitions should have only a
single space between the definition and the value, with no trailing
comment or space.  This reduces the possibility of compiler warnings
from similar but not identical definitions in multiple classes.
If you want, you can use a different convention for the symbol names,
to distinguish your constants from those defined by Motif.  For example,
you could start them all with Xo.ID="IX-1013-6-279"publicfunctionsIf a widget offers any public functions,
they would be declared extern here (and actually defined in the .c
file).  Public functions allow the application
to read or change certain private data in certain more restricted or
more convenient ways than is possible with resources.  For example,
the BitmapEdit widget provides the public function
BitmapEditGetArray that
applications can call to get the array of bits currently stored
as private data in the widget.  (This array is an attribute
readable with XtGetValues(), but using this function is more
convenient because it also returns the dimensions of the array.)LINKEND="EX-1013-06-14"Example 6-14 shows BitmapEdit's public header file.ID="EX-1013-06-14"BitmapEdit.h: complete public header file#ifndef _ORABitmapEdit_h

They are:MARK="BULLET"Copy all three files of an existing widget.  If you are subclassing
Core or XmPrimitive, it is generally easiest to copy the files
of another subclass of Core or XmPrimitive, preferably the one
most similar to the one you
intend to write; pick one that has many methods defined so
that you don't need to type them in.  (It's easier to delete than
to retype.)  If you are subclassing a widget that has no existing
subclasses, then you can use any set of widget template files.
There is a widget in the Athena widget set called Template that is
for this purpose.Globally change the widget class name in the files.  The fastest way to
do this under UNIX is with sed, using a script similar to
the following:ID="SC-1013-6-1"s/BitmapEdit/NewName/g
s/bitmapEdit/newName/gPlace this script in the file sedscr, and run the command:ID="SC-1013-6-2"spike% sed -f sedscr file > newfileon each file.  (Or write a simple for loop to run it on
multiple files.)Start from the top of the .c file, and begin
by writing the resource list.
While writing the resource list, you may
need to edit the public header file to define new resource names and
classes (XmN and XmC symbols).  While writing the
resource list (and during the entire widget-writing process), you will
also need to edit the private header file in order
to add and remove instance part
structure fields, as you determine a need for them while writing
methods and actions.  Later you will probably discover additional
parameters that you want to define as resources.Design the output you expect your widget to draw.  Your instance
part structure fields must hold all the information necessary to
redraw everything when the window is exposed--add the necessary fields.ID="IX-1013-6-283"drawingbitmap cellsDesign the user input you expect your widget to accept.
Start with as many separate actions as you can--one for each
distinguishable user input idiom.  For example, BitmapEdit has three
actions for changing one bitmap cell:  DrawCell,
UndrawCell, and ToggleCell.  Even though these invoke
almost identical underlying code, it is best to keep them as separate
actions.Design a default translation table to have these actions called in
response to the appropriate events.  Help in this area is available
in LINKEND="S2-1013-8-2"Section 8.1.2, "Selecting the Events to Translate."Write the expose method and actions.  How to do
this is described in the next chapter.  But in summary, both
the expose method and actions often draw into the widget.
The expose method must always be
able to redraw what the actions drew.  Therefore, it usually pays
to have common elements of code called by both an action and the
expose method.  Neither the action nor the expose
method pass arguments to this common code.  Instead, the actions
set instance variables that are read in the expose
method or common code.  The instance variables act as global
variables because they are available almost everywhere in the widget
code.Add parameters that allow your
drawing code to work smoothly in any size window, and add a
resize method that sets these parameters.Add the initialize method to check resource values that
might have been user supplied and to initialize private instance
variables.Add the set_values method to check application-supplied
resource values and reset private instance variables based on
the new resource values.Declare the methods and actions you have defined, near the top of the .c file.Enter all these functions and tables you have defined into the class
structure initialization.It is useful to have a simple application available for testing
your widget as you develop it.  One that simply creates the widget
under construction and provides a Quit button is quite adequate.
Then you can add code to the widget incrementally, assuring at each
step that the program compiles, links, and runs without error.As this list implies, it is a good idea to start simply by completing
all the above steps for a small subset of the features you eventually
want.  Once you have a working widget that you can test,
you can add features one at a time by going through the list
again.  If instead you attempt to write an ambitious widget in one pass,
you will spend much longer debugging it.Once you have learned how to write methods and actions in the next
chapter, Basic Widget Methods, you should be ready to write a simple
widget.ID="S1-1013-6-6"Summary of ConventionsID="IX-1013-6-284"conventionswidget; structure declarationsID="IX-1013-6-285"widgetsdefining conventions; summaryThe naming conventions for the various structure declarations

set_values, resize, query_geometry, and destroy methods.  It
explains when Xt calls each method, and describes in detail
what should be in each of these methods.
Among other things, these methods prepare for
and do the drawing of graphics that appear in a widget.
This chapter describes what the Toolkit adds to the graphics model
provided by Xlib, but does not describe in detail how to draw using
Xlib; this topic is described in Chapters 5, 6 and 7
of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.
This chapter also describes how to write action routines that
work in the widget framework.This chapter describes the initialize, expose,
set_values, resize, query_geometry,
and destroy methods.  These are the
methods you need to write to make a functioning widget (although
destroy is optional).  The common thread in most of these
methods is that they have a role in drawing graphics, although all but
the expose method are also responsible for other things.
We will describe all the responsibilities of these methods, but
focus on the issues involving graphics because they are so important.
Additional examples of each method are shown on the reference pages for 
each method in Section 4 of Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual.ID="IX-1013-7-1"XtCreateWidgetID="IX-1013-7-2"methodsinitializeID="IX-1013-7-3"methodsinitialize; calling XInternAtomID="IX-1013-7-4"destroy methodID="IX-1013-7-5"methodsdestroyID="IX-1013-7-6"set_values methodID="IX-1013-7-7"methodsset_valuesID="IX-1013-7-8"exposemethodID="IX-1013-7-9"methodsexposeID="IX-1013-7-10"XtDestroyWidgetID="IX-1013-7-11"XtVaSetValues

all of a widget's window becomes newly visible on the screen.LINKEND="FN-1013-7-1"ID="FN-1013-7-1"ID="IX-1013-7-20"exposeExpose eventsNote that Expose events
are also handled through the translation mechanism like any other
event.  When they are present in the translation table, the action
registered for Expose events will be called in addition to
the expose method.  Widgets do not normally include the
Expose event in their translation table, because they
already have the expose method.  Applications might, conceivably,
have Expose in their translation table to add drawing
capability to a widget, although it is difficult to calculate where
to do this drawing from the application since the widget's size may
change.ID="IX-1013-7-21"methodsquery_geometryID="IX-1013-7-22"methodsquery_geometry; about
When the parent widget, which is usually a geometry-managing
Composite or Constraint widget, needs to resize one of its
children, it may call the child's query_geometry method
to find the child's opinion of the proposed change.  Once the
parent has actually resized the child, Xt calls the child's
resize method, which is responsible for calculating
private instance variables, so that the child is prepared to
redraw itself in its new window size.

widgets.  Although it is possible to create normal X windows
and draw into them from the application code, you lose the advantage
of Xt's event dispatching, event filtering, and other features.
It's just as easy to draw in a widget, and it's easier to add
processing of user input as described in
Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators.ID="S1-1013-7-1"The X Graphics Model Inside WidgetsLINKEND="S2-1013-4-3"Section 4.2.2, "Graphics from the Application" described the X graphics model and how drawing
from the application is accomplished.  In summary, the process
consisted of creating GCs and then drawing from a function
that Xt calls on receipt of Expose events.  Drawing from
inside a widget follows the same general procedure, but the code is
organized differently.ID="IX-1013-7-27"graphics contextscachingID="IX-1013-7-28"XtGetGCID="IX-1013-7-29"XCreateGC Xlib function
Inside a widget, you normally create GCs with the Xt routine
XtGetGC() or XtAllocateGC instead of the Xlib routine
ID="IX-1013-7-30"XtGetGCID="IX-1013-7-31"XtAllocateGCID="IX-1013-7-32"sharing GCsID="IX-1013-7-33"GCssharing between instancesXCreateGC().
XtGetGC() is similar to the Xlib routine except that it
arranges for the sharing of GCs among widgets within an application.
This is important because
each GC has some overhead and servers can achieve better
performance when handling fewer GCs.  Because Xt applications often
have many instances of the same widget class, each needing the same
GC characteristics (unless the user specifies a different color for
each one), Xt arranges for them to share GCs when possible.
The drawback with XtGetGC() is that no instance is allowed
to modify the returned GC, because some other widget instance may
be depending on it.
XtAllocateGC() supports more flexible sharing.  You specify
which fields your widget wants the ability to change, and those
that it doesn't care about, so that some other widget may get the
same GC if it only needs to change the latter fields.ID="IX-1013-7-34"graphics contextscreatingID="IX-1013-7-35"drawingin expose methodID="IX-1013-7-36"methodsdrawing; in exposeID="IX-1013-7-37"methodsinitializeID="IX-1013-7-38"methodsinitialize; calling XInternAtomID="IX-1013-7-39"methodsexpose
Xt organizes GC creation and drawing into separate methods.
Setting initial values for the GC and creating the GC is
done in the initialize method, and actual
drawing is done in the expose method.
This makes it very easy to find this code in existing widgets and
straightforward to write this code for new widgets.ID="IX-1013-7-40"XtVaSetValuesID="IX-1013-7-41"methodsset_valuesID="IX-1013-7-42"set_values method
Since Xt allows resources to be changed during program
execution by calling XtVaSetValues(), the widget code must be
prepared to change the GC at any time if the GC components depend on
resource values.
The set_values method calculates the new values
based on resource changes and updates the appropriate GCs.The next six major sections discuss the code needed to implement the
initialize, expose, set_values,
resize, query_geometry, and destroy methods.ID="S1-1013-7-2"The initialize MethodID="IX-1013-7-43" SPAN="START"initialize methodID="IX-1013-7-44"initialize methodaboutID="IX-1013-7-45"instancestructuresID="IX-1013-7-46"widgetsinstance structureID="IX-1013-7-47" SPAN="START"methodsinitializeID="IX-1013-7-48" SPAN="START"methodsinitialize; calling XInternAtomID="IX-1013-7-49" SPAN="START"widgetsmanagement; childAs described in LINKEND="S3-1013-6-2"Section 6.3.5.2, "Initializing the Core Methods," the initialize method

(also called instance variables).LINKEND="FN-1013-7-2"ID="FN-1013-7-2"As described in Chapter 12, Geometry Management,
the initialize method can also be used for creating
child widgets, to build a compound widget.  This is a way of getting
around Xt's geometry management scheme, and is not frequently done.ID="IX-1013-7-50"resourceschecking validity
This job has two parts:  setting the initial values of private instance
variables, and checking to make sure that the values of the
public instance variables are valid (since they are user
configurable).  Since the initialize method is upward chained
(defined in LINKEND="S3-1013-6-2"Section 6.3.5.2, "Initializing the Core Methods"), the method for this class needs to
initialize only the fields present in the instance part structure for
this class.  The exceptions are width and
height.  Even though they are instance variables of Core,
they need to be checked by the subclass,
because only this class knows its desired
initial size.

particular to BitmapEdit, the techniques are common to all
initialize methods.  Some private instance variables, such as
cur_x and cur_y, do not depend on resource settings and
are simply initialized to a fixed value.  Public instance variables
are checked; if their values are out of range, XtWarning()
is called to print a message on the standard output and they are instead
initialized to a fixed value.  Some private instance variables
are set based on public instance variables.  GCs are the most common
example.As you should recall from Chapter 6, Inside a Widget, all the variables set in
initialize are declared in the BitmapEditPart instance
structure in the private header file.Note that most of the arguments of initialize are rarely
used.  When initialize is called, the request
argument is an instance structure containing the same values as
new.  But as new is changed, request
provides a sometimes useful record of the resource settings
originally made by the user.  The args and num_args
arguments contain the resource settings provided in the call to
XtVaCreateManagedWidget().  These are sometimes useful in
distinguishing between settings made by the application (args)
from settings made by the user (which already appear in new and
request).  The code in the initialize_hook
method, described in Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion, can optionally be placed in the
initialize method.ID="S2-1013-7-1"Creating GCsID="IX-1013-7-56"graphics contextscreatingIn any widget that does drawing, some of the private instance variables

LINKEND="EX-1013-07-2"Example 7-2 shows these routines.ID="IX-1013-7-58"XGCValues structureA program prepares for creating a GC by setting the desired
characteristics of the GC into members of a large structure called
XGCValues (defined by Xlib),
and specifying which members of XGCValues
it has provided by setting a bitmask.  This bitmask is made by ORing
the GC mask symbols defined in <X11/X.h>.  Each bitmask symbol
represents a member of the XGCValues structure.
Every GC field has a default value, so only those values that differ
from the default need to be set.
The default GC values are discussed in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.ID="IX-1013-7-59"XtGetGCWidget code normally creates a GC with the XtGetGC() call,
not the Xlib analogue XCreateGC().
XtGetGC() keeps track of requests to get GCs
by all the widgets in an application, and creates new server
GCs only when a widget requests a GC with different values.
In other words, after the first widget creates a GC with
XtGetGC(), any subsequent widget that calls XtGetGC() to
create a GC with the same values will get the same GC, not a new one.
Using this client-side caching also reduces the number of requests to
the server.

Xlib provides XChangeGC() to change the values in an existing GC.
Xt provides no analogue.  Because of the sharing of GCs
allocated with XtGetGC(), you must treat them as read-only.
If you don't, you may confuse or break other widgets.
In cases where your widget creates a GC that needs changing in such a
way that it is impractical to create a new GC each time, it may be
appropriate to use the Xlib call XCreateGC() instead of the
Xt call XtGetGC().ID="IX-1013-7-65"depthID="IX-1013-7-66"XtGetGCwhen not to use
BitmapEdit must use XCreateGC() for two of its three GCs because
these GCs are for drawing into pixmaps of depth 1, while XtGetGC()
always creates GCs for drawing into windows or pixmaps of the
default depth of the screen.  In other words, XtGetGC() would
work on a monochrome screen, but not on color.  However, this is an

The background pixel value is derived
from a resource of the Core widget.  (Core defines a background
resource but no foreground.)  On the other hand, the line_style
member of XGCValues is set to LineOnOffDash regardless of
resource settings.  In general, you hardcode the
GC components that you don't want to be user customizable.

than being hardcoded.  Colors and fonts are the most basic examples.
In the X Window System you can't use a color until you
allocate a pixel value for it, and you can't use a font until you
load it.  The code that processes resources called by
XtAppInitialize() automatically allocates and loads the colors and
fonts specified as resources, and sets the instance variables to the
right representation type as specified in the resource table.
Therefore, it is actually easier to provide user customizability than
to convert values to the representation types required to hardcode
them.

widget's window and for redrawing the window every time a part of the
ID="IX-1013-7-81"redrawing windows
window becomes exposed.  This redrawing is necessary because the X
server does not maintain the contents of windows when they are
obscured.  When a window becomes visible again, it must be redrawn.The expose method usually needs to modify its drawing
based on the geometry of the window and other instance variables set
in other methods.  For example, the Label widget will left-justify,
center, or right-justify its text according to the XmNalignment
resource, and the actual position to draw the text depends on the
widget's current size.  The Label widget has an instance structure field
called alignment, which is set initially in the
initialize method, and is read in Label's expose method.Another factor to consider when writing the expose method is that
many widgets also draw from action routines, in response to
user events.  For example, BitmapEdit
toggles bitmap cells in action routines.  The expose method
must be capable of redrawing the current state of the widget at any
time.  This means that action routines usually set instance
variables when they draw so that the expose method can read these
instance variables and draw the right thing.ID="IX-1013-7-82"displaylistsMost widgets keep track of what they draw in some form of arrays or
display lists.  When they need to redraw, they simply replay the saved
drawing commands in the original order to redraw the window.
For example, BitmapEdit keeps track of the state of each bitmap
cell in a character array.
It could easily traverse this array and
redraw each cell that is set in the array.ID="IX-1013-7-83"pixmapaboutHowever, BitmapEdit does not use this strategy.  In order to improve
its scrolling performance, the expose method copies
an off-screen pixmap into the window whenever redisplay is required.
The actions draw into this off-screen pixmap (in addition to updating
the character array), and then call the expose method
directly to have the correct portion of the pixmap copied to the window.
ID="IX-1013-7-84"bounding boxID="IX-1013-7-85"eventsmocking up from actionThe expose method is passed an event that contains the
bounding box of the area exposed.  To achieve maximum performance it
copies only this area from the pixmap to the window.  The BitmapEdit
actions take advantage of this, too.  They manufacture an artificial
event containing the bounding box of the cell to be toggled, and
pass it when they call expose.  This causes the expose
method to copy that one cell that was just updated to the window.

}ID="IX-1013-7-87"realizationID="IX-1013-7-88"XtIsRealizedNote that the expose method first checks to see that
the widget is realized using XtIsRealized().  This is a precaution
against the unlikely event that an instance of this widget is
suddenly destroyed or unrealized by an application while
Expose events are still pending.
If this did happen, drawing on the nonexistent window would cause
an X Protocol error.Next, BitmapEdit's expose method sets the rectangle it
will redraw based on the event passed in by Xt.
We also call this method directly from the action that processes
button presses.  That action routine creates a pseudo-event to pass to
expose to describe the area to be drawn.ID="IX-1013-7-89"exposeexposure; compressionID="IX-1013-7-90"Core widgetfields; compress_exposure
If the compress_exposure field of the class structure
is initialized to XtExposeCompressMultiple (or one of
a few other constants, described in Chapter 9, More Input Techniques), as it is in
BitmapEdit, Xt automatically merges the multiple Expose
events that may occur because of a single user action into one
Expose event.  In this case, the Expose event
contains the bounding box of the areas exposed.  BitmapEdit redraws
everything in this bounding box.  For widgets that are very
time-consuming to redraw, you might want to use the third
argument of the expose method, which is a region.
The Region type is opaquely defined by Xlib (internally a
linked list of rectangles).  The Region passed into
expose describes the union of all the areas exposed by a user
action.  You can use this region to clip output to the exposed region,
and possibly calculate which drawing primitives affect this area.
Xlib provides region mathematics routines (such as
XRectInRegion()) to compare the regions in which your widget
needs to draw with the region needing redrawing.  If certain areas do
not require redrawing, you can skip the code that redraws them,
thereby saving valuable time.  However, if this calculation is
complicated, its cost/benefit ratio should be examined.

Consider the arrangement of windows shown in 
LINKEND="FG-1013-07-1"Figure 7-1.Window 1 and Window 3 are other applications, and Widget 2 is an
application consisting solely of our widget.Initially, Window 3 is on top, Window 1 is behind it, and Widget 2 is
hidden completely behind Window 1.  When Window 1 is lowered, Widget 2
becomes visible, except where it is still overlapped by Window 3.  The
newly-exposed area can be described by two rectangles; A and B.  If
compress_exposure is False, Widget 2's expose method
will be called twice and passed an Expose event first describing
Rectangle A, then Rectangle B.  But if compress_exposure is
True,
Widget 2's expose method will be called just once, passed
an Expose event describing the bounding box of all the
original Expose events (which would be the entire widget in
this case), and passed a Region which is the union of the
rectangles described by all of the Expose events.  The region
argument of the expose method is unused unless
compress_exposure is True.

Each of these exposure-handling techniques may be the best for certain
widgets.  For a widget like BitmapEdit, any of the three methods will
work, but the bounding box method is the most efficient and convenient.
For a complete description of Expose event handling
ID="IX-1013-7-95"Xlib library
strategies, see Chapter 8, Events, in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.The remainder of BitmapEdit's expose method shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-07-3"Example 7-3 consists of a single Xlib call to copy
from a pixmap into the widget's window.  As described in
Chapter 4, An Example Application,
BitmapEdit makes a large pixmap that is
one plane deep and draws theID="FG-1013-07-1"compress_exposure: 2 rectangles if XtExposeNoCompress; bounding box and region if XtExposeCompressSeries or XtExposeCompressMultipleFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="07.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-7-1"current bitmap into it.  When needed in
the expose method, this pixmap just has to be copied into the
window.  This approach was chosen for its simplicity.  When
scrollbars are added,
the widget is able to pan around in the large bitmap quickly and
efficiently.  Note that one of two Xlib routines is called based on the
depth of the screen.  This is because XCopyArea() is slightly
more efficient than XCopyPlane() and should be used
when running on a monochrome screen.

}ID="IX-1013-7-108"set_values methodexample from BitmapEditThe set_values method is called with three copies of the
widget's instance structure as arguments:  current,
request, and new.  The current copy includes
the current settings of the instance variables, and request
includes the settings made through XtVaSetValues() but
not yet changed by the superclasses' set_values methods.
The new copy is the same as request except that it has
already been processed by the set_values methods of
all superclasses.ID="IX-1013-7-109"resourcesand set_values methodID="IX-1013-7-110"methodsresources and set_values
For each public variable, set_values compares the current
value and the new value, and if they are different, validates the
new value or changes any private values that
depend on it.  The new copy is the only one that the
method changes;
request and current are only for reference.
As in the initialize method, you have to
deal only with the instance variables for your subclass, and perhaps
with width
and height, because the set_values method is downward
chained.  Superclass set_values methods take care of setting
all the superclass instance fields.  However, if desired, you can
change superclass fields in your method since it is called last.
ID="IX-1013-7-111"superclass
For example, this might be useful if your class has different
criteria for determining valid values or dependencies.The request copy of the instance variables is used
only if your class needs to decide between a superclass setting and
your widget's setting; disagreements about this usually occur
over the size of the widget.
For more information on when to use request, see the
reference page for set_values in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual.

It is also important to notice that the set_values method,
if it exists at all (that is, if it is not specified as NULL in the
class structure), must return True or False to indicate
whether the changes made to the state variables require the widget to
be redrawn.  If it is True for this class or any superclass,
Xt calls the Xlib routine XClearArea() with the
exposures argument set to True (to force the
background of the widget to be redrawn, which normally occurs only
after Expose events), and then Xt calls the
expose method.  In other words, you should make
set_values return True whenever the changes to the
instance variables will change what is drawn in the widget.
ID="IX-1013-7-116"resourcesand set_values methodID="IX-1013-7-117"methodsresources and set_valuesNote, however, that set_values should not return
True if width and height change, because the
X server automatically generates Expose events for a window
when it is resized.  If you do return True in this case, your
expose method will be called twice.ID="IX-1013-7-118"widgetsrealizingSince the application may call XtVaSetValues() before the widget
is realized, it is important not to assume in the set_values
method that the widget has a window.  In other words, the code must
use XtIsRealized() to check whether the widget is realized before
using the XtWindow() macro, such as in a call to set window
attributes.
ID="IX-1013-7-119"realizationID="IX-1013-7-120"XtWindowID="IX-1013-7-121"graphics contextschangingAs mentioned earlier, some of the private variables are usually
GCs.  Whenever the public variable for a color or font is changed
through XtVaSetValues(), a GC also has to be changed.  This is an
example of a private variable depending on a public one.
GCs allocated with XtGetGC() should not be changed since they may
be shared by other widgets.  Therefore, the normal response to
a change in one of the resources on which a GC depends is to release the GC
with XtReleaseGC() and request a new one with XtGetGC().
ID="IX-1013-7-122"graphics contextsfreeingID="IX-1013-7-123"XtReleaseGCID="IX-1013-7-124"XtGetGCIf some of your widget's GCs are unlikely to be shared by other
widget instances in an application (either because each instance will
use different values for the GC components or there will be only one
instance), and the widget needs to be able
to make changes to them, and the changes are not predictable enough
or few enough to reasonably create a GC for each variation, then the
XtGetGC()/XtReleaseGC()
approach is not ideal.  What happens in this situation is that
XtGetGC() creates a new GC and XtReleaseGC() frees the
old GC every time a change is made, even if the changes are small.
It is more efficient in this situation to change the affected values
in the existing GC.  But this can be done only with an Xlib
routine--there is no Toolkit routine for changing a GC.  To
implement this approach, you create, modify, and free the unusual GC
using Xlib routines only.  You call XCreateGC() in the
initialize method to create the GC, XChangeGC() in the
set_values method to change the GC, and XFreeGC() in
ID="IX-1013-7-125"Xlib library
the destroy method to free the GC.  All of these Xlib routines
are described in Chapter 5, The Graphics Context, in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.
ID="IX-1013-7-126"graphics contextschangingXtGetGC() always creates a GC that can only be used on
drawables (windows and pixmaps) of the default depth of the screen.
Drawing into a pixmap of depth one using a GC created with
XtGetGC() works on a monochrome display, but does not
work on a color display.  (The depth is the number of bits per pixel
used to represent colors on the screen.)
This is another situation in which you will need to call
XCreateGC() instead of XtGetGC().ID="IX-1013-7-127"resourcesand set_values methodID="IX-1013-7-128"methodsresources and set_values
Note also that
BitmapEdit does not allow two of its resources to be changed by
XtVaSetValues(); they can be set only until the widget is created.
To disallow changes to a resource, the set_values method
must actively set the value in the new widget (newcw) to the
value in the current widget (curcw), wiping out the setting
made through XtVaSetValues().  It is also advisable that the
widget print a message describing
that the resource cannot be set through XtVaSetValues().The XtWarning() call used in the example is simply an alternative
to calling fprintf, that helps to make all error messages
uniform, and is described in
Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques.
The code in the set_values_hook method, 
described in Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion, can optionally 
be placed in the set_values method.

that will manage its geometry.
Depending on the layout policy of this parent widget in the application,
the widget's window may change size when the application is resized.LINKEND="FN-1013-7-4"ID="IX-1013-7-135" SPAN="START"widgetsresizingID="IX-1013-7-136"geometry managementaboutID="IX-1013-7-137"rubber-band outlineID="FN-1013-7-4"Also note that the application may be resized when it is first mapped
on the screen, when the user sizes the rubber-band outline of the
application provided by most window managers.  (You may not think
of this as resizing, but it is.)  When this happens, the
application has already created its widgets and the widgets have
created windows.  Therefore, the resize method of a widget
will be called if its parent widget is forced to resize it.
Most widgets need to recalculate the position and size of their
graphics when their window changes size.  This is the job of the
resize method.
ID="IX-1013-7-138"resizingresize methodThe resize method is passed only one argument, the widget
instance structure pointer (of type Widget).  This structure
contains the new position, size, and border width of the widget's
window.  The method changes any instance part fields that depend on
the size or position of the widget.  When the resize
method returns, Xt calls the expose method, regardless of
whether or not the contents need redrawing.  (It is a basic
characteristic of the X server that it generates Expose
events when a window is resized.)A Label widget whose text is centered would
ID="IX-1013-7-139"Label widgetID="IX-1013-7-140"BitmapEdit widget
reset the starting position of its text in the resize method.In some widgets, it takes some thought to determine the correct
response to resizing.  Take BitmapEdit, for example.  BitmapEdit
can be configured to show only a portion of the bitmap, so
that scrollbars can pan around in the complete bitmap.  When
the application is resized, should BitmapEdit show more cells or
increase the cell size?  Up to the point where the entire
bitmap is shown, it is easier to increase the number of cells
shown.  When BitmapEdit is resized larger than necessary to show
the entire bitmap, it should probably increase the cell size.
We will use this strategy in the resize method of the BitmapEdit
widget, which is shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-07-5"Example 7-5.LINKEND="FN-1013-7-5"ID="FN-1013-7-5"This resize strategy does have one
problem; it never reduces the cell size.  This is not a serious
problem because BitmapEdit has a resource that controls the cell size.

}ID="IX-1013-7-141"resizingresize method; example from BitmapEditBecause of the two-phase resize strategy used by BitmapEdit, and
because BitmapEdit uses a pixmap in its repaint strategy, this
resize method is more complicated than most.  When the
widget is resized larger that necessary to show the entire bitmap in
the current cell_size, it destroys the current pixmap and creates a
new one.  Since this should not happen
very often and because resizing does not require extremely fast
response, the time it takes to recreate the pixmap and draw into it
is acceptable.
ID="IX-1013-7-142"optimizationOne difficulty in writing the resize method is that you
do not have access to the old size or position of the window.
The widget instance structure passed in has already been updated with
the current size and position.  If you need the old information,
you can cache the old size in an instance part field, set first in
the initialize method, and again at the end of
the resize method.
ID="IX-1013-7-143"cachingold sizeID="IX-1013-7-144"resizingcaching old sizeIt is also important to note that the resize method is not
allowed to request that the parent resize the widget again to get
a better size.  (How to suggest properly to the parent that your
widget be resized is described in Chapter 12, Geometry Management.)

will be a composite or constraint widget that manages
its size and position.  Parent widgets need to know the preferred
size of a widget so they can make good decisions about the size of each
child.  The query_geometry method is called when the parent
is about to make a size change to some of its children but is not
yet sure which ones and by how much.
(How geometry management works is described
in Chapter 12, Geometry Management.  For now, we are concentrating
on what you need to do to write a simple widget.)If your widget specifies NULL in the
class structure for the query_geometry method, the parent
will be told that your widget's current geometry is its preferred
geometry.  This is often wrong information.  For example, if your
widget has already been resized to be one-pixel-by-one-pixel because
the user has resized an application to be very small, the parent would
receive the message that your widget prefers to be that small.
When the application is resized to be larger again, the parent will have
no information on which to base its resizing decisions.
Even if your widget has no particular preference for size, it is
a good idea to specify the widget's default size in
query_geometry.  Then, at least, the parent has a ballpark figure
for typical sizes for your widget.  The parent could at least find
out that BitmapEdit is intended to be larger than a Label widget.

raised before showing an example: the method's return value.

and it is the returned type of query_geometry.

query_geometry returns XtGeometryNo.  This symbol
is slightly misleading--think of it as XtGeometryNoChange (a symbol that

Any server resources created by Xt (such as GCs requested through
XtGetGC()) should be freed in the destroy method.
In addition, if you called any Xlib routines, such as
XCreateGC(), that allocate server- or client-side resources,
be sure to free
them here.  BitmapEdit creates pixmaps for use in the drawing
process, so it must free them.  It must also free the GCs it
allocated.

ID="IX-1013-7-195"actionswidget instance pointerAn action routine in widget code can set and read fields in the
widget instance structure passed in, while an action added from
the application can access its own application data structure but
not the widget's internal data structure because of the encapsulation
rule (see LINKEND="S3-1013-2-4"Section 2.1.6.4, "Encapsulation").  This is one of the advantages of moving
this code into a widget.You should now be ready to go back near the end of Chapter 6, Inside
a Widget, and follow the directions to write your first widget.
You will need to review parts of both Chapter 6 and this chapter as
the process of actually writing a widget raises new questions in your mind.ID="CH-1013-8-1" NUMBER="8"Events, Translations, and AcceleratorsEvents, Translations, and AcceleratorsThis chapter describes the complete syntax of translation tables,
and describes a mechanism called accelerators for mapping events in
one widget to actions in another.  Motif mnemonics, which are
keyboard shortcuts for invoking menu items in visible menus,
are also discussed.Events drive the application.  They send a great variety of
information from the server to the client and from the user to the
application.  More knowledge of events is necessary both to
use existing widgets successfully in large applications and to
write widgets.Events are sufficiently central to X that we've devoted two
chapters in this book to them.  This chapter provides a closer
look at translations and actions; Chapter 9, More Input Techniques, looks at lower-level
event handlers, as well as at other sources of input.
Appendix C, Event Reference, in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, will also be useful when you need details
about any of the event types.The basic concept and use of translations and actions has
already been described.  But translation tables have a complicated
syntax which can be used to do much more than the simple mappings you
have seen until now.  Translation tables can detect user-interface
idioms such as double- and triple-button clicks or key combinations
such as Shift-Meta-M.  This chapter focuses on the more
advanced features of translation tables.ID="IX-1013-8-1"acceleratorsaboutNext, we discuss a variation of translations called
accelerators.  Accelerators bind events that
occur in one widget to actions in another.  This is a flexible feature
with many uses.  One common use is to supply a keyboard interface to
a normally pointer-driven application.  By adding accelerators to
the top-level window of the application, a keyboard event typed with
the pointer anywhere in the application can be translated into an
action in the correct widget.  The name "accelerator" comes from the
fact that many advanced users find it faster to use keyboard
shortcuts instead of menus.
ID="IX-1013-8-2"keyboardkeyboard shortcutsacceleratorsBoth translations and accelerators are resources.  Therefore
they are normally set by default in the widget code, but can
be replaced or overridden by user-defined settings in resource files
or with xrdb.  In R5, a new "psuedo-resource" called
XtNbaseTranslations provides a new level of flexibility
in modifying translations from resource files.
Be sure to see LINKEND="S2-1013-10-12"Section 10.2.12, "The XtNbaseTranslations Resource" for an explanation of how
translation resources should be set.
As mentioned in Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets,
it is a very good idea to specify translation tables and
accelerator tables in the app-defaults file instead
of hardcoding them in the application,
especially while an application is under development.
This lets you develop the translations and accelerators without
recompiling the application every time you want to make a change.ID="S1-1013-8-1"Translation Table SyntaxID="IX-1013-8-3"translationssyntaxIf you are reading this book in sequence, you've already seen
translations used many times.    However, we haven't given a
formal description of their syntax or a complete listing of the
events you can translate.A translation table consists of an optional directive, which specifies how the
table should be merged with any other existing translation
tables, followed by a series of production rules, of
the form:ID="SC-1013-8-1"[modifier_list]<event>[,<event>...][(count)][detail]: action([arguments])[ action...]where brackets ([ ]) indicate optional elements, an ellipsis (...) indicates
repetition, and italics indicate substitution of an actual
modifier, event, detail, or action name.At a minimum, a translation must specify at least one event,
specified by a predefined event name or abbreviation enclosed in
angle brackets; a colon separator; and
at least one action.  However, a sequence of events can be
specified; likewise, more than one action can be invoked as a result.
The scope of event matching can
be limited by one or more optional modifiers, and, in the case of
some events, by a "detail" field that specifies additional
information about the event.  (For example, for key events the
detail field specifies which key has been pressed.)  Repeated
occurrences of the same event (e.g., a double-click) can be
specified by a count value in parentheses.
A colon and optional white space separates
the translation and the action.
ID="IX-1013-8-4"translationssyntaxThe examples below are all valid translations:ID="SC-1013-8-2"<Enter>:  doit()                    invoke doit() on an EnterWindow event<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:  doit()        invoke doit() on a click of Button 1<Btn1Up>(2):  doit()                invoke doit() on a double-click of Button 1Button1<Btn2Down>,<Btn2Up>:  doit()     invoke doit() on a click of Button 2 while Button 1 is held downShift<BtnDown>:  doit()    invoke doit() on a click of any button while the shift key is held down<Key>y:  doit()                     invoke doit() when the y key is pressedID="IX-1013-8-5"translationsnewlines inID="IX-1013-8-6"newlinesin translationsA translation table is a single string, even when composed of multiple
translations.  If a translation table consists of more than one
translation, the actual newlines are escaped with a backslash
(except for the last one), and character newlines
are inserted with the \n escape sequence, as you've
seen demonstrated in examples throughout this book.The following sections provide additional detail on each of the
elements of an event translation.  We'll talk first about the
directive, followed by event specifiers, details, modifiers, and counts.
We'll also provide some pointers on the proper sequence of
translations, and discuss what happens when translations
overlap.ID="S2-1013-8-1"The DirectiveID="IX-1013-8-7"translationsdifferences between directivesAs we've already seen, the three possible directives are
#replace, #override, or #augment.#replace says to completely replace the value of the
translations resource in the widget.
If no directive is specified, #replace is the
default.The difference
between #override and #augment is more subtle.
They differ in how they treat event combinations in the new translation
that also appear in the old.  With #override, the new
translation takes priority, while with #augment, the old one does.For example, say a widget has a default translation table that includes
a translation for the Return key, and an application that uses this
widget has an app-defaults file consisting of a translation
table that applies to this widget.  If the translation table in
the app-defaults file began with #override, any translation
for the Return key would take priority over the default translation
for the Return key.
On the other hand, if the translation table in the app-defaults file began with #augment, the default translations would
take priority.Remember that the difference between #augment and
#override is only in the treatment of overlapping translations.  Any
translations added with either directive for events that do not
already appear in the
existing translation table will always be added.Because of potential overlap between translations, when you are
debugging your intended translations it is best to use
#replace at first, then test with #augment or
#override as appropriate once you are sure that the
translations themselves have the desired effect.ID="S2-1013-8-2"Selecting the Events to TranslateID="IX-1013-8-8"eventsaboutAn X event is a packet of data sent by the server to a client in
response to user behavior or to window system changes resulting
from interactions between windows.
There are 33 different types of events defined by X.  
Most (though not allLINKEND="FN-1013-8-1") 
ID="FN-1013-8-1"Others reflect internal changes in the window system not related
to any window.  For example, a mapping Notify event occurs in
response to a change in the mappings of keysyms (portable key symbols)
to keycodes (actual codes generated by physical keys).
events can be thought of as occurring in a window:
the pointer entering or leaving a window, pointer motion within a
window, pointer button presses, key presses, and so on.
However, most events are not sent to a window unless the window
has explicitly selected that event type; events are selected
on a per-window basis.
In Xlib programming, events are selected by specifying an
event mask as a window attribute.  Some events, which are sent to all
windows regardless of whether a window has selected them or not,
are called non-maskable events.  One of the most complex
aspects of Xlib programming is designing the event loop, which
must take into account all of the possible events that can occur
in a window.
ID="IX-1013-8-9"eventsnonmaskableID="IX-1013-8-10"eventsnonmaskable; example of handlersXt's translation manager selects the events that are specified in
the current translation table for each widget.
In translations, events can be specified either by their actual names,
as shown in Column 1 of
LINKEND="TB-1013-8-1"Table 8-1, or by means of the abbreviations shown in Column 2.
A complete reference to each event type
is provided in Appendix C, Event Reference, in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual.

handled automatically by the Toolkit
separately from the translation mechanism.  For example, Expose
events are automatically sent to the expose method of the
appropriate widget.  When there is also a translation for
Expose events, the action is called in addition to the
expose method.  The only reason you would need a translation
for Expose events is to add drawing to a Core widget.
Because the Core widget doesn't have an expose method, there
ID="IX-1013-8-15"Core widget
is rarely, if ever, a case where there is both an expose method
and a translation for Expose events for the same widget.
The point to remember is that any event can be specified in a

Xt.ID="IX-1013-8-16"eventsGraphicsExposeID="IX-1013-8-17"eventsNoExposeID="IX-1013-8-18"eventsGraphicsExposeID="IX-1013-8-19"nonfatal errorerror handlingGraphicsExpose and NoExpose events are useful when
your application copies from a visible window with XCopyArea() or
XCopyPlane().  They notify the application when part of the
source of the copy is obscured.  If you want
GraphicsExpose and NoExpose events,
you must explicitly select them by setting the
graphics_exposures GC component in the GC used for the copy.
Then you can provide a translation for them, or if you are writing
a widget you can have them sent to your expose method
by setting the
compress_exposure field of the Core structure
to a special value, as described in LINKEND="S2-1013-9-9"Section 9.7.2, "Event Filters."ID="IX-1013-8-20"XCopyArea Xlib functionID="IX-1013-8-21"XCopyPlane Xlib function

the *Request events are intended for use only by window

Chapter 11, Interclient Communications.The keyboard traversal code built into the Motif Primitive
class handles EnterNotify, LeaveNotify,
FocusIn, and FocusOut events.Whether or not they are already handled by Xt or in translations,
events can also be selected explicitly by
installing event handlers in a widget (as described in Chapter 9, More Input Techniques).ID="S2-1013-8-3"Details in Keyboard EventsID="IX-1013-8-27" SPAN="START"translationsdetails inID="IX-1013-8-28" SPAN="START"translationskeyboard eventsID="IX-1013-8-29"details in translationstranslationsAs you've seen, Xt provides special event abbreviations to specify
which pointer button was pressed or released.  With key events,
this approach would be a little impractical, since there are so
many keys.  Instead, the Translation Manager
allows you to follow the event specification with an optional
detail field.  That is:ID="SC-1013-8-3"<Key>:  doit()means that you want the doit() action to be invoked when any key has
been pressed, while:ID="SC-1013-8-4"<Key>y:  doit()means that you want the doit() action to be invoked only if the
y key has been pressed.
ID="IX-1013-8-30"key eventsevents or translationsID="IX-1013-8-31"pointereventsevents or translationsWhat you actually specify as the detail field of a Key event is a
keysym, as defined in the header file <X11/keysymdef.h>.LINKEND="FN-1013-8-2"ID="FN-1013-8-2"Note, however, that
this file includes foreign language keysym sets that are not always
available.  Only the MISCELLANY, LATIN1 through LATIN4, and GREEK sets are
always available.
Keysyms begin with an XK_ prefix,
which is omitted when they are used in translations.Before we explain any further, we need to review X's keyboard model,
which, like many things in X, is complicated by the design goal of
allowing applications to run equally well on
machines with very different hardware.ID="IX-1013-8-32"eventsKeyReleaseThe keyboard generates KeyPress events, and may or may
not also generate
KeyRelease events.  These events contain a server-dependent
code that describes the key pressed, called a keycode.
ID="IX-1013-8-33"keycodesaboutModifier keys, such as Shift and Control, generate events just
like every other key.  In addition, all key events also
contain information about which modifier keys and pointer buttons
were held down at the time the event occurred.ID="IX-1013-8-34"keysymsaboutXt provides a routine that translates keycode and modifier key
information from an event into a portable symbolic constant called a
keysym.  A keysym represents the meaning of the key pressed,
which is usually the symbol that appears on the cap of the key.
For example, when the a key is pressed, the keysym is XK_a;
when the same key is pressed while the Shift key is held
down, the resulting keysym is XK_A (uppercase).
Note that even though both the a and the A events have the same
keycode, they generate a different keysym because they occurred
with
different modifier keys engaged.  (The mapping between keycodes and
keysyms is discussed further in LINKEND="S1-1013-14-5"Section 14.5, "Keyboard Interpretation.")You may specify either the keysym name, omitting the XK_ prefix,
or its hexadecimal value
(also shown in <X11/keysymdef.h>), prefixed by
0x or 0X (zero followed by x or X).
ID="IX-1013-8-35"keysymskeysymdef.h header fileThis is fairly straightforward, though there are several
provisos:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-8-36"conventionskeysym namingID="IX-1013-8-37"keysymsnaming conventionsID="IX-1013-8-38"conventionskeysym naming
The keysym for nonalphanumeric
keyboard keys may not always be obvious; you will need to look
in <X11/keysymdef.h>.    For example, the
keyboard for the Sun workstation has keys labeled "Left" and
"Right."  Their keysyms are XK_Meta_L and XK_Meta_R,
respectively.  Fortunately, most common named keys have mnemonic
keysym names (XK_Return,
XK_Linefeed,
XK_BackSpace,
XK_Tab,
XK_Delete,
and so on) so you can often get by without looking them up.
Notice, though, the small things that can trip you up:  BackSpace,
not Backspace, but Linefeed, not LineFeed.  You can't count on
consistency.The definitions in
<X11/keysymdef.h> spell out keysym names for
punctuation and other special characters.  For example, you'll
see XK_question rather than XK_?, and so on.
Nonetheless, you need
not use this long keysym name; the Translation Manager will
accept the equivalent single character, as long as it is a
printing character.  This is also true of digits.
There are a few exceptions, namely the characters that have
special meaning in a translation table.  If you ever need
a translation for colon, comma,
angle brackets, or backslash, you'll have to use the keysym name
rather than the single printing character.The keycode-to-keysym translator built into the Translation
Manager makes case distinctions only if the key event is prefaced
with the colon (:) modifier.  This means that
<Key>a and <Key>A will be treated identically
by default.  We'll return to this
subject when we discuss modifiers.In sum, the following are all valid key event translations:ID="SC-1013-8-5"<Key>q:  quit()               invoke quit() when q or Q is pressed
:<Key>?:  help()              invoke help() when ? (but not /) is pressed

also available for several other event types.  They simplify your
action function because they instruct Xt to call the action
only when the event contains the matching detail.  One type of
detail, for MotionNotify, actually affects the selection
of events.Trivially, the detail values Button1 through
Button5 can be supplied as details for ButtonPress

generated when the pointer enters or leaves a window, and
FocusIn and FocusOut events are generated when a
click-to-type window manager changes the keyboard focus window--the
window that receives all keyboard input regardless of pointer position.
In these cases the detail is
Normal.
But these events are also generated
when the keyboard or pointer is grabbed by an application with a
call to XtGrabPointer(), XtGrabButton(),
XtGrabKeyboard(), or XtGrabKey().
A grab, which is usually invoked by a popup window,
also causes keyboard and/or
pointer input to be constrained to a particular window.
When these events are generated because of a grab or the release of
a grab, the detail is Grab or Ungrab.

For MotionNotify events you can now select
normal motion events or motion
hints by specifying a detail of Normal or Hint.
Normal motion events are used when you need a complete
record of the path of the pointer.  The compress_motion Core
field, described in Chapter 9, is for use with normal motion events.
Motion hints are used when you need only periodic pointer position
updates.  Each time you receive a motion hint you call
XQueryPointer() (an Xlib call) to get the current pointer
position.  Note that the MotionNotify detail is the only one
that affects event selection.For PropertyNotify, SelectionClear,
SelectionRequest, SelectionNotify,

xev client, which prints detailed information
about every event happening in its window.
To find out a keysym, run xev, move the pointer into its
window, and then press the key in question.On the Sun SparcStation, there is only one control key,
on the left side of the keyboard.  It generates the keysym
XK_Control_L.  There are two shift keys, one
on each side, which generate the keysyms
XK_Shift_L and
XK_Shift_R.  The Meta modifier is mapped to the
keys labeled "Left" and "Right."    Even though there is an Alternate
keyboard key, which generates the keysym XK_Alt_R, this key is
not recognized as a modifier.  There are no Super and Hyper
keys.The list of valid modifiers can be displayed with the
xmodmap client, as follows:

Shift modifier, the Caps Lock key as the Lock modifier,
and either the Left or Right keys as the Meta

modifier.  The Alt key is not recognized as a modifier.ID="IX-1013-8-86"modifiersaddingxmodmap also allows you to add keysyms to be recognized as

xmodmap and xev, see Chapter 11 of Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide, Motif Edition.ID="S3-1013-8-2"Default Interpretation of the Modifier ListIf no modifiers are specified in a translation,
the state of the modifier keys and pointer buttons
makes no difference to a translation.  For example, the
translation:ID="SC-1013-8-11"<Key>q:    quit()will cause the quit action to be invoked when the q
key is pressed, regardless of whether the Shift, Ctrl, Meta, or
Lock key is also held, and regardless of the state of the pointer
buttons.Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is nothing to
prohibit other modifiers from being present as well.  For
example, the translation:ID="SC-1013-8-12"Shift<Key>q:    quit()will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key (and the q key).There are a number of special modifier symbols that can
be used to change this forgiving state of affairs.  These symbols
are shown in

when button 1 is being held down, while:ID="SC-1013-8-14"~Button1<Key>:  doit()says that doit() should be invoked by a press of any key
except when button 1 is being held down.A ~ applies only to
the modifier that immediately follows it.  For example:ID="SC-1013-8-15"~Shift Ctrl<Key>:  doit()says that doit() should be invoked when Ctrl is held down in
conjunction with any key, except if Shift is depressed at the

list and affects the entire list.  This one is really in a
category by itself, since it applies only to Key events.Normally, the translations:ID="SC-1013-8-19"<Key>a:  doit()and:ID="SC-1013-8-20"<Key>A:  doit()have identical results:  both will match either a lowercase or an
uppercase A.    Preceding the translation with a colon makes the case of the
keysym significant.  For example, to create commands like vi editor, you might specify the following translations:ID="SC-1013-8-21":<Key>a:  append()  \n\
:<Key>A:  appendToEndOfLine()In this case, a and A are distinct.  You could achieve somewhat the same
result by specifying:ID="SC-1013-8-22"~Shift<Key>a:  append()  \n\
Shift<Key>a:  appendToEndOfLine()However, this second example is both more complex and less effective.
While the colon syntax will match an uppercase character
generated as a result of either the Shift or Lock modifiers, the
example shown immediately above will handle only Shift.  You could use the
following translation to prohibit both Shift and Lock from being
asserted, but there is no way to specify that either Shift or
Lock may be present:ID="SC-1013-8-23"~Shift ~Lock<Key>a:  append()  \n\
Shift<Key>a:  appendToEndOfLine()Note that you cannot specify both the Shift or Lock modifier and
an uppercase keysym.  For example:ID="SC-1013-8-24"Shift<Key>A:  doit()will have no effect, since you cannot further shift an uppercase
character.  The sequence !: at the beginning of a translation
means that the listed modifiers must be in the correct state
and that no other modifiers except the Shift and Lock keys may
be asserted.  In other words, !:  by itself means the
translation is triggered only if the specified key is pressed,
considering case, and no other modifier is pressed.For more details on how the Toolkit handles the ins and outs of
case conversion, see Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques.  A more rigorous discussion of how the
colon modifier works is also given in Appendix F, Translation Table Syntax, in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual.

sequence of events that must occur for the action to be invoked.  For
example, we might want a certain action to be invoked only if the
first button is clicked twice in succession.Each event specified in the sequence is one of the
abbreviations for an event type enclosed in angle brackets,
optionally led by any set of modifiers and special characters, as
described in LINKEND="S2-1013-8-5"Section 8.1.5, "Modifiers."  Each modifier-list/event pair
in the sequence is separated by a comma.For example, the translation to perform an action in response to
a button press followed by a release of the same button (a button
click) is the following:ID="SC-1013-8-25"<BtnDown>,<BtnUp> : doit()ID="IX-1013-8-111"double clicksID="IX-1013-8-112"translationsdouble-clicksButton press events may be specified in the translation table followed
by a count in parentheses to distinguish a multiple click.
The
translation to detect a double click is:ID="SC-1013-8-26"<Btn1Down>(2) : doit()or:ID="SC-1013-8-27"<Btn1Up>(2) : doit()Notice that though they have the same effect for the user, these
two translations are actually interpreted differently.  The first
is equivalent to saying:ID="SC-1013-8-28"<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>,<Btn1Down>:  doit()while the second is equivalent to:ID="SC-1013-8-29"<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>,<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:  doit()A plus (+) may appear immediately after the count inside the
parentheses to indicate that any number of clicks greater than the
specified count should trigger the action.The following translation detects two or more clicks:ID="SC-1013-8-30"<Btn1Down>(2+) : doit()The maximum count that can be specified is 9.Xt uses a timing technique to detect whether two or more clicks should
be considered a multi-click or separate single clicks.
The time is controlled by the XmNmultiClickTimeID="IX-1013-8-113"XmNmultiClickTime resourceID="IX-1013-8-114"double clicksID="IX-1013-8-115"timingmultiple clicksID="IX-1013-8-116"multipleclick timingID="IX-1013-8-117"defaultmultiple click timing
application resource, which defaults to 200 milliseconds.
If 200 milliseconds or more of idle time passes between
clicks, Xt does not consider that a match.  You can set this resource
to different values for each display using XtSetMultiClickTime().For key events, you need to be careful when you want to make
a particular key sequence invoke one action, and a subset of
that key sequence to invoke another.  For example, consider
the following translation:ID="SC-1013-8-31" <Key>a,<Key>b : something()
 <Key>         : else()One might expect <Key>b events not preceded by
<Key>a events to invoke the else() action.
But instead, such <Key>b events are discarded.
To get what you expected, use:ID="SC-1013-8-32" <Key>a,<Key>b : something()
 <Key>b        : else()
 <Key>         : else()ID="S3-1013-8-6"Special Considerations Involving Motion EventsID="IX-1013-8-118"eventsMotionNotifyID="IX-1013-8-119"translationsMotion eventsBeware of interaction between pointer motion events and double
clicking translations in the same table.
If no motion events are specified in a translation table, these
events are never selected, so there is no problem
if they occur between other events.  This
allows a double click to be detected even if the user
inadvertently jiggled the pointer in the course of the click.
However, if motion events are selected for anywhere in the table,
they may interfere with the expansion of events specified with
the repeat notation.
The suggested way to handle both motion events and double clicks
in the same translation table is to have all clicks sent to
one action procedure, then use the timestamps in the events to
implement your own algorithm for differentiating single clicks
from double clicks.  For example:ID="SC-1013-8-33"<Btn1Down>:  handleClicks()
Button1<Motion>: handleMotif()The handleClicks action would handle both single and
double clicks.  As described in Section 8.1.7.3, this type of
implementation also is useful when you want different semantics
for single and double clicks.Multiple motion events will match any single motion
selected event in the translation.  That is:ID="SC-1013-8-34"<Motion>:  doit()will cause doit() to be invoked many times, once for each motion
event generated by the pointer movement, unless the
compress_motion event filter is turned on in the Core
class structure.  (This filter is described in Section
9.7.2.)ID="S3-1013-8-7"Modifiers and Event SequencesID="IX-1013-8-120"translationsmodifiers; and event sequencesID="IX-1013-8-121"modifiersand event sequencesA modifier list at the start of an event sequence applies to all

That is:ID="SC-1013-8-35"Shift<BtnDown>,<BtnUp>:  doit()is equivalent to:ID="SC-1013-8-36"Shift<BtnDown>,Shift<BtnUp>:  doit()However, if modifiers and events are
interspersed, the modifier applies only to the event immediately
following.  As an extreme case to demonstrate this behavior,
consider the following translation:ID="SC-1013-8-37"Ctrl<Btn2Down>,~Ctrl<Btn2Up>: doit()which requires that the Ctrl key be depressed when pointer button
2 is pressed; however, the key must not be depressed when the button is
released.ID="S3-1013-8-8"Using Modifiers to Specify Button Event SequencesID="IX-1013-8-122"modifiersfor button eventsRemember that there are modifiers for specifying the state of
pointer buttons as well as modifier keys.  These modifiers provide another
way of expressing some event sequences.
For example,
the following translation would invoke the action when the F1 key
is pressed while button 1 is being held down:ID="SC-1013-8-38"Button1<Key>F1:     doit()This is equivalent to:ID="SC-1013-8-39"<Btn1Down>,<Key>F1:  doit()The following translations could be used to
call an action when both the first and second pointer buttons are down,
regardless of the order in which they are pressed.ID="SC-1013-8-40"!Button1<Button2>:    doC() \n\
!Button2<Button1>:    doC()ID="S3-1013-8-9"Key Event SequencesThe Translation Manager specification provides a special
syntax for specifying a sequence of Key events--as a string.
That is:ID="SC-1013-8-41""yes":  doit()is theoretically equivalent to:ID="SC-1013-8-42"<Key>y,<Key>e,<Key>s:  doit()We say "theoretically" because, at least in R4 and R5 sample
implementations from MIT, the "yes" syntax does not work from
resource files.  It may or may not work in other implementations.Within a sequence of key events expressed as a string (on systems where
the "yes" syntax does work, if any), the special character ^
(circumflex) means
Ctrl and $ means Meta.  These two special characters, as well as
double quotes and backslashes, must be escaped with a backslash if
they are to appear literally in one of these strings.
ID="IX-1013-8-123" SPAN="END"translationsevent sequencesID="S2-1013-8-7"Interactions Between TranslationsID="IX-1013-8-124" SPAN="START"translationsinteractions betweenOne of the most difficult things to learn about translations is
how to predict the interactions between overlapping translations.ID="S3-1013-8-10"Translations in Multiple Resource FilesMuch more will be said about resource files and resource matching in
Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion.  However, it is important to make one point here.If several resource
files contain translation tables for the same widget,
only the one that takes priority according to file precedence and
resource matching will have any effect even if all of them
specify #augment or #override.
This is because the translation table
is the value of the resource, and only one resource value will
override all other values.In other words, even if all the translation tables specify
#augment or #override, a maximum of two translation
tables are merged by Xt: the widget's default translation table and
the one translation table that takes priority as determined by
the process of reading
and merging all the resource files (and the command line) and
then the process of resource matching.
If you call XtOverrideTranslations() or
XtAugmentTranslations() in the application, this is a third level
of merging, but it is unrelated to the resource files.ID="S3-1013-8-11"Order of TranslationsID="IX-1013-8-125" SPAN="START"translationsorderThe order of translations in a table is important, because
the table is searched from the top when each event arrives, and the
first match is taken.  Therefore, more
specific events must appear before more general ones.
Otherwise, the more specific ones will never be reached.For example, consider a text entry widget that wants to close
itself and dispatch a callback once the user presses the Return
key, indicating that entry is complete.
The widget's translations
might be:ID="SC-1013-8-43"<Key>Return:  gotData()    \n\
<Key>:        insertChar()If the translations were specified in the reverse order:ID="SC-1013-8-44"<Key>:        insertChar()  \n\
<Key>Return:  gotData()insertChar() would be called in response to a press of the
Return key, and gotData() would never be called.ID="IX-1013-8-126"translationsmergingKeeping track of translation order is made more complicated
when translations are merged.  For example, if one of the
above lines is in the default translations of a widget class, and the
other is in a translation table in a resource file,
in what order are the resulting translations?
Though not documented in the Xt specification, it
appears that the MIT implementation of Xt places the more specific
translation first.
ID="IX-1013-8-127" SPAN="END"translationsorderID="S3-1013-8-12"Event Sequences Sharing Initial EventsID="IX-1013-8-128" SPAN="START"eventsevent sequencesAn exception to this rule of more specific translations being
placed earlier in the translation table occurs with event
sequences.
One translation can contain an event or event sequence that appears
in another translation.  If the leading event or event sequence is in
common, both will operate correctly.  For example, the translations:ID="SC-1013-8-45"<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:    actionB() \n\
<Btn1Down>:             actionA()execute actionA() when button 1 is pressed and actionB() when
it is then released.  This is true regardless of which translation
appears first in the table.This is the reason, alluded to in Chapter 2, Introduction to the X Toolkit and Motif, why it is not possible to bind two different actions to a single and a double
click of the same button in the same widget.  Specifying:ID="SC-1013-8-46"<Btn1Up>(2):  quit()  \n\
<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:  confirm()will invoke the confirm() action on a single click
and both the confirm() and quit() actions on a
double click.This behavior was a design decision on the part of the X
Consortium.  Otherwise, the Intrinsics could never dispatch the
single-click action until the double-click interval had passed,
since it would have no way of knowing if a second click was
coming.  Applications needing to have single and double clicks in
the same widget must do so by designing the two actions
appropriately, rather than relying on the Translation Manager to
make the distinction.
ID="IX-1013-8-129" SPAN="END"eventsevent sequencesID="S3-1013-8-13"Event Sequences Sharing Noninitial EventsID="IX-1013-8-130" SPAN="START"eventsevent sequencesIf a noninitial event sequence is common between two translations,
each translation will match only event sequences where the preceding
event does not match the other translation.  Consider the
translation:ID="SC-1013-8-47"<Btn1Down>,<Btn1Up>:    actionB() \n\
<Btn1Up>:               actionA()When a Btn1Up event occurs, it triggers actionA() only if not preceded
by Btn1Down.The way this works is that Xt keeps a history of recent events.
When each event arrives, Xt compares this event and its immediate
history to the event sequences in a translation table.  An event
in the sequence may have already triggered an action, but that is
irrelevant.  Any translation whose final event in the event sequence
matches the current event and whose earlier event sequence matches
the event history is matched.  If there are two translations that
can match a particular event sequence, then the translations are
considered overlapping, the latter will override the former,
and Xt will print a run-time warning message at startup
(not waiting for the overlapping actions to be invoked).
This is an exception to the rule stated earlier that the
translation manager executes the first match.

accelerators are simply translation tables registered to map
event sequences in one widget to actions in another.
This is a general mechanism, but its name is based on a common
use--adding keyboard shortcuts for widgets that are normally
triggered by mouse button presses, such as PushButton
widgets--because for advanced users a keyboard interface is often
faster.What Motif calls accelerators are implemented using Xt's accelerators,
but the two are not at all the same.
Motif implements a more convenient interface for providing keyboard
shortcuts in menus, which it calls accelerators, but at the same time
disables the more general accelerators feature in standard Xt.
We will begin with a discussion of accelerators as
defined by Xt, using the Athena widget
set in the examples since they will not work in Motif.
Then we will proceed with how Motif accelerators and mnemonics work.
If you are interested only in how to program with Motif, then you can
skip to LINKEND="S2-1013-8-12"Section 8.2.5, "Motif Accelerators and Mnemonics."ID="S2-1013-8-8"Xt AcceleratorsEvery widget has an XtNaccelerators resource, inherited
from the Core widget class.  This resource contains an accelerator
table, which is identical in format to a translation table; it maps
event sequences to action sequences.  Accelerator tables can be
set into the XtNaccelerators resource in all the same ways
translation tables can.
The widget on which the XtNaccelerators resource is set is the
widget whose actions are to be invoked from events in other widgets.Once the XtNaccelerators resource of a widget is
set, the application must call XtInstallAccelerators() or
XtInstallAllAccelerators() to specify which widget
will be the source of the events to invoke the actions specified in
the accelerator table.
ID="IX-1013-8-133"XtInstallAcceleratorsID="IX-1013-8-134"XtInstallAllAcceleratorsID="IX-1013-8-135"acceleratorsinstallingThe MIT Intrinsics documentation refers to these two widgets as
the source and destination.
This can be confusing, especially since the arguments are referenced in
reverse order in the call to XtInstallAccelerators():ID="SC-1013-8-48"void XtInstallAccelerators(destination, source)
     Widget destination;
     Widget source;Just remember that
the source is the widget whose actions you want executed, and the
destination is the widget you want the events to be gathered in.
To understand the use of the
phrase install accelerators, think of the accelerators as the
XtNaccelerators resource of the source widget, together
with the actions of that widget, and the
destination as the widget to which these actions are
transplanted (i.e., "installed").XtInstallAccelerators() is always called from the
application.
(Widgets never install accelerators, because by definition
they don't know about any other widgets.)
In applications, accelerators can be installed any time, before or after the widgets are realized.    Just before the XtAppMainLoop() call is a good place.ID="IX-1013-8-136"XtInstallAcceleratorsID="IX-1013-8-137"XtInstallAllAccelerators
As an example, we'll add accelerators to the xbox1 application,
which is the Athena version of xrowcolumn
from Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets.  This application displays two Command widgets in a Box, as shown in

}The actual value of the accelerator table is set through the
resource mechanism.  The XtNaccelerators resource is set
for the widget whose actions are to be

in compiled form, in the widget's instance structure when the
widget is created.  When the application calls
XtInstallAccelerators(), the accelerator table stored in
the widget is merged with the translation table of the widget
that will be capturing the events.  (If XtRemoveAccelerators
is called, the original translation table, prior to merging with
the accelerators from the source widget, is restored.)

Notice that the accelerators are specified as a resource of the
source widget, even though the events that invoke them will
come from the destination widget.There are some differences in the translation tables that
can be used for accelerators.

If specified, the #replace directive is ignored.
It is important to realize that accelerators are merged with the
source widget's translations.  #override thus says that
the accelerators take priority over any matching translations
in the source widget, and #augment says that the
accelerators have lower priority.Parameters passed to actions must be quoted with double quotes.ID="IX-1013-8-144" SPAN="END"translationsinteractions betweenID="S2-1013-8-9"Event PropagationID="IX-1013-8-145"eventspropagationID="IX-1013-8-146"acceleratorsevent propagationIf you install accelerators in the Box widget as shown
in
LINKEND="EX-1013-08-2"Example 8-2, you will
notice that even though the destination widget is Box, keyboard input will also be accepted in the
children of box, including not only the quit
widget but also the pressme widget.
This is because of a characteristic of
X called event propagation.ID="IX-1013-8-147"XSelectInput Xlib functionThe server sends to the client only the types of events the client
selects.  Internally, Xt selects events using the Xlib call
XSelectInput().  From a Toolkit application, this is hidden
because the translation mechanism automatically selects the
appropriate event types specified in the translation table.
(As we will see in Chapter 9, More Input Techniques, Xt provides
a low-level event-handling mechanism that exposes event selection
more directly.)
ID="IX-1013-8-148"eventsselectingEvent selection reduces the amount of
network traffic, the number of events the server has to
generate, and the number of unneeded events the client must process
only to throw away.Most event types are selected on a per-window basis.  Each selected event
that arrives at the client contains the window ID of the window it was
selected for.  (Non-maskable events, the last five event types in
LINKEND="TB-1013-8-1"Table 8-1, are the exception; they are selected using a different
mechanism or are not selected at all.)
ID="IX-1013-8-149"eventsnonmaskableID="IX-1013-8-150"eventsnonmaskable; example of handlersPointer and keyboard events propagate through
windows that have not selected them, as shown below in
LINKEND="FG-1013-08-2"Figure 8-2.
That is, if the
pressme widget's window has not selected KeyPress
events, any key events that occur in that window will be passed on to
its parent, the Box widget.  If the Box widget's
window didn't select them either, they would be passed on to the
window created by the top-level Shell widget, and so on.  Events
propagate through the window hierarchy all the way to the
root window, until they reach a window that selected them.
(If no window has selected them, they are never sent by the server.)
Xt treats an event that originally occurred in some descendent widget
just as if it actually happened in the widget that selected the event.ID="FG-1013-08-2"Key event propagation in xboxFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="08.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-8-8"Propagation is a characteristic
of ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, KeyPress,
KeyRelease, MotionNotify, EnterNotify, and
LeaveNotify events only.  As mentioned earlier, keyboard
events are the events most often used as accelerators.ID="IX-1013-8-151" SPAN="START"commandCommand widgetIn the version of xbox we just looked at,
keyboard events propagate through
the Command widgets to the Box widget, because they are not selected
by the Command widgets.  When they reach the Box widget, they
match the events specified in the accelerator table and invoke
actions from the quit widget.The Command widgets have a default translation table that includes
pointer button events and enter/leave events.  Xt, therefore, selects
these events for each Command widget.  Before accelerators are
installed, the Box widget has no translation table and therefore has
no events selected for it.  When the accelerators are installed, the
accelerator table is merged with the (nonexistent) translation table
of the Box widget and becomes the Box's translation table.  Xt then
selects keyboard events for the Box widget.But consider the resource settings in
LINKEND="EX-1013-08-3"Example 8-3.ID="EX-1013-08-3"Conflicting translations and accelerators*quit.label:  Quit

for any key event.  With the resource settings in
LINKEND="EX-1013-08-3"Example 8-3, since pressme has
a translation for the p key, the q key will not propagate through the widget.
Therefore, it is often better to specify all key events as
accelerators and install them on a common ancestor.Accelerators are just merged into translations--they
are not a completely different mechanism.
The #augment (default) or #override directives
used in accelerator tables specify whether the accelerator should
override or augment existing translations for the destination widget.
For example, if box had a translation of its own that matched
the event sequence in the accelerator installed on the same widget,
whether the translation or the accelerator would be invoked depends on
whether #augment (the default) or #override had
been specified as the accelerator directive.  (This example is a
little farfetched, since the Box widget defines no actions or
translations--but it illustrates the point.)When using or writing widgets, event propagation is usually important
only for accelerators, because widgets are rarely layered in such a
way that any of the ones that accept input are obscured.ID="S2-1013-8-10"Installing Accelerators in Multiple WidgetsID="IX-1013-8-153"acceleratorsinstalling; in multiple widgetsIf you want to install accelerators from more than one widget,
you can call XtInstallAccelerators() once for every
widget whose actions you want executable from the destination.
Alternatively, you
can call XtInstallAllAccelerators() just once for a whole
application, specifying the application's
ID="IX-1013-8-154"XtInstallAllAccelerators

XtInstallAllAccelerators() recursively traverses the widget
tree rooted at the source, and installs the accelerators of each
widget onto the destination.For example, to install accelerators from both the quit

*quit.accelerators:      \n\
        <KeyPress>q:    set() notify()Because you would be most likely to specify distinct KeyPress
events to invoke the actions in each Command widget, you would
normally specify each accelerator resource separately, as shown
above.  But in the unlikely case that you wanted actions of
multiple Command widgets to be invoked by the exact same event, you could
do this instead.  For example:ID="SC-1013-8-50"*Command.accelerators:   \n\
        <KeyPress>:  set() notify()would invoke the set and notify actions of every
Command widget, but not of widgets belonging to other classes.Or assuming that there were multiple Box widgets in an
application, one containing options, and the other commands,
you might specify something like this:ID="SC-1013-8-51"*optionsbox*accelerators:   \n\
        <KeyPress>:  set() notify()to invoke the actions of every Command widget in

ID="IX-1013-8-157" SPAN="END"commandCommand widgetThe point is that,
like any resource setting, an accelerator table can apply

are used in a way that is completely different from that of
the standard Xt accelerators just described.When a RowColumn widget has been
configured to operate as a popup menu or MenuBar, its
XmNmenuAccelerator resource is activated.  This resource can
be set to a keysym which, when pressed, will pop up the popup menu
or move the focus to the first item in the MenuBar.  For example,
the effective default value for XmNmenuAccelerator for the
MenuBar is <KeyUp>F10.RowColumn also has a subpart which has an
XmNbuttonAccelerators resource.
The XmNbuttonAccelerators resource is set to an array of
keysyms, which when pressed will trigger the respective buttons.
The XmNbuttonAcceleratorText resource is an array that lets you
provide text that will appear in each button, to show the user the
accelerator for each button.All the resources that begin with XmNbutton can only
be used when a menu is created with a function that begins with
XmCreateSimple (there is one for each of the six types of
Motif menus).
These functions create a menu and populate it with children.
Here are the other RowColumn subresources that configure the children
as they are created:MARK="BULLET"XmNbuttonCountspecifies the total number of menu buttons, separators, and titles to
create.XmNbuttonsspecifies a list of compound strings to use as labels for the buttons
created.  The list contains one element for each button, separator,
and title created.XmNbuttonTypespecifies a list of button types associated with the buttons to be
created.
The list contains one element for each button, separator, and title
created.
If this resource is not specified, each button in a MenuBar is a
CascadeButtonGadget;
each button in any other type of RowColumn widget
is a PushButtonGadget.
Each entry in the button type array can have
several possible values such as XmPUSHBUTTON.These resources work only when set while creating a menu using
XmCreateSimple*Menu such as XmCreateSimplePopupMenu().
Setting them at any later time will have no
effect.  Some resources that configure the children of
menus are not listed here.ID="S3-1013-8-14"MnemonicsID="IX-1013-8-162"mnemonicsA mnemonic is a keyboard shortcut as well.  However, a mnemonic is
available only when a menu is visible, while an accelerator can
invoke a menu entry even when the menu is not visible.  Therefore,
accelerators must be unique application-wide, while mnemonics only
need to be unique within a single menu.  Consequently, a mnemonic
is a particular key regardless of modifiers, while accelerators are
usually key combinations such as Ctrl-C.A mnemonic is indicated in a button by underlining a character in
the button label.  Motif does this automatically as long as
the mnemonic you choose appears
in the label.  The XmNbuttonMnemonics subresource of RowColumn
specifies a mnemonic for each button created, but can only be used
while creating the menu with one of the XmCreateSimple*Menu
routines.
The list contains one element for each button, separator, and title
created.  The mnemonic for a particular button can also be set
using the XmNmnemonic resource of any kind of button widget.Further discussion of mnemonics is provided in the forthcoming Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual.

method when the accelerators are installed.  The purpose of this
method is to display to the user the installed accelerators.  The
method is passed a string representation of the accelerator
table, which the method can theoretically manipulate into a form
understandable by the user.All Motif widgets just set this method to NULL.
All of the Athena widgets
inherit the Core widget's display_accelerators method by
initializing the appropriate member of the class structure to
XtInheritDisplayAccelerators.  This default method, as
implemented in the MIT distribution, does nothing.
ID="IX-1013-8-166" SPAN="END"acceleratorsaboutID="CH-1013-9-1" NUMBER="9"More Input TechniquesMore Input TechniquesThis chapter describes how to handle events with event handlers,
and how to use information from the event structure inside an
event handler or action routine.  It also describes
how to get file, pipe or socket input, how to use timeouts to
call a function after a delay or at particular intervals, and how to
use work procedures to do background processing.  Finally, it
discusses some low-level features of Xt for directly interacting
with the event queue.ID="IX-1013-9-1"event handlersaboutIn addition to translations, there is a lower-level mechanism called
event handlers.  Event handlers can be used from application
or widget code.  An event handler is a function registered with
ID="IX-1013-9-2"XtAddEventHandlerXtAddEventHandler() to be called in response to a particular
event or group of events (but not an event sequence or detail, as
is possible with translations).  This is a low-level,
non-user-configurable means of getting events.  Event handlers
provide no additional capabilities over translations and actions.
But they allow Xt to skip the step
of searching a translation table before dispatching the event to an
event handler.  This speed advantage is possibly
significant for events that come in large numbers, such as pointer
motion events, or in applications with large translation tables.
(Despite this speed difference, good performance in tracking pointer motion can be achieved
with translations.)Both event handlers and actions are passed as an argument the actual event
structure that caused them to be invoked.  Many event handlers
and actions use data in the event.  For example, a
routine handling motion events may want to obtain the current
pointer position from the event structure.  After describing how to
add and remove event handlers, we discuss the event structures
and show a routine that uses specific event data.Next,
this chapter discusses three ways to
register functions Xt will call for input other than events,
since some programs do not live by X events alone.MARK="BULLET"XtAppAddInput() registers a procedure to be called when input is
available from a file (or pipe or socket).  This procedure can be used
to perform code necessary when reads, writes, or exceptions are
detected.XtAppAddTimeOut() registers a function to be called at
a particular relative time.  This function can be used to implement
delays or to execute code repeatedly at known intervals.XtAppAddWorkProc()registers a work procedure.  Work procedures are called when input
from other sources is not available.  They perform
background tasks while the application is waiting for user input.Finally, we provide more background on how the Toolkit dispatches
events from XtAppMainLoop(), and describe the low-level
routines that can be used to construct your own main loop.
We also describe Xt's event filters, which are
controlled by flags in the Core class structure. These filters tell
Xt whether or not to compress multiple motion, enter, leave, or
expose events occurring in the same widget.ID="S1-1013-9-1"Event HandlersID="IX-1013-9-3" SPAN="START"event handlersAn event handler is a function you provide to handle a particular
type of event or group of event types.  You register this function
with a call to XtAddEventHandler() or
XtInsertEventHandler(), specifying the widget in
which the events are to be monitored.  The difference between these
two functions is described below.You can later stop the function from being called
with XtRemoveEventHandler().  On any widget, you can register as
many event handlers as you want, each for the same or for different types
of events. When more than one routine is registered for an event, the
order in which they are invoked is undefined.ID="IX-1013-9-4"event handlersreasons to useWithin Motif applications, event handlers have one common
use;  they are used to pop up Motif popup menus.  A
popup menu is mapped where the user presses a mouse button in
a particular widget, usually the application's main window.  Since
the application's main window probably doesn't have an
XmNactivateCallback resource, the function
that pops up the menu can't be registered as a callback.
It can be registered as an event handler, however,
because this requires no prior agreement from the widget.
This function could also be added as an action from the application,
but the required translations could interfere with the operation
of the main window if it already uses ButtonPress events.
Event handlers have the advantage that they work in parallel
with Xt's other event dispatching mechanisms,
and therefore they don't interfere.
LINKEND="EX-1013-09-1"Example 9-1 shows how a typical application uses an event handler.  The meaning of each argument will be described in a moment.ID="EX-1013-09-1"Using an event hander to pop up a popup menustatic void

}Within widget code, event handlers are used for various special
requirements of individual widgets.  For example, RowColumn uses
an event handler to implement keyboard mnemonics in menus.  Manager
uses event handlers to generate synthetic events for its gadget
children.  (Since gadgets do not have windows, they would normally
not get EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events.  So the
Manager widget class keeps track of the pointer position, and when the pointer
enters one of the gadget children, Manager sends that child a synthetic
EnterNotify event.)In general, however,
event handlers are infrequently used in application or widget code.
None of the Athena widgets use them, and, out of the 40 applications
in MIT's core distribution, only xterm and xman
use them. As mentioned earlier, event handlers are useful for handling
high-volume events, such as MotionNotify events, with maximum
speed.  An event handler for motion events would probably be the best
way to implement a drawing program.  However, translation tables
provide good speed even for motion events on most systems.
ID="IX-1013-9-5"MotionNotify eventID="IX-1013-9-6"eventsMotionNotifyEvent handlers would also be
useful when the type of events being handled changes frequently,
because there is some overhead involved in compiling
and merging translation tables.  Event handlers can also be used to handle
events for which the user-configurability of translations is not needed
or wanted, such as EnterWindow, LeaveWindow,
FocusIn, and FocusOut events.

handling of certain events when there is a very large translation table.
For example, editors typically have a large number of translations for
various key combinations.  If an editor was to accept pointer motion
as well (to allow drawing of simple graphics), it might pay to handle
motion events in an event handler instead of through translations.ID="IX-1013-9-15"XtAddEventHandlerID="IX-1013-9-16"eventsevent masks; aboutID="IX-1013-9-17"event handlersadding
The call to XtAddEventHandler() specifies which events trigger
the event handler function.  This is done with
an event mask argument.LINKEND="FN-1013-9-1"ID="FN-1013-9-1"The event mask used in XtAddEventHandler() is the same as
the one used in the Xlib call XSelectInput().
ID="IX-1013-9-18"XSelectInput Xlib function
In an event mask, each bit represents one or
more event types.  Symbolic constants are defined by Xlib for each
event mask bit.  Multiple types of events can be selected at the same
time by ORing together different masks with the bitwise OR
operator (|).
Note that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between event
masks and event types.  Some event masks select only one event, but others
select multiple events.  Furthermore, several of the masks select the same
event type, but specify that it be delivered only when it occurs under
special conditions.

events.  These can also be handled with an
event handler, but not by specifying them in the event mask.  An
argument to the XtAddEventHandler() call,
non_maskable, is a Boolean value that, if
True, specifies that the event handler should be called
for nonmaskable events.
This event handler then must branch according to which of the seven types
of nonmaskable events it is passed.  A typical nonmaskable event handler
is shown in LINKEND="S2-1013-9-2"Section 9.1.2, "Adding Nonmaskable Event Handlers."ID="S2-1013-9-1"Adding Event HandlersID="IX-1013-9-22" SPAN="START"registeringevent handlersEvent handlers are added with a call to

the handler is
being added, an event mask, a flag that specifies whether or not
this handler is for nonmaskable events (see below), the name of
the handler, and optional client data.  XtInsertEventHandler()
takes these and one additional argument: the position, either
XtListTail or XtListHead.A list of event handlers can be registered for the
same event; but the same function will appear only once in the list
with the same client_data.  If the same
ID="IX-1013-9-25"XtInsertEventHandler

XtAddEventHandler(), nothing will happen except that the
event mask for that function may change.  But if the same

non_maskable argument is set to False, or the event mask argument is set to zero and non_maskable is set to True.
LINKEND="EX-1013-09-1"Example 9-1 demonstrated the former case; now we'll look at the latter.ID="S2-1013-9-2"Adding Nonmaskable Event HandlersID="IX-1013-9-29" SPAN="START"eventsnonmaskableID="IX-1013-9-30" SPAN="START"event handlersfor nonmaskable eventsThe non_maskable argument of XtAddEventHandler()
specifies whether the specified event handler should be called in
response to the events that can't be selected as described above.
The nonmaskable events are GraphicsExpose, NoExpose,
MappingNotify, SelectionClear,
SelectionRequest, SelectionNotify, and
ClientMessage.  The first two of these events are selected using
the graphics_exposure component of the GC, and the rest are
always sent to the client whenever they occur.
MappingNotify is automatically handled by Xt, so it isn't passed
to event handlers and you don't need to worry about it.
The selection events are described in
Chapter 11, Interclient Communications.Because there are several nonmaskable event types, a nonmaskable
event handler must be sure to branch according to the type of event,
and throw away any event types not handled.  You need not have all
the code to handle all the types in a single event handler.  Instead,
you can handle each type in a separate handler, each registered
separately.  However, each handler would still need to check the event
type because the entire list of them would be called for every
nonmaskable event.LINKEND="EX-1013-09-3"Example 9-3 shows the registration of a nonmaskable event handler and the handler itself, from xman.

XtAddEventHandler(); if there are parameter
mismatches, the call is quietly ignored.
For example, the client data argument may be used to distinguish between
different event handlers; if the client data argument does not
match that which was passed in the XtAddEventHandler(), then
XtRemoveEventHandler() will do nothing.
XtRemoveEventHandler() is also silent about failing to remove a
handler that was never added or a handler that was incorrectly
specified.ID="S2-1013-9-4"Adding Raw Event HandlersID="IX-1013-9-43"XtAddRawEventHandlerID="IX-1013-9-44" SPAN="START"event handlersrawID="IX-1013-9-45"raw event handlerseventsID="IX-1013-9-46"raw event handlersXt also allows you to add event handlers without actually selecting
events.  The main purpose of this feature is for Xt to register
functions before widgets are realized (because events can't be
selected until windows are created during realization).
Event handlers registered without selecting events are called raw event handlers, and are added
with XtAddRawEventHandler() or XtInsertRawEventHandler(),
which have the same calling sequences
as XtAddEventHandler() and XtInsertRawEventHandler().
The event mask indicates which events the handler
will be called in response to, but only when these events are selected
elsewhere.  Raw event handlers are supported mostly because they
are used inside Xt.  They are mentioned here only for completeness--you
are unlikely to need them.A raw event handler might be used to
"shadow" another event handler (both added with the same event
mask), such that until a primary event handler is added, the shadow
handler will never be called.
The primary handler will be added with XtAddEventHandler(),
which will select events, and then both
handlers will be called when the appropriate events occur.However, the "shadowing" technique is not necessary to assure that
multiple calls to XtAddEventHandler() don't result in wasted
XSelectInput() calls in which the event mask has not changed.
Xt keeps a cache of the event masks of each widget, and calls
XSelectInput() only when it is necessary to change the window's
event mask attribute in the server.Raw event handlers are removed with a call to
XtRemoveRawEventHandler().

client.  Xlib takes this packet from the network and places it into
an XEvent structure and places it on a queue until the client
ID="IX-1013-9-51"eventsevent structure
program requests it.  Xt requests events from this queue
and dispatches the event to the appropriate
action routine or event handler for the widget in which the event
occurred.  The event itself is passed as an argument to the
routine.LINKEND="FN-1013-9-2"ID="FN-1013-9-2"We'll look at the low-level routines Xt provides for
directly manipulating the event queue later in this chapter.Actually, XEvent is a C-Language
union of many event structures all the same size but with
some different field names.  The first member of the union, and
of any of the individual event structures, is the event
type.
LINKEND="TB-1013-9-2"Table 9-2, later in this section, lists the event
types and the matching event structure types.Many action routines are intentionally written not to depend on
the detailed information inside any particular type of event, so that
the user can specify translations to call the action in
response to different types of events.    For example, it is
useful for an action routine normally triggered by a pointer click
to work when called in response to a key instead.  Such an action
should not depend on the event structure fields unique to button
events.However, many other action routines, and most event handlers,
do use the detailed information
inside event structures.    The first member, type,
identifies which type of event this structure represents,
and hence implies which other fields are present in the structure.To access event structure fields other than type
you need to cast XEvent into the appropriate
event structure type.    If you are expecting only one type of event
to trigger this action, then you can simply declare the argument
as the appropriate type, as shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-09-4"Example 9-4.

}When an action routine or event handler
depends on the fields in a particular event
structure, it is a good practice to check the event type in that
action unless you are sure that the user can't change the
translation (and thus the events used to invoke the action).If you want the same code called for two
event types, then you would do better to create two separate
translations and two separate
actions that each call a common routine.  However, it is sometimes more
convenient to have an action called by two different events.
LINKEND="EX-1013-09-5"Example 9-5 shows the ToggleCell action from the BitmapEdit widget, which is called in response to
either MotionNotify or ButtonPress events.
This action inverts a pixel in the bitmap either if the pointer
is clicked on a cell in the widget, or if it is dragged across
the cell with the pointer buttons held down.

}ID="IX-1013-9-55"actionsusing event dataNotice that some code is repeated to cast the event structure to the
two different event types.  With the current MIT implementation of Xlib,
the positions of the x and y fields in the
XButtonEvent and XMotionEvent structures are the
same, and therefore this casting is unnecessary on many compilers.
However, for strict ANSI C conformance these casts are necessary, and
furthermore it is improper to depend on any particular implementation
of Xlib.  The order of the fields in one of these events could be
different in some vendor's implementation of Xlib.ID="S2-1013-9-5"Event Types and Structure NamesLINKEND="TB-1013-9-2"Table 9-2 lists the event
types and the matching event structure types.  The event
descriptions in the table will give you a general idea of
what each event is for.  Many of these events are not often used
in applications, and more of them are automatically handled by Xt.
We've already discussed how to use the most common event types
and their abbreviations in translation
tables in
Chapter 8, Events, Translations, and Accelerators.
Appendix C, Event Reference, in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, provides a complete reference
to the circumstances under which each event is generated,
what it is for, and the fields in
each of the event structures.  You will need this information to write
action routines that use event-specific data.

This is not merely reading the file once, but monitoring it for
further activity.  Under UNIX this can be used to get input
from pipes and sockets, since they are variations of files.
We will demonstrate getting file and pipe input in this section.The XtAppAddInput() routine takes four arguments:
a file descriptor, a flag (see below), your function, and
client_data.XtAppAddInput() returns an ID that uniquely identifies
the XtAppAddInput() request.  You can
use the ID to cancel the request later with XtRemoveInput().One argument of XtAppAddInput() is a file descriptor
(this file must be open before calling XtAppAddInput()).
Since implementation of files varies between operating systems, the
actual contents of the parameter passed
as the file descriptor argument to these routines is operating system-dependent. Therefore, this code is inherently nonportable.Possible values for the mask and their meanings are as shown in

}ID="IX-1013-9-66"XtAppAddInputID="IX-1013-9-67"XtRemoveInputThe function registered with XtAppAddInput() is called
with client_data (used for passing in any application data),
a pointer to the file descriptor, and the ID of the
XtAppAddInput() request.  You can use a call to
XtRemoveInput() in the function registered with
XtAppAddInput() if that function is only to be called once.
One argument of the XtRemoveInput() call is the ID
of the XtAppAddInput() request.Under some operating systems,
the function registered with XtAppAddInput() is called very
frequently even when no new input is available.  This is because Xt
makes a system call to detect whether the file is "ready for reading,"and some operating systems say the file is ready even when there is
nothing new to read.
The example shown above works, but it loads down the system
much more than necessary.  You may wish to check the file
every quarter second instead of continuously, by adding and removing
your input handler periodically using timeouts (as described in
LINKEND="S1-1013-9-4"Section 9.4, "Timeouts").
Under UNIX, this problem should happen only for files, not for pipes
or sockets.

that gets file input.  The only difference is that we use popen
instead of fopen, and change the various error messages.
Now instead of treating the command-line argument as a filename, it
is treated as a program run under a shell.  This program's output
is piped into our application.  For example, here is an example of
how to invoke this version of xpipeinput:ID="SC-1013-9-2"spike% xpipeinput "cal 11 1989"

26 27 28 29 30
(Program continues to monitor pipe for further input until application exits.)Note that xpipeinput is reading the string "cal 11 1989"from the command line, invoking a shell, running the command
specified by the string under this shell, reading the output of the
shell, and then printing it on the standard output.  This is an easy
way to use all kinds of shell scripts and utilities from within a
program.If you want your application to accept standard input, this is even
easier.  Remove the code that reads the filename from the command line
and remove the popen call to open the pipe, since the pipe
from stdin is always open.  
Then use the XtAppAddInput() function as shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-09-7"Example 9-7.ID="EX-1013-09-7"Reading stdin from an Xt application    XtAppAddInput(app_context, fileno(stdin), XtInputReadMask,

and then printing the output to stdout.  With more code, it could
display this calendar in a Text widget instead.

This is done by using XtAppAddTimeOut().  This routine is passed
a time interval in milliseconds, and the address of a function to be
invoked when the time interval expires.  As usual, a
client_data argument can also be registered.
The XtAppAddTimeOut() routine returns a handle that can be used
to cancel the timeout before it triggers, if necessary.A timeout is automatically removed when the registered
function is called.  Therefore, to have a function called
repeatedly, every N milliseconds, the registered function must add the
timeout again by calling XtAppAddTimeOut().ID="IX-1013-9-77"gamesID="IX-1013-9-78"xtetris

XtWidgetToApplicationContext().
ID="IX-1013-9-83"XtWidgetToApplicationContextNotice also that a timeout function is called with only one argument,
client_data.  Inside a widget, this argument is commonly used
to pass in the widget instance pointer.
Also notice that every time a block hits the bottom, the instance
variable delay is decremented by 5, which reduces the
number of milliseconds of delay used when XtAppAddTimeOut() is
next called.  In other words, the blocks fall progressively faster.xtetris also needs to remove a timeout in one of its routines.
The user can "drop" a block to score extra points (if there is enough
time).  Whenever a
block is dropped, the block is immediately moved down as far as it
will go, and a new block is started.  If the Drop action did
not remove the timeout, the new block would be started with a new
timeout while an existing timeout was already in force.  This would
mean that the MoveDown timeout function would be invoked
twice in quick succession when each of these timeouts expired.

}ID="IX-1013-9-86" SPAN="END"timeoutsremovingNotice that the timer ID returned from the calls to
XtAppAddTimeOut() is a global variable.  Xt
calls the timeout function with only one argument, and that
argument passes in the widget instance pointer.  We could
have created a structure containing the widget instance pointer and
the timer ID and passed its pointer to the timeout function.
But this wouldn't help, because the action routine in which
we remove the timeout is passed with no client_data argument.
(It has string parameters, but these are hardcoded in the actions
table.)  Therefore, we are forced to have a global variable for the
timer ID.Note that between the time when the timeout is registered and
when it triggers, the application processes events in
XtAppMainLoop().    Therefore, all the widget's actions and
expose method are in operation between the invocations
of the timeout function.

the application.  Since it is pointless for most games to continue
operating while obscured, it makes sense to remove the game's
timeouts when the game is partially or fully obscured (or iconified).
To do this, you can set the visible_interest
field in the Core class structure to True, and then check
the visible field of the Core instance structure
periodically.  When the application is fully obscured, you add a
separate timeout to continue testing the visibility status.
When the visibility status is satisfactory once again, the game
can add its timeout again.  All these changes are in the
widget's .c file.  First we set the visible_interest field to
True in the Core structure:
ID="IX-1013-9-91"timeoutsand visibility interestID="IX-1013-9-92"BitmapEdit widgetBitmapEditClassRecID="SC-1013-9-4"TetrisClassRec tetrisClassRec  = {

    .

    (w), w->tetris.delay, MoveDown, w);to:ID="SC-1013-9-6"if (w->core.visible == False)
            timer = XtAppAddTimeOut(XtWidgetToApplicationContext
                (w) 250, CheckVisibility, w);
        else
            timer = XtAppAddTimeOut(XtWidgetToApplicationContext
(w)
w->tetris.delay, MoveDown, w);And finally, we add the timeout function that continues to check
the visibility status.ID="SC-1013-9-7"static void
CheckVisibility(w)
BitmapEditWidget w;    /* client_data */
{
    if (w->core.visible == False)
        timer = XtAppAddTimeOut(250, CheckVisibility, w);
    else
        timer = XtAppAddTimeOut(w->tetris.delay,
                MoveDown, w);
}Unfortunately, the Core visible field is True even if a tiny
sliver of the widget is visible.  The only way to get around this
is to add an event handler (or translation) for
VisibilityNotify events and to add an instance variable to
maintain the visibility state.  The event handler or action would
check the state field of the event, and put the game into
hibernation if the window is only partially obscured.  However,
this approach has the opposite problem; it disables the game even
when only a sliver is obscured.There is nothing you can do about the game continuing to run while
being moved or resized with the window manager.
However, using the Core visible_interest field does stop
the game when it is iconified.

while an application is idle waiting for an event.  Work procedures
are registered with XtAppAddWorkProc().  They can
perform any calculation that is short enough that the routine will
return in a small fraction of a second.  If the work procedure is too
long, the user's response time will suffer.ID="IX-1013-9-97"XtRemoveWorkProcIf a work procedure returns True, then Xt will remove it and
it will not be called again.  But if one returns False, it will
be called repeatedly every time there is idle time, until the
application calls XtRemoveWorkProc().
A work procedure would return True if it performs a one-time
setup such as creating a popup widget.  It would return False
if it were continuously updating a disk file as security against a
system crash or server connection failure.You can register multiple work procedures, and they will be performed
one at a time.  The most recent work procedure added has the highest
priority.  Therefore, for example, if you want to create ten popup
widgets during idle time, you should add ten work procedures.  The
popup that you expect to need first should be added in the last work
procedure registered.The call to register a work procedure is shown in

}Remember that Xt cannot interrupt a work procedure while it is
running; the procedure must voluntarily give up control by returning,
and it must do so quickly to avoid slowing user response.If your application has any big jobs that it must do, the only way
to do them without resulting in long delays is to write the code
that does the big job in a way that voluntarily interrupts itself
and saves its state so that it can be restarted where it left off.
One way to run such a task is as a work procedure, but
this is only useful for tasks that need not be done before other
application tasks can begin.  If you want Expose processing to
continue but no other application task to begin until your task
is done, you would use the same type of code but place low-level
event management routines in it, or make the rest of the
application insensitive until the task is done.

XtAppMainLoop() to begin processing events.
XtAppMainLoop() itself is quite simple:  it consists of an
infinite loop calling two lower-level routines,
XtAppNextEvent() and XtDispatchEvent().
XtAppNextEvent() extracts the next event from the
application's event queue;
XtDispatchEvent() actually uses the event to invoke the
appropriate actions or event handlers.  (The functions
registered by XtAppAddInput() and XtAppAddTimeOut() are
dispatched directly by XtAppNextEvent(); if no events are
available, XtAppNextEvent() flushes the X output buffer, and
calls any work procedures registered by XtAppAddWorkProc().)
ID="IX-1013-9-103"XtAppNextEventID="IX-1013-9-104"XtDispatchEventAn application can provide its own version of this loop, as shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-09-12"Example 9-12.
For example, it might test some application-dependent global flag or
other termination condition before looping back and calling
XtAppNextEvent().  Or for fine-grained debugging, it might be
worthwhile to insert a routine that prints out the type of each event
dispatched.

XtAppMainLoop() where Xt can check to see if input is available
from any of the various sources.  If an application has long
calculations to make, the program may not return to
XtAppMainLoop() frequently enough to detect important input in a
timely fashion.  The application itself should, if possible, suspend
lengthy calculations for a moment to check whether input is available.
Then it can determine whether to process the input before continuing,
or finish the calculation.To detect whether input from any input source is available, you can call
XtPending().  This function returns a mask composed of a bitwise OR of
the symbolic constants XtIMXEvent, XtIMTimer, and
XtIMAlternateInput.  These constants refer to X events,
timer events, and alternate input events, respectively.

XtAppProcessEvent() combines some (but not all) of the

That is, while XtAppNextEvent() takes the next event from the

specify as a mask a bitwise OR of
the symbolic constants XtIMXEvent, XtIMTimer, and
XtIMAlternateInput.    This lets you select only some of these
event types for processing.  In addition, XtAppProcessEvent()
actually calls XtDispatchEvent() to dispatch X events, so
only this one call is necessary.

Widgets set these fields to True when repeated events of these types
are unwanted.  Each would be used in different situations.
If turned on, they tell Xt to search Xlib's

When the compress_motion filter is set to True, and
there is a series of MotionNotify events on the queue (which
occurs when the application gets behind in processing them),
the filter throws out all but the last one (the most recent position).
This is useful for widgets that need the most up-to-date position but
do not need a complete history of pointer positions.ID="IX-1013-9-123"enter/leave compressionID="IX-1013-9-124"EnterNotify eventID="IX-1013-9-125"eventsEnterNotifyID="IX-1013-9-126"LeaveNotify eventID="IX-1013-9-127"eventsLeaveNotify
The compress_enterleave filter throws out all
EnterNotify/LeaveNotify pairs on the same window in
which there are no intervening events.  This would be used by a widget
that is interested in enter and leave events, but not if the
application falls behind.  For example, even the Command widget sets
compress_enterleave to True.  It
highlights its border when the pointer enters, and clears it when the
pointer leaves.  But if for some reason the widget falls behind and has
not highlighted the border by the time the LeaveNotify event
arrives with no intervening events, the border will not be highlighted.
To see this, move the pointer quickly across a large panel of Command
widgets such as in xmh, and you will see that not all of them
draw and then undraw the border.ID="IX-1013-9-128"exposeexposure; compressionID="IX-1013-9-129"eventsExposeID="IX-1013-9-130"compress_exposure field
The symbols used for setting the
compress_exposure filter have changed in R4.
If the field of this name in the Core class structure is set to
False or XtExposeNoCompress,
ID="IX-1013-9-131"XtExposeNoCompress flag
a widget's expose method is called once in response
to each Expose event in a contiguous series.  Each event
specifies a different rectangle of the widget that needs
redrawing.With compress_exposure set to True or
ID="IX-1013-9-132"XtExposeCompressSeries flagXtExposeCompressSeries,
however, a contiguous series of events resulting from one
user action is compressed into a single
modified Expose event and the expose method is called
only once.  This modified Expose event contains the bounding
rectangle of the union of all the rectangles in the individual events.
In this case the expose method is also passed an Xlib
Region that describes in detail the area exposed.
Probably the most useful value for compress_exposure is
XtExposeCompressMultiple, which compresses all the contiguous
ID="IX-1013-9-133"XtExposeCompressMultiple
events resulting from multiple contiguous user actions.When ORed with any of the XtCompress* symbols,
the XtExposeGraphicsExpose symbol causes Xt to call the
expose method with any GraphicsExpose events that occur.
Remember that you must set the graphics_exposures component
to True in the GC used in XCopyArea() or
XCopyPlane() in order to get GraphicsExpose events.
XtExposeGraphicsExposeMerged, when ORed with an
XtCompress* symbol, merges contiguous Expose
and GraphicsExpose events together before calling the
expose method.The XtExposeNoExpose symbol causes Xt to dispatch
NoExpose events to the expose method.  This doesn't
make much sense; if you need NoExpose events it is better to
add an event handler or translation to handle them.The remaining symbol is XtExposeCompressMaximal.  This symbol
is dangerous and usually should not be used: it merges non-continuous
Expose events into one event before calling the
expose method.  This is unwise because the intervening events
could be ConfigureNotify events that change the size of the
window.  When this happens, the application will redraw itself,
then receive the ConfigureNotify, but then it will not
redraw itself in the new size because the Expose event
that would trigger the drawing has already been removed from the queue.Almost all widgets except those
that display a large amount of text should set this filter to
XtExposeCompressMultiple.
Text widgets can very efficiently redraw only the needed parts
of the window because each character is in a fixed location.
(Characters are in fixed locations in the Text widget because it
uses fixed-width fonts--this is not applicable to widgets that display
proportional fonts.)
Therefore, it can efficiently process all the Expose
events one at a time.ID="S2-1013-9-10"Input SensitivityID="IX-1013-9-134" SPAN="START"sensitivityThere are times when some widgets should be insensitive to events
in which they are usually interested.  For example,
a Command widget should be insensitive when the command that it
executes is already in operation.Widget sensitivity is inherited.  For example, if
a parent widget is insensitive, then its children are too.  In other
words, an entire box full of widgets can be set insensitive by
simply setting the box widget insensitive.  Note, however, that
this process can be a little slow because all the widgets in the
box that honor sensitivity will redraw themselves dimmed or
grayed.  A widget is made insensitive from an application by calling
XtSetSensitive() with the sensitive argument set to
False, or using XtVaSetValues() on the XmNsensitive
resource (XtSetSensitive() is slightly faster).Any widget that may need to be disabled for a time by the application
should change its visible appearance when insensitive.The widget that has one of the XtCallback* standard popup
callback functions registered on its callback list will automatically
be set insensitive when the callback is triggered.  If the
XtCallbackPopdown() callback function is registered
on this widget it will automatically be set sensitive again when this
callback is invoked.

work and how they should be used.  This chapter describes in
detail the resource file format and the rules that govern the
precedence of resource settings.  It also describes
how to add your own type converter so that you can have application
or widget-specific data set through resources.
Finally, it describes subresources and how to use them.This chapter provides a thorough discussion of how resources
work and how they should be used.  First, we describe how
to define resources, the
complete syntax of resource files, and the rules that describe the
precedence of one resource setting over another.
For the sake of completeness, and to make sure that the ideas are
presented in context, there is some
repetition of material that has been presented earlier.Next, the chapter describes the resource conversions performed
automatically by Xt.
ID="IX-1013-10-1"representation typesaboutID="IX-1013-10-2"convertersregistering
As you may recall from the discussion in Chapter 2, Introduction to the X Toolkit and Motif, a value converter
is invoked by Xt to convert a resource from the string form specified
in resource files to the representation type actually used in the
application or widget.  For the representation types
understood by Xt, simply listing the representation symbol (a
constant beginning with XmR, or XtR in standard Xt)
in the resource list is enough to make Xt automatically
perform the conversion.  But if you create a representation type
unknown to Xt, you need to write a type converter routine and register
it with Xt before the automatic conversion can take place.
We discuss both the standard converters and how to write a new one.Finally, the chapter describes a mechanism
Xt provides whereby widgets or applications may have
subparts with separate sets of resources.  Special routines are
provided for setting and getting these resources.  The R3
Athena Text widget used subparts to implement replaceable units that
provide the data storage and display for text data.  This allowed the
same central code to edit a disk file or a string.
But using subparts is now out of favor; the Athena Text widget and
the Motif Text widgets now use
objects to accomplish the same modularity (see Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques).ID="S1-1013-10-1"Review of Resource FundamentalsID="IX-1013-10-3" SPAN="START"resourcesaboutAs we've previously discussed, widgets and applications can
declare some or all of their variables as resources.  Not
every variable need be a resource--only those for which values
need to be supplied by the user (or for a widget, also by the application
programmer) through the Resource Manager.
Both applications and widgets may
use nonresource variables for internal bookkeeping, or for storing
values calculated or otherwise derived from resources.ID="IX-1013-10-4"XtResourceID="IX-1013-10-5"XtResourceList

}ID="IX-1013-10-7"resourcesresource list; declaringThe fields in the XtResource structure are used as
follows:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-10-8"conventionsresource; namesID="IX-1013-10-9"resourcesnamingID="IX-1013-10-10"conventionsresource; names
The resource name
is usually similar to the name of the variable being set by the
resource; by convention, the resource name begins with a
lowercase letter, and no underscores are used to separate
multiple words.  Instead, the initial character of subsequent words
is given in uppercase.
For example, the resource name for a variable named
border_width would be borderWidth, and
the defined constant used to refer to this name would be
XmNborderWidth.As previously described, the name, class, and representation type
of resources are specified in the resource list (and elsewhere in
Xt code, but not in user database files) using symbolic constants
defined in <Xm/Xm.h> (or <X11/StringDefs.h> in standard Xt),
and consist of the resource
name, class, or type preceded by the characters XmN,
XmC, or XmR, respectively.  Use of these constants provides
compile-time checking of resource names, classes, and types.
Without the constants, a misspelling would not be noticed by the
compiler, since resource names, classes, and representation types are
simply strings.  The misspelling would be considered a real
resource at run time.  Nothing would happen if it were set from
the application, because no widget would actually use it.
If, on the other hand, the misspelling were in the widget
resource list, the application's setting of the intended resource
would have no effect.Newly-defined resources may use a name, class, or type constant defined in
<Xm/Xm.h> (or <X11/StringDefs.h> if not using Motif), if
an appropriate constant exists.
Otherwise, the constant is defined in the widget's public header file,
or for application resources, in the application itself, or in
the application header file, if any.For many resources, the class name is simply the same as the
resource name, except that the XmC prefix is used, and,
the first letter of the name is conventionally capitalized.
For example, the class name constant for the XmNbackgroundPixel
resource is XmCBackgroundPixel.
However, when appropriate, a single class can be used
for a group of related resources.  This allows a single setting
in the resource database to control
the value of multiple resources.For example, a widget can have several elements that use
pixel values (i.e., colors) as resource settings:  background,
foreground, border, block cursor, pointer cursor, and so on.
Typically, the background defaults to white
and everything else to black.
If the background resource has a class of
Background, and all the other pixel resources a class of
Foreground,
then a resource file needs only two lines to
change all background pixels to offwhite and all foreground
pixels to darkblue:

10.3.5, Xt automatically converts values in the resource

performed automatically in this case as well.ID="IX-1013-10-18"XtRImmediate representation typeThere are two special resource types that can be used only as the
default_type.  XmRImmediate means that the value in
the default_address field is to be used as the actual resource
value, rather than as a pointer to it (or in the case of a string,
the value is a pointer to a string, rather than a pointer to a pointer to
a string).  The other special resource type, XmRCallProc, is a
pointer to a function that will supply the default value at run
time.  We'll demonstrate the use of these values in Section
10.3.3.

Xlib, but Xt adds a great deal.  While using the resource manager
from Xlib is cumbersome, from Xt it is easy:  to use
resources in existing widgets, all you have to do is write
the app-defaults file.ID="IX-1013-10-22"XtAppInitializeID="IX-1013-10-23"xrdb
Xt's handling of resources occurs in two stages:NUMERATION="ARABIC"When the application starts up, with a call to
XtAppInitialize(), Xt reads the app-defaults
file, along with several other resource files,
command-line options,
and the RESOURCE_MANAGER property stored in the
server by the user with xrdb.  (Any, all, or none of these may
contain data.)  It merges all these sources of data into one
internal database per screen (per display in R4, per screen in R5) 
that is used when each widget is created.ID="IX-1013-10-24"XtCreateWidgetID="IX-1013-10-25"XtCreateManagedWidgetID="IX-1013-10-26"XtVaCreateWidgetID="IX-1013-10-27"XtVaCreateManagedWidget
Whenever you create a widget, the call to
XtVaCreateManagedWidget() reads the resource database and
automatically sets widget resources to the values in the database.
In order to explain this stage more clearly, we further divide it
into two separate steps in the sections that follow.  First, Xt
compares
the settings in the database to the widget's class and instance
hierarchy, to find which settings apply to the widget being
created.  Second, Xt decides which one of the (possibly conflicting)
settings that apply to that widget should actually be used.If the value of a resource is hardcoded by
passing arguments to XtVaCreateManagedWidget() or
XtVaSetValues(), the hardcoded value overrides the value looked
up from the resource database.To retrieve the value of application resources from the database,
an application must make an explicit call to
XtGetApplicationResources(), as described in Section
3.6.3.

ID="FN-1013-10-1"Note the distinction between what we are calling the

ancestors.  A class hierarchy describes the class names of the widget's

of a mixture of instance names and class names (each of which
describes one generation in the widget's hierarchy), separated by
periods or asterisks.

the right component in the instance hierarchy.  A loose binding
means the left component must only be an ancestor of the right
component; there can be any number of levels in the hierarchy
between the two.Loose bindings are preferable because they stand a better chance of
working when the instance hierarchy changes.
Tight bindings are rarely necessary at every position in the
resource specification, since widget names are usually unique and
single widgets can be identified by name.  Furthermore, it takes more
text to specify the complete instance hierarchy for every widget to be
set.Using loose bindings,
the instance, class, or instance/class hierarchy may be abbreviated
to the point where
specifying the hierarchy as a single asterisk would
indicate that any instance
or class hierarchy (any widget in the application) will match.
However, care should be taken when using loose bindings.  One common
mistake is to abbreviate a hierarchy too much, so that resource
settings that were supposed to apply to only one widget now apply to
several.  This can be particularly serious (and hard to trace) when
the resources being set are translation tables or constraints.The resource name must be the string that appears in the resource
name or resource class field in a resource list.
This is the value of the XmN or XmC
symbolic constant used in that field of the resource list.Any entry that is not a resource specification/value pair or
does not match any resource for any widget in the application or
any application resource is quietly ignored (no warning message is
printed).  This means that a slight error in the
resource specification of an entry will cause that entry to be
quietly and completely ignored.  It is often difficult to detect such
errors.Lines beginning with an exclamation point (!) are treated as comments.
Some people have been using # instead, since it is currently supported
in MIT's sample implementation of Xt.  But # is not mandated in the Xt
specification and therefore may be eliminated in future sample
implementations from MIT or in a vendor's implementation.
You are advised to use the exclamation point.
(Even in the MIT implementation, # elicits warning messages from
xrdb.)

? to be used to wildcard a single component (name or
class) in a resource specification.  Thus the
specification:ID="SC-1013-10-5"xmail.?.?.Background: antique whitesets the background color for all widgets (and only
those widgets) that are grandchildren of the top-level
shell of the application xmail.  And the
specification:ID="SC-1013-10-6"xmail.?.?*Background: brick redsets the background color of the grandchildren of the
shell and all of their descendants.  It does not set
the background color for the child of the top-level

specifications simply cannot be done without the ?
wildcard; sometimes the * wildcard does not provide
the necessary fine-grained control.  To set the
background of all the grandchildren of an application
shell widget without the ? wildcard, it would be
necessary to specify the background for each grandchild
individually.There is one obvious
restriction on the use of the ? wildcard:  it cannot be
used as the final component in a resource
specification--you can wildcard widget names, but not
the resource name itself.
Also, remember that the wildcard
? (like the wildcard *) means a different thing in
a resource file than it does on a UNIX command line.The ? wildcard is convenient in cases
like those above, but it has more subtle uses that have
ID="IX-1013-10-42"* wildcard
to do with its precedence with
respect to the * wildcard, as discussed later.  First, note
the important distinctions between the ? and the *
wildcards:  a ?
wildcards a single component name or class and
falls between two periods (unless it is the first
component in a specification), while the * indicates
a "loose binding" (in the terminology of the resource
manager) and falls between two component names or
classes.  A ? does not specify the name or class of

existence of a component.  The * on the other hand
only specifies that zero or more components have been
omitted from the resource.

in the order shown in the list below.
The effect is that if there is a specification
that applies to a particular resource of a particular widget
instance in more than one of these locations, and these specifications
are of equal precedence, then the first one in this list is the one
used (the previous edition of this book presented this list in
the reverse order).  The unfamiliar topics touched upon in this

since R4, but the result is the same accept as

If the application has defined any command-line options
by passing an options table to XtAppInitialize(),
values from the command line
will override those specified by any other resource settings.ID="IX-1013-10-51"options-xrmAny values specified on the command line with
the -xrm option will be loaded for that instance of the program.A temporary database is created by parsing the
resources contained in the RESOURCE_MANAGERID="IX-1013-10-52"RESOURCE_MANAGER~property
property on the root window of the default screen of
the display.  If this property does not exist, the
contents of the file $HOME/.Xdefaults are used
ID="IX-1013-10-53".Xdefaults~file
instead.  The contents of the property or file are
assumed to be entirely in the X Portable Character Set
so that the database can be correctly
parsed before the application's locale has been set.
(See Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, Third Edition, for information about locale and the X
Portable Character Set.)If a language procedure has been set with
XtSetLanguageProc() (see Chapter 14, for more
ID="IX-1013-10-54"XtSetLanguageProc
information on the language procedure and the
internationalization of Xt programs), the
application command line is scanned (but not actually
parsed into a database) for the -xnlLanguageID="IX-1013-10-55"-xnlLanguage~command line optionID="IX-1013-10-56"xnlLanguage~resource
option or an -xrm option that specifies the
xnlLanguage resource.  (See LINKEND="S2-1013-10-6"Section 10.2.6, "The Language String" for a discussion of the language string.)
Because the command line
is scanned before the locale has been set, the value of
this resource must be in the X Portable Character Set.
ID="IX-1013-10-57"X Portable Character Set
If neither
command-line option is found, the temporary database is
queried for the value of the xnlLanguage
resource.  The value of this resource, or the empty
string if it is not found, is passed to the registered
language procedure which sets the locale and returns
its name.  The return
value of the language procedure is associated with the
display for future use (for example, by XtResolvePathname()).
ID="IX-1013-10-58"XtResolvePathname
All future resource specifications will be
parsed in the encoding of this locale, and resource
databases will have the locale associated with them.
XrmLocaleOfDatabase() will return the name of the locale.
ID="IX-1013-10-59"XrmLocaleOfDatabase functionThe application command line is parsed, and the
resulting resource specifications are stored in a newly
created database.  This database will be augmented with
resources from a number of sources and will become the
screen resource database.If a language procedure has not been set, the value of
the xnlLanguage resource is looked up in the
screen database, the temporary database, and the
environment variable LANG.  This language
ID="IX-1013-10-60"LANG~environment variable
string (or the empty string) is associated with the
display for future use.If the XENVIRONMENT environment variable is
ID="IX-1013-10-61"XENVIRONMENT~environment variable
defined, the resource file it points to is merged into the
screen database with XrmCombineFileDatabase();
the new resources do not override existing resource
values in the database.  If the environment variable
does not exist, the file
$HOME/.Xdefaults-hostname is used, if it
ID="IX-1013-10-62".Xdefaults-hostname~file
exists.
The difference between this and XAPPLRESDIR below
ID="IX-1013-10-63"XAPPLRESDIR~environment variable
is that this is a complete path name including the file name.The per-screen specifications stored in the SCREEN_RESOURCES property
ID="IX-1013-10-64"SCREEN_RESOURCES~property
are merged into the
database.  The new resources do not override existing
values in the database.
The user can set the SCREEN_RESOURCES property using xrdb.
This is intended to be the method whereby the user specifies screen-wide
resources (to apply to all clients no matter which system they are
running on).The temporary database which was created in step 1, and
which contains the per-server RESOURCE_MANAGER
ID="IX-1013-10-65"RESOURCE_MANAGER~property

resources in the temporary database do not override the
resources in the screen database.
The user can set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property using xrdb.
ID="IX-1013-10-66"xrdb client
This is intended to be the method whereby the user specifies server-wide
resources (to apply to all clients no matter which system they are
running on).The screen database being built is associated with the
display with a call to XrmSetDatabase(), and the
old value of the "display database" is saved so that it
can later be restored.  The user's application specific
app-defaults file is searched for, using
XtResolvePathname() with the path specified by
the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable if
ID="IX-1013-10-67"XUSERFILESEARCHPATH~environment variable
it exists.  If this environment variable does not
exist, a default path is used relative to the user's
home directory and relative to the value of the
XAPPLRESDIR environment variable, if that exists.
XtResolvePathname() uses XrmGetDatabase()
to find the current database of the display (which is
the screen database created up to this step), and uses
that database to look up the value of the
customization resource for substitution into
the path.  If a resource file is found in one of these
paths, the resource specifications in it are merged
into the screen database using
XrmCombineFileDatabase().  The new resources do
not override the resources already in the database.The application's app-defaults file is located
using XtResolvePathname() and the path specified
in XFILESEARCHPATH, or a default path if that
ID="IX-1013-10-68"XFILESEARCHPATH~environment variable
environment variable does not exist.  As above,
XtResolvePathname() looks up the value of the
customization resource in the screen database
ID="IX-1013-10-69"customization~resource
constructed so far.  The resources from the
app-defaults file are merged into the screen database
using XrmCombineFileDatabase(),
and do not override resource values already there.  The
original "database of the display," which had been
stored away in step 8 above, is restored using
XrmSetDatabase().If no app-defaults file is
located in step 9 and the
application has registered fallback resources with
XtAppSetFallbackResources(), then those fallback
ID="IX-1013-10-70"XtAppSetFallbackResources
resources are merged into the screen database without
overriding the values already there.ID="IX-1013-10-71"resourcessources priorityThe order in which these various sources are loaded, as shown in
the list above, is the order of their priority.
That is, those that are
loaded first override those loaded later if both specifications
have the same precedence and affect the same widget or widgets.If a resource value is hardcoded in the arguments of the call
to create a widget,
that value takes precedence over
any value for that resource in the resource database.
If a widget is created and no setting exists
in the database for a particular resource, the value
pointed to by the default_address field of the
resource list in the widget is used.  This is also true for
application resources and subresources.LINKEND="FG-1013-10-1"Figure 10-1 shows where Xt looks for resource files and in what order, on most UNIX-based systems.  The exact directories
are operating system and implementation dependent.
Remember that the app-defaults file is written by the
application writer, and all the rest of the resource sources are
for the user.  In practice, few users use more than one or two of
these sources of resource settings.

allow a special syntax involving % (the percent symbol) to
substitute various elements into the path.For example, the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable
is a colon separated path.  Under Sun OpenWindows, the
openwin script appends the string "/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S" to
the XFILESEARCHPATH variable.  The effect
is that app-defaults files are found in the directory
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults.XtDisplayInitialize() reads the environment variables,
makes the % syntaxes into paths with XtResolvePathname(), and uses
XtFindFile() to actually find
the files.  %T becomes the type arg of
XtResolvePathname(), %S
becomes the suffix arg, and %N is the filename arg.
Type is a category of files, such as app-defaults, help or bitmap.
Suffix is file suffix such as .txt.
So in your example, %T is app-defaults, and %N%S is the
complete filename.This syntax can get much more complicated when it includes
%l, %L, %t, and %c, all of which have to do with
internationalization, and %C, which is for specifying different
files for different types of displays (usually color and mono), as
described in LINKEND="S2-1013-10-11"Section 10.2.11, "Customized Resource Files."ID="S2-1013-10-5"Including Files in a Resource FileID="IX-1013-10-79"#include filesID="IX-1013-10-80"#include filesID="IX-1013-10-81"filesincluding in resource filesID="IX-1013-10-82"resource filesincluding files inID="IX-1013-10-83"XrmGetFileDatabaseID="IX-1013-10-84"XrmCombineFileDatabaseThe Xrm functions that read resources from files,

line of the form:ID="SC-1013-10-7"#include "filename"as a command to include the named file at that point.
The directory of the included file is interpreted
relative to the directory of the file in which the
include statement occurred.  Included files may
themselves contain #include directives, and
there is no specified limit to the depth of this nesting.
Note that the C syntax
#include <filename> is not supported;
neither Xlib nor Xt defines a search path for included files.The ability to include files is useful
when producing a special app-defaults file for use on
a color screen, for example, you can simply include the monochrome
app-defaults file and then set or override the color
resources as you desire.  This technique is
particularly useful when producing app-defaults files
for use with the customization resource described
below.

preprocessor to provide C include, macro, and
conditional processing.  The include functionality
described here is provided directly by Xlib.ID="S2-1013-10-6"The Language StringXt's resource handling is designed to support
resource files in different languages.  The goal is to have all the
language dependencies of an application in files, so that just by
selecting a different set of resource files and localization files at
run time, the
application will operate correctly in another language.LINKEND="FN-1013-10-2"ID="FN-1013-10-2"See the discussion of internationalization in Chapters 10 and 11
of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, Third Edition.ID="IX-1013-10-85"resourcesxnlLanguageID="IX-1013-10-86"xnlLanguage option
The language to use is selected with a language
string, which is an application resource defined by Xt:
"xnlLanguage" (no symbol XmNxnlLanguage is defined
for it).  The
default language string is NULL, which makes Xt operate
in English, with all files in the locations used prior to when the
internationalization features were added.  But when the *xnlLanguage
resource, or the LANG
ID="IX-1013-10-87"LANG environment variable
environment variable, is set to a
language name such as "spanish," Xt looks first in certain
directories for the Spanish app-defaults and user defaults files, before
defaulting to the normal app-defaults or user defaults directories.Note that all app-defaults and user defaults files
have the same name (the class name of the application);
only the directory in which they are first examined for changes
according to the language string.  Therefore
it is possible to have all the files for all the languages
installed on a system at the same time.The search path for resource files is implementation dependent,
but it is always begins with a language string-based directory.
Each app-defaults file on UNIX-based systems is normally in a
directory /usr/lib/X11/$LANG/app-defaults.
When the user sets LANG to "spanish," for
example, Xt looks for an app-defaults file first in
/usr/lib/X11/spanish/app-defaults.The path searched for user defaults files (which have the
same name as the app-defaults file) is more complicated.
If the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable is defined,
Xt follows that path.  If it is not defined but the XAPPLRESDIR
environment variable is defined, Xt will look in $XAPPLRESDIR/LANG
first before looking in $XAPPLRESDIR.  If
XAPPLRESDIR is not defined either, Xt looks in $HOME/LANG and
then $HOME.The remaining resource setting sources are not affected by the
language string.  As described in the previous section, the next
source of resource
settings merged is the RESOURCE_
MANAGER
property set with xrdb,
or if not set, .Xdefaults,
followed by the file specified by the XENVIRONMENT environment
variable, or if not set, the .Xdefaults-host file.For a summary of the path of resource files searched by Xt,
see
LINKEND="FG-1013-10-1"Figure 10-1.Most western languages other than English use characters with
accents or other marks.  These are non-ASCII characters,
in the second half of the ISO Latin-1 character set.  Most
fonts now in the X distribution provide glyphs (bitmaps) for these
characters.  Therefore, all you have to do is specify these characters
in your app-defaults file in the directory named for the desired
language.  However, most standard English keyboards do not provide a
way to type non-ASCII characters (and some computers can't store
them).  Because of this, the resource file format has been augmented
to provide a special syntax for specifying non-ASCII characters.
Each character is specified using a backslash followed by a
three-character octal number that represents the character.
You can use xfd to determine the proper octal number to use.
Just click on the desired character to have its index displayed.
This index is the number you enter in the app-defaults file.
For example,
LINKEND="EX-1013-10-3"Example 10-3 shows a Spanish app- defaults for xhello.ID="EX-1013-10-3"An app-defaults file for the Spanish language*hello.fontList:      *courier-bold*18*iso8859-1
*hello.labelString:   \161Hola, Mundo!The sequence \161 produces the inverted exclamation point that
begins the Spanish exclamatory sentence.  It is important to know for
sure that the font you choose has the desired glyphs.  Note that
iso8859-1 means ISO Latin-1, so that if you specify it in
your font name, you are guaranteed to have all ISO-Latin-1 characters.
Many of the fonts in the misc directory (such as the standard
terminal fonts) do not include these characters.
Also note that strings such as \161 may not work on systems that can 
only handle seven bit (ASCII) characters (they ignore the eighth bit).ID="S2-1013-10-7"Screen-specific Resource Strings and DatabasesID="IX-1013-10-88"resource stringsscreen specificID="IX-1013-10-89"resource databasesscreen specificID="IX-1013-10-90"XResourceManagerStringID="IX-1013-10-91"RESOURCE_MANAGERThe (pre-R5) function, XResourceManagerString(), returns the
contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on
the root window of the default screen of the display.
This property contains the user's resource customizations in
string form, and is usually set with the program
xrdb.  It is read by
XtDisplayInitialize() when creating the resource
database to be used by an application.  Until R5 this
single RESOURCE_MANAGER property contained
resources for all screens of a display, and there was
no way for a user to specify different resources for
different screens (for example, color
vs. monochrome).ID="IX-1013-10-92"SCREEN_RESOURCESsetting resources inIn R5, xrdb can set resources in the
SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of
each screen of a display.  XtDisplayInitialize()
reads the SCREEN_RESOURCES specifications and
uses them to override the screen-independent
RESOURCE_MANAGER specifications.  The resource
database that is created in this way is the database of the
screen, rather than the database of the display.  If
the same application is executed on different screens
of a display, or if a single application creates shell
widgets on more than one screen of a display, a
resource database will be created for each screen, and
the application instances or shell widgets will find
resources in them that are appropriate for that screen.Recall that XtDisplayInitialize() creates
databases using resources from a number of sources
other than these window properties, so in many
cases resource databases on different screens will
contain substantially the same values.  Note, however,
that the SCREEN_RESOURCES property can be used
to set the customization resource and thereby
cause different app-defaults files to be merged into
different screen databases.  Screen-specific resource
databases are created by Xt only as needed, so an
application running exclusively on the default screen
of a two-screen system will not have the overhead of
maintaining two per-screen databases.Two new functions support
screen-dependent resources and resource databases.  The
contents of the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on
the root window of a screen are
returned by the function XScreenResourceString().
The database of a screen may be obtained with the
function XtScreenDatabase().  The function
XtDatabase(), which prior to R5 returned the
(single) database of the display, is now specified to
return the database of the default screen of the
display.The client xrdb has been rewritten for R5 to
handle the new screen-specific properties.  Any load,
merge, or query operation can now be performed on the
global RESOURCE_MANAGER property, a specific
screen property, all screen properties, or all screen
properties plus the global property.  This last option
is the default and "does the right thing"--the input
file is processed through the C preprocessor once for
each screen, and resource specifications that would
appear in all of the per-screen properties are placed
in the global property and removed from the
screen-specific properties.  With this new system, a
defaults file which uses #ifdef COLOR to
separate color from monochrome resource specifications
can be used to correctly set the values of the
screen-dependent and screen-independent properties for
a two-screen monochrome-and-color display.  An
application can then be run on either screen and find the
correct user defaults for that screen.
LINKEND="EX-1013-10-4"Example 10-4 shows a user default file that takes advantage of the new xrdb functionality and the
customization resource to set different
defaults on color and monochrome screens.

#endifWhen an Xt application creates a shell widget with
XtAppCreateShell(), the value of the
XtNscreen resource is used to determine what
screen the shell should be created on and
which screen's resource database should be used to look up the
widget's resources.  But the value of the XtNscreen
resource must be looked up itself.  The Xt
specification resolves this circular problem by stating
that the value of the XtNscreen resource is looked up
first in the argument list passed to
XtAppCreateShell(), and then in the resource
database of the default screen of the display.  If it
is found, then all further resources are looked up in
the resource database for that particular screen.  If
the XtNscreen is not found, then the widget is
created on the default screen, using the database for
that screen.ID="S2-1013-10-8"Fallback ResourcesID="IX-1013-10-94"fallback resourcesAs you may recall from Chapters 2, 3, and 4, XtAppInitialize()
has an argument in which you can specify fallback resources,
which we didn't use.
Many applications won't operate properly without their
app-defaults file.  Fallback resources are a defense in
case the user doesn't install the app-defaults file, or if
something happens to prevent access to it.  They provide minimal
application-specific resource settings that either allow the
application to run safely or instruct the user to
install the app-defaults file properly.If your app-defaults file is small, you can (and should) put the
whole app-defaults file in the fallback resources.  However, if your
app-defaults is large, it probably makes more sense just to
set one or more labels in the application to tell the user that
the app-defaults file is not
installed properly or cannot be accessed.
Remember that the fallback resources are used only if the app-defaults
file is not found.
Fallback resources are a NULL-terminated list of strings, each
containing a resource setting.

hierarchy together with its resource names and classes are
compared to each entry in the merged resource database.  To demonstrate
how matches are made, we'll look at a sample widget hierarchy and
follow the process of finding the value for one resource of one
widget from the merged resource database.
LINKEND="FG-1013-10-2"Figure 10-2 shows the widget instance hierarchy for the quit widget in the xrowcolumn application shown in Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets.
The figure also shows the corresponding fully specified
instance and class names for the quit widget.
This section describes how this widget's resources are set by 
the resource manager.LINKEND="FN-1013-10-3"ID="FN-1013-10-3"The actual algorithm used by Xt differs slightly
from that described here, because there are shortcuts that the
resource manager takes that are hard to follow even if you
have the source code.  However, the algorithm described here gives the
same result, with more clarity.ID="FG-1013-10-2"The quit widget in a sample widget hierarchyFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="10.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-10-4"We know that quit is a Command class widget and
therefore that Xt will be searching the resource database for each resource
in Command's resource list (and the resources in its superclasses'
resource lists).  It will search for one resource at a time.
To demonstrate the conflicts that can occur,
we'll use the Core resource XmNbackground, which
is common to all widgets.  It will
appear in the resource database as background.The matching process can be thought of as a process of elimination.
Let's assume the merged resource database is as shown in

eliminates entry 4.
The fully specified instance and class hierarchies are then

as well as the one beginning with xrowcolumn,
matches xrowcolumn, the first component of the fully specified

Since entry 8 actually contains the string xrowcolumn, the
xrowcolumn component is removed for comparison at the next level.
Entry 8 now begins with .background.  Similarly, the R5
ID="IX-1013-10-100"? wildcardexample
? wildcard in Entry 9 matches any single instance or class in the
hierarchy, so it matches xrowcolumn or XRowColumn.
Therefore, the leading * and the ? in Entry 9 are removed for
comparison at the next level.
Entry 9 also now begins with .background.The first component of each resource specification (after removal
of previously matched components) is now
compared to the second element in the widget's class and instance
hierarchies.  This should be either
rowColumn or XmRowColumn.    All the entries that begin with * still
match, because * matches any number of levels in the hierarchy.
However, there is no second element in entries 8 and 9, since the
resource name background is not counted.  Therefore, entries
8 and 9 are eliminated.  Also, since entries 1, 6, and 7
actually contain the strings rowColumn or
XmRowColumn, the leading asterisk and the strings
rowColumn and XmRowColumn are removed
before comparison
of the next level.

value.  The resource manager actually eliminates one of these entries
based upon the levels at which each entry matched, whether the instance
name or class name matched, whether a tight or loose binding was used,
and which had more elements specified.
These are the precedence rules to be described in the next section.
In order to keep the example clearer,
we'll pretend that the resource manager keeps the information
necessary to apply all
the precedence rules, and keeps all the entries, until the end.Now the contents of the resource database are compared to the third
component in the widget's instance and class hierarchies, quit and
XmPushButton.
As usual, anything beginning with an asterisk or anything beginning
with a period (.) followed by either the expected class or instance name
is a match.  This matches all but entry 1, which
is eliminated.Before going on to the next comparison,
any components that matched specifically (a . or *
followed by either string) are removed,
which results in the resource database
shown in

in the merged resource database will be alike.  (Remember that
we are using the term
specification for the part of the resource setting up to and
including the colon.)  For example, the merged
database could never contain both of the following:ID="SC-1013-10-8"XBitmap*rowColumn*background: green
XBitmap*rowColumn*background: redbecause the merging process would remove the setting
that appeared earlier in the list of database sources (or
that appeared later in a single file).However, the database could contain two or more resource settings that
apply to the same resource of the same widget, because of
differences in the widget class or instance hierarchy or the bindings.
For example, the database could contain:ID="SC-1013-10-9"XBitmap*rowColumn*background: green
XBitmap*quit.background: redIf the quit button is a child of rowColumn, both settings apply to
the quit button's background.The resource manager provides a set of rules that govern which
setting takes precedence in cases where there are two settings for
the same resource of the same widget.
Here are the three rules:NUMERATION="ARABIC"A resource that matches the current component by name,
by class, or with the ? wildcard takes precedence
over an resource that omits the current component by
using a *.ID="SC-1013-10-10"XBitmap*Form.quit.background:      and
XBitmap*Form.Command.background:   and
XBitmap*Form.?.background:         take precedence over
XBitmap*Form*background:A resource that matches the current component by name
takes precedence over a resource that matches it by
class, and both take precedence over a resource that
matches it with the ? wildcard.ID="SC-1013-10-11"*quit.background:                  takes precedence over
*Command.background:               takes precedence over
*?.background:A resource in which the current component is preceded
by a dot (.) takes precedence over a resource in which the
current component is preceded by a *.ID="SC-1013-10-12"*box.background:                   takes precedence over
*box*background:Situations where both rule 2 and rule 3 apply often cause confusion.
In these cases, remember that rule 2 takes precedence since it occurs
earlier in the list above.  Here is an example:ID="SC-1013-10-13"*box*background:                   takes precedence over
*box.Background:To understand the application of these rules, let's return to our
extended example.  In the course of developing that example, we
eliminated information about the level at which components
occurred.  However, the actual process of matching applies the
precedence rules at each step.  As a result, let's start again
with the
original appearance of the entries that pass the matching test.
The remaining five as they appeared originally are shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-10-9"Example 10-9.ID="EX-1013-10-9"Resource database finalists in original form*background:                          red            (entry 2)

*rowColumn*background:                pink           (entry 7)From here on, we will determine not only which one of these five will
take effect, but the actual precedence of the five.  In
other words, once the one with highest precedence is determined, we'll
see which would take effect if that one was commented out, and
so on.The precedence rules are applied in order to determine the order of
the finalist entries.NUMERATION="ARABIC"Rule 1 specifies that a specification that
contains higher components in the instance or class hierarchy takes
precedence over one that contains
only lower ones.  The highest components that appear in our example are
rowColumn and XmRowColumn in entries 6 and 7.  Therefore, these
two have higher priority than any others.To choose between these
two, we continue to Rule 2.  Instance names
(rowColumn) take precedence over class names (XmRowColumn).
Therefore, entry 7 has the highest precedence, followed by entry 6.
Note that the precedence comparison of two finalists proceeds in the
same manner as the original matching--from left to right in the
entry, one component at a time.To determine the precedence of the remaining three entries, 2, 3, and 5,
we begin again with Rule 1.  However, Rule 1 does not apply because
no two entries here specify different levels in the hierarchy.
Entries 3 and 5 contain the quit level and entry 2 nothing (an
asterisk does not count for Rule 1 because it is not a specified level--it
is any level).  Rule 2 specifies that the instance name quit takes
precedence over the class name XmPushButton, and therefore entry 3 has
higher priority than entry 5.  Rule 3 does not apply, because
no two entries are identical except for binding.  Because of
Rule 4 we know that both entries 3 and 5 are higher priority than
entry 2, because 3 and 5 state a name or class that is omitted in 2.Therefore, the final precedence is as shown here:ID="SC-1013-10-14"1.    *rowColumn*background:                pink    (entry 7)
2.    *XmRowColumn.XmPushButton.background: violet  (entry 6)

4.    *XmPushButton.background:             yellow  (entry 5)
5.    *background:                          red     (entry 2)People get used to the fact that they can set the resources of all 
the children of rowColumn with something like entry 7, 
but then are shocked to find that nothing happens when they attempt
to override entry 7 with entry 3--entry 3 seems more specific to them.
Even the following entry (using a class name) takes precedence over entry 3
because the rule about being higher in the widget hierarchy carries
more weight than
the rule that instance names take precedence over class names:ID="SC-1013-10-15"*XmRowColumn*background:    pink        (entry 7)ID="IX-1013-10-103"app-defaultsrecommended bindingsFinally, a note about creating app-defaults files.
Consider what happens when users specify a line like
*Background: grey in their personal resource
files.  They would like to set the background of all
widgets in all applications to grey, but if the
app-defaults file for the application "xmail" has a
specification of the form *Dialog*Background: peach, the
background of the dialog boxes in the
xmail application will be peach-colored, because this
second specification is more specific.  So if they
really don't like those peach dialog boxes,
(pre-R5) users will have to add a line like
XMail*Background: grey to their personal
resource files, and will have to add similar lines for
any other applications that specify colors like "xmail"does.  The reason this line works is rule 1 above:  at
the first level of the resource specification, "XMail"is a closer match than *.This brings us to the specific reason that
the ? wildcard was introduced in R5:  any resource
specification that "specifies" an application name with
a ? takes precedence over a specification that
omits the application name with a *, no matter how
specific the rest of that specification is.  So
in R5, the frustrated users mentioned above
could add the single line:ID="SC-1013-10-16"?*Background: greyto their personal resource files and achieve the desired
result.  The sequence ?* is odd-looking, but correct.
The ? replaces a component name, and the * is
resource binding, like a dot (.).The solution described above relies, of course, on the
assumption that no app-defaults files will specify an
application name in a more specific way than the user's
?.  If the "xmail" app-defaults file contained one of
the following lines:ID="SC-1013-10-17"xmail*Dialog*Background: peach
XMail*Background: maroonthen the user would be forced to explicitly override
them, and the ? wildcard would not help.
To allow for easy customization, programmers should write
app-defaults files that do not use the name or class of
the application, except in certain critical resources
that the user should not be able to trivially or
accidentally override.  The standard R5 clients have
app-defaults files written in this way.The moral of this story is that you should choose the bindings
in your resource file to reflect how easy (or difficult) you want
to make it for users to override your specifications.
(But of course, even a specification containing only tight bindings
can still be overridden by a user specification that also includes
all tight bindings.)Be careful with tight bindings, however.
Since there are no messages telling you which resource specifications
are actually being used, you can be tricked into thinking that you have set
resources that you actually haven't.
ID="IX-1013-10-104"appres utilityID="FG-1013-10-3"Steps in matching resource entries for one resource of widget being createdFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="10.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-10-5"A useful tool for figuring out the priority of resource files
is the appres utility.  You specify the class name of the
application on the command line, and appres shows you what
resource settings that application will see when run.  Note, however,
that this does not tell you how these resource settings will actually
apply to the widgets in the application, since appres has no
knowledge of the widget instance hierarchy in your application.Another tactic in tracing resource settings is to build a routine into
your application that
gets and prints all the critical resources of a widget.  Using
ID="IX-1013-10-105"XtGetResourceListXtGetResourceList() you can get the list of resources supported
by a widget class.  Then you can query each of those resources
and print most of them out.  Remember that certain resources
are compiled into internal forms, so you can't print out translation
tables, accelerator tables, or callback lists.  It may also be difficult
to interpret other values, since many of them will have already been
converted from the string form in the resource file into the most
convenient internal form.
For example, colors will have been changed
from strings such as "red" into a pixel value (a number which could
change each time the application is run).

with multiple app-defaults files so that users could
use the xnlLanguage resource to specify what language
the application should display itself in.  But it was
not possible to install one app-defaults file for use
on monochrome screens and another for use on color screens
and allow the user to specify, through a resource,
which file was to be used.  Applications are
moved between color and monochrome environments far
more often than they are ported to other languages,
and in X11R5 the X Toolkit allows a user to easily
specify which resources should be used.You may recall that XtResolvePathname() searches for a
file by performing printf-type string
substitutions on a specified or default directory path.
ID="IX-1013-10-110"%LID="IX-1013-10-111"%T
The string "%L" is replaced with the
language string (the value of the xnlLanguage
resource), for example, and the string "%T" is replaced with the
type of the file--"app-defaults," "bitmap," "help,"etc.  In X11R5, XtResolvePathname() supports a
ID="IX-1013-10-112"%CID="IX-1013-10-113"XtResolvePathname
new substitution variable "%C," which is replaced with
the value of the application resource named

default or user-provided XFILESEARCHPATH will
contain filename path components of the form %N%C%S--name,
customization, suffix.  Then a system administrator
could install app-defaults files (which do not have suffixes)
like XMail-color
and XMail-mono and a user could run the
xmail application as follows:ID="SC-1013-10-18"xmail -xrm "*customization: -color" &in order to get the app-defaults file with color
defaults.  (Unfortunately, X11R5 Xt does not define a
standard -customization command-line option
to set the value of this resource.)
The system administrator would also have to
install an uncustomized app-defaults file, XMail,
for use when no customization is set.
This file could be a symbolic link to the monochrome
file, or it could be a base resource file that
contains all the resources except
those that affect color.  Then the customized files
could simply include the base file with the new #include
feature.  The hyphen in the
customization name (-color) is not part of the Xt specification;
it is simply a useful convention that makes for legible
customized resource filenames (like XMail-color).ID="IX-1013-10-117"customizationsresourcesID="IX-1013-10-118"customizationsspecifying multiple
The customization resource was designed primarily to
allow color customizations, but there are other
possibilities as well:  app-defaults files with
customized translations that work with a single-button
mouse might be installed with a
-single-button customization, or files
customized for use within a specific group or
department of an organization could be selected by
department name.
Note, however, that because there is
no way to specify multiple customizations with the
single customization resource, (e.g., users
couldn't specify that they wanted both color resources
and single button translations) this technique should
not be overused.  In general, it should be reserved for
the color vs. monochrome customization for which it was
designed.ID="IX-1013-10-119"XFILESEARCHPATHID="IX-1013-10-120"XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
A related change in X11R5 is to the Xt specification of
the default paths to be used when the
environment variables, XFILESEARCHPATH and
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH (on UNIX systems), are not defined.  In X11R4,
these paths were required to contain specific
directories in a specific order.  The individual
directories in X11R4 had a fixed substitution order:
language (optionally), type, name, and suffix.  This
order meant that an application's auxiliary files
(app-default, bitmaps, help text, etc.) had to be
installed in scattered locations throughout a file
system.  In X11R5, the default paths still have a
required number of entries in a specified order, but
the order in which substitutions appear in these path
entries is no longer specified.  This means that
vendors may choose default paths for their
implementations that allow auxiliary files to be
installed in a single directory.
The MIT implementation
retains the substitution order of X11R4,
except for the insertion of the "%C" customization
substitution between the name and suffix substitutions.
When using a vendor-supplied X11R5, be sure to check
your documentation for the default file search path.

specifying translation tables as resources.  Because a
translation table is a multi-line resource, it is
useful to be able to override or add individual lines
to the table rather than always replace the table.
Application developers often do this in their
application's app-defaults file, using the
#override or #augment directive as part
of the XtNtranslations resource value.
Sometimes, though, users would also like to add or
override individual translations, but if they specify
a value for the XtNtranslations resource in a
personal resource file, it will take precedence over
the resource in the application's app-defaults file,
and the application's customizations will be lost from
the database before the widget ever sees them.  So
until R5, users had to
duplicate the application's translation settings in its app-defaults
file and then modify their copy.In R5, there is a new resource,
XtNbaseTranslations, that can be used by an
application developer to specify a base set of
translations that will be correctly overridden,
augmented, or replaced by the value of the
XtNtranslations resource.  Note that this is an
Xrm resource, but is not a widget
resource in the usual Xt sense of the word (the Xt
specification uses the term "pseudo-resource")--it does
not correspond to an instance field in Core or
any other widget class, and it cannot be set with
XtSetValues() or queried with
XtGetValues().  The value of the
translations field of the Core widget is
handled specially by the Xt resource management code.
The final value for a widget's translations are
obtained as follows:NUMERATION="Arabic"The default value of a widget instance's translations
are obtained from the Core widget class field
tm_table.  These translations are specified by
the widget writer.When a widget is initialized, the Intrinsics' resource
management code looks up the value of the
XtNbaseTranslations resource for that widget,
and if it exists, uses the translations it specifies to
replace, override, or augment the widget's default
translations.  These translations are intended to be
specified exclusively by the application developer in
the application's app-defaults file.Finally, the value of the XtNtranslations
resource is looked up for the widget, and if it exists
the value is used to replace, override, or augment the
widget's translations (which may have once already been
replaced, overridden, or augmented).  These translations
are intended to be specified by the end user of the
application.For maximum flexibility to the user, all R5
applications should specify translations in a resource
file using the XtNbaseTranslations resource
rather than with XtNtranslations.  If the same
resource file is to be used by applications compiled
under both the R5 and R4 versions of the
Intrinsics, then the resource file should specify the
application's translations as the value of both
resources.  Under R4, the
XtNbaseTranslations resource will be ignored,
and under R5, any value of the
XtNtranslations resource specified by the user
will override the value specified in the application's app-defaults file.ID="S1-1013-10-3"Type ConversionID="IX-1013-10-126" SPAN="START"convertersID="IX-1013-10-127" SPAN="START"resourcestype conversionYou already know that Xt is capable of converting resource values
from the string representation specified
in resource files to the actual type required in code.  In fact, Xt
does so automatically if the resource list is properly written.
This section describes this process in more detail, and tells you how
to create converters for converting your own data types.In R4, a new set of interfaces for type converters was introduced.  The new interfaces support display-specific conversions and better control of
converted-value caching.  This section describes these new interfaces,
but does not describe the older ones.  Be aware that many existing
widgets and applications still use the older interfaces.ID="S2-1013-10-13"Conversions from XmRStringThe primary purpose of converters is to allow resource files
to contain string values for nonstring program variables.  (They
are also used internally to convert default values that cannot be
specified easily in  the desired data type.)  Secondly,
converters confine the details of data
conversion to a single routine that is registered with Xt.
This is a big benefit because users of the converted types need not
know the details of how the conversion takes place, or the internal
definition of the target type.Xt provides converters from XmRString
to the representation types listed in
LINKEND="TB-1013-10-2"Table 10-2.
You can use these representation types as target types in resource
lists in applications or widgets, without having to register them, if
you want the user to be able to specify the resource in a resource file.

Most of the Xt converters allow the resources of the base classes
Core, Composite, Constraint, and Shell to be set from resource files.
Motif provides numerous converters that allow the resources of
its widgets to be set from resource files.  However, not all
Motif widget resources can be set from resource files,
because the needed converters are not provided.
(As of Motif 1.2, Motif now includes a StringToWidget converter,
which allows Form and other constraint resources to be set from
resource files.)

ID="IX-1013-10-181"XmRAcceleratorTable representation typeIn addition,
the Xmu library contains several useful converters.
For example, Xmu provides a converter that converts from a filename
(string) to a bitmap suitable for use as an icon pixmap.
Even though Xmu (like Xaw) is not part of the X Consortium standard,
it is part of MIT's core distribution and is available on most systems.
However, because the Xmu converters are not built into Xt, you need to
register them with a call to XtSetTypeConverter() or
XtAddConverter() (from widget code) or
XtAppSetTypeConverter() or XtAppAddConverter() (from
application code) before using them in an application or widget.

to register them in LINKEND="S2-1013-10-16"Section 10.3.4, "Registering Type Converters.")ID="S2-1013-10-14"Other Built-in Type ConversionsWhile the conversions from XmRString are the most widely

Its predecessor, XtAppAddConverter(), is still available
and can still be used, but has reduced functionality.
XtAppAddConverter() cannot be used for conversions that require
a server query (such as those involving colors or fonts), and does
not provide the caching control provided by XtSetTypeConverter().
Note that the explicit application context version of the call
(XtAppSetTypeConverter())
is not used in this case,
because the class_initialize method does not pass in
a widget from which the application context could be determined.The first two arguments of XtSetTypeConverter() are the source
and target type, respectively, specified using
XmR symbolic constants defined in <Xm/Xm.h>(or defined in an application header file or the widget public header
file if the type is not standard in Xt).The third argument is the name of the converter routine, which
by convention contains the string
Cvt.    The Xmu converters all add the prefix Xmu.
ID="IX-1013-10-235"Xmu libraryThe fourth and fifth arguments of XtSetTypeConverter() are an
argument list that will be passed to the converter routine when it is
called.  Some converter routines require information about the
context in which the converter is called.  This is usually passed
in via an XtConvertArgRec structure, as described in the
next section.  If no arguments are needed, the fourth and fifth
arguments of XtSetTypeConverter() can be NULL and 0
respectively.ID="IX-1013-10-236"cachingresourceID="IX-1013-10-237"conversion caching
The sixth argument specifies whether the results of the
conversion should be cached.  The basic symbols are XtCacheNone,
XtCacheAll, and XtCacheByDisplay.
Expensive conversions should be cached.
Xt caches resource values to
avoid repetitive conversions of the same value, which
are common in an application made up of many identical widgets.
It is especially important to cache conversions that require
round-trips to the server, such as color, font, and atom conversions.
But it is wasteful of memory to cache silly conversions such as
XtCvtStringToGeometry, which actually doesn't do any conversion
or even validity checking. (The XmRGeometry representation type
is a geometry string, as defined by XParseGeometry().  It
takes no conversion to convert XtRString to
XtRGeometry.  The converter could at least test the string to
make sure it looks like a geometry
string.)  Another benefit of caching is that Xt remembers unsuccessful
conversions and efficiently generates warning messages without
attempting any conversion more than once.The symbol
XtCacheRefCount can be ORed with any of the above values,
in which case Xt keeps track of how many widgets still exist that
used a converted value, and frees the cached value when the count
reaches zero.  The application, if it uses the converted value
in a call to XtGetApplicationResources(), is also counted
as one reference.  Reference counting is needed only if an
application destroys widgets whose resource values may take
up extensive space.  Because reference counting takes up
space and requires time, it should not be done unless necessary.
To control reference counting on a widget-by-widget basis, an
application must explicitly set the
XmNinitialResourcesPersistent resource to
ID="IX-1013-10-238"XmNinitialResourcesPersistentFalse for each widget whose conversions are to be reference
counted.  These should be widgets that might be destroyed before the
application exits.The seventh argument of XtSetTypeConverter() is a pointer to
ID="IX-1013-10-239"XtSetTypeConverterID="IX-1013-10-240"resourcescachingID="IX-1013-10-241"cachingresourceID="IX-1013-10-242"destructors
a procedure called a destructor.  If the reference count
for a particular resource reaches zero, Xt calls the destructor
function, and removes the resource value from the conversion
cache.
The destructor will also be called when XtCloseDisplay() is
called if the converter was registered with XtCachePerDisplay.
Before calling XtCallConverter() or XtConvertAndStore()ID="IX-1013-10-243"XtCallConverterID="IX-1013-10-244"XtConvertAndStore
to convert a value, the client must allocate memory in which to place
the result.  The job of the destructor is to deallocate this memory.
If you are allowing Xt to convert data automatically, by declaring
a resource list, Xt allocates the memory, and you don't need a
destructor (so specify NULL).  If you plan to call
XtCallConverter() from an application, and you allocate
memory statically for the converted value, you don't need a
destructor function and can specify NULL for this
argument.  A destructor is needed only if you allocate memory
dynamically for an explicit call to XtCallConverter().
(Remember that reference counting happens only if
the converter is registered with XtCacheRefCount set and
XmNinitialResourcesPersistent set to False for
at least one widget.  If these conditions are not met, the
destructor is only called when XtCloseDisplay() is called
and if registered with XtCachePerDisplay.)Xt provides several functions for manipulating reference counts,
which are rather obscure and mentioned
here only for completeness.  XtAppReleaseCacheRefs() explicitly
decrements the reference counts for resource values converted with
XtCallConverter().  This would be used in the rare occasion where
a value has been cached but you don't want it cached.  If this is
the last reference to the conversion, the registered destructor is
called.  Xt also defines two built-in callback functions that
decrement reference counts, XtCallbackReleaseCacheRef() and
XtCallbackReleaseCacheRefList().ID="S3-1013-10-1"Passing Arguments to a Type ConverterID="IX-1013-10-245"type converterspassing arguments toSome type converters need to be registered with additional arguments

in
LINKEND="EX-1013-10-16"Example 10-16  looks complicated, but in practice almost all
converter argument lists will look very similar to the one in this
example.  The
argument list is specified as an XtConvertArgRec:
ID="IX-1013-10-248"XtConvertArgRecID="SC-1013-10-19"typedef struct {
    XtAddressMode address_mode;
    XtPointer address_id;
    Cardinal size;
} XtConvertArgRec, *XtConvertArgList;The address_mode field specifies how the address_id
field should be interpreted.  address_id itself is a pointer
to the needed data, an offset within the widget instance structure to
the data, or a function that provides the needed data.
The size field specifies the length of the data in bytes.By specifying the address mode as XtWidgetBaseOffset (see
below), you can use XtOffsetOf() to find
the offset of appropriate data in the instance structure.LINKEND="FN-1013-10-6"ID="FN-1013-10-6"You can also use XtOffset() instead of XtOffsetOf(),
but it is less portable.  The usage difference between the two is
that XtOffset() takes a pointer to the structure type, while
XtOffsetOf() takes the structure type itself.
All you have to do is change the name of
the instance structure field (in this
case core.parent), and the structure type that contains that
field (in this case WidgetRec).  Notice that a pointer
to this structure type appears in the sizeof call (in this
case Widget).You have just seen the normal way of specifying the converter
arguments.  Using different XtAddressMode values you can
also specify them in other ways.

Both have the same arguments, but XtConvertAndStore() returns
Boolean while XtConvert() returns void.
XtConvertAndStore()'s return value indicates whether the
conversion succeeded or failed.  XtConvertAndStore() also
implements new display-specific conversion, caching and reference
counting features.
This may be useful in an application, such as for reading an icon
pixmap from a file using a converter, or you may need to explicitly
invoke a converter from within a converter you want to write.
(Converter routines can themselves invoke other converters directly.)One possible manual use of type converter routines is in the
processing of the string parameters passed to action routines.  Perhaps
in the action routine itself it is more convenient to have some
parameters converted to another form.  For example, if an
action is passed the string "True," the action code might prefer to
convert this parameter to a Boolean value.  The
CvtStringToBoolean converter understands many strings that
would be interpreted as Boolean, such as "Off," "On," "True,""False," "No," and "Yes," in upper, lower, or mixed case.
It saves code to use the converter
rather than comparing a string to all these strings in your own
code.

the user to be able to set through resource files, and no Xt or Xmu
converter exists, you will need to
write (and register) a type converter from XtRString to your
type.
The first step in creating a converter is to decide upon the
characteristics of the string you will be converting from,
and the C-Language type you will be converting to.
Then you can copy an existing similar converter and fill in the code
to convert to your desired type.  Note that the R5 Athena widgets
still use a mixture of the old-style (R3) and new-style converter
interfaces.
To use the current converter
functions XtConvertAndStore() or XtCallConverter(), or
any of the cache reference counting features, you must define your
converter using the type XtTypeConverter.  The difference
between new-style and old-style type converters is just that
new-style type converters
have a display as their first argument, and they must do a
display-specific conversion when a server query is involved.
The new-style converters also must return TRUE or
FALSE to indicate whether the conversion succeeded.
LINKEND="EX-1013-10-17"Example 10-17  shows an Xmu converter that shows the essential elements of
a converter.  It has been modified to be compatible with the
new-style resource conversion routines such as
XtSetTypeConverter().

    }
}Note that Xt manages the cache of converted values: converter
routines are not responsible for caching their own returned data.
Notice that the XrmValuePtr arguments passed into the
converter are pointers to structures, not values.  The
XrmValue structure contains an address field and a size field.ID="IX-1013-10-280"XtDisplayStringConversionWarningXtDisplayStringConversionWarning() takes as arguments a
pointer to the Display structure, the string
that could not be converted, and the type to which it could not
be converted.  It issues a warning message
with name conversionError,
type string, class XtToolkitError, and the default message
string "Cannot convert "src" to type dst_type."(See Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques, for more
information on error and warning messages.)Many converters need to compare multiple strings in order to
convert a value.  For example, Motif's string to arrow-direction
converter has to determine whether a string matches XmARROW_UP,
XmARROW_DOWN, XmARROW_LEFT, or XmARROW_RIGHT.
Normally this would require up to four time-consuming string
comparisons for each conversion.  Instead, converters of this type
use a shortcut based on quarks.
ID="IX-1013-10-281"quarks
A quark is a unique integer ID for a string, of type
XrmQuark (defined by Xlib).  A call to the Xlib routine
XrmStringToQuark returns the quark for a string.
A converter determines quarks for each of its reference strings
(such as XmARROW_UP) only once during run time, and determines
a quark for each string to be converted.  Then quarks can be
compared quickly since they are just integers.
(See Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, for details on quarks.)When a nonstandard type converter that uses quarks is defined and
registered in widget code, the XrmStringToQuark calls
are normally placed in the class_initialize method just
before the XtSetTypeConverter() call.ID="S3-1013-10-2"Defining the Default ValueWhen performing conversions, such as from strings to
fonts or colors, for which there is no string representation that
all server implementations will necessarily recognize,
a type converter should define some set of conversion values
that the converter is guaranteed to succeed on, so that these can be used
as resource defaults.For example, Xt's default string-to-pixel converter recognizes the symbols
XtDefaultForeground and XtDefaultBackground.
ID="IX-1013-10-282"XtDefaultForeground constantID="IX-1013-10-283"XtDefaultBackground
As part of its conversion, it tests for these values, and establishes
the appropriate value based on the string value.

     }Although Motif uses Xt's string to pixel value converter when
colors are specified in resource files, it
uses its own algorithm to calculate the default value depending
on the type of screen and on the colors that can be successfully
allocated.

cannot operate independently.  It is just a further subdivision
of the widget into smaller pieces.
Gadgets and objects usually provide
a more elegant way to do this.Subresources allow subparts of
a widget to have separate sets of resources.  Since the R3 Athena Text
widget was the only example of the use of subresources in MIT's
core distribution, we'll describe how Text used
subparts and subresources so you can understand the motivation behind
them.  You can then compare this concept with the current Athena Text
widget which is implemented using objects.
Motif 1.1 and 1.2 also use subresources to fetch data that isn't
part of the primary widget structure. This happens for
resource data that is shared among widgets (gadget caching) or
that can't reside in the primary widget due to binary
compatibility (e.g., VendorShell resources).ID="IX-1013-10-289"Athena widgetsText widgetThe R3 Text widget has three parts:  the source, the sink, and the
coordinator widget.  The source manages the storage of data and the sink
manages how it is displayed.  The coordinator is the central
widget that manages the communication between the source and the
sink, and is inoperable without them.  Both the source and the sink
are replaceable pieces of code.  Xaw provides only one
source, which edits a string or disk file, and only one sink,
which displays text in one color and in one
font.  The idea of providing the subparts in the first place is that
they would allow enhancements to be made without changing the
basic editor functionality that is in the coordinator.  For example,
only the source and sink would need replacing in order to implement a
multifont and/or multicolor text widget.
ID="IX-1013-10-290"sourcein Athena Text widgetID="IX-1013-10-291"sinkin Athena Text widgetEach subpart has its own resource list so that it truly can be

get_values_hook methods are used by widgets that have
subparts.  They have the same function
as their nonhook counterparts, except that they process only the
resources of a subpart, and any subpart instance fields that depend
on the subpart resources.  These methods are called immediately after
their nonhook counterparts.However, the initialize_hook and set_value_hook
methods have become obsolete in R4 because their arguments have been
added to the initialize and set_values methods.
The hook methods are still called for compatibility with existing
widgets, but
new widgets should move the code that would have been in
the hook methods into initialize and set_values.The get_values_hook method is passed a single copy of the
widget instance structure (the new copy already modified in
the nonhook methods), and the argument list passed to the Xt routine
that triggered the method.  The
set_values and
get_values_hook methods simply take this widget ID and
argument list and pass them to XtSetSubvalues() or
XtGetSubvalues() respectively.  The
initialize method uses the contents of the argument
list to validate resource settings for subparts and to set
nonresource subpart data.The get_values_hook method is still used in R4.

resources.  Like the application, the subpart must have a structure
containing the fields to set through resources.  In the application
you call XtGetApplicationResources() or
XtVaGetApplicationResources() to set these fields.  In a
subpart, the analogous calls are XtGetSubresources() or
XtVaGetSubresources(), which
is called from the initialize method.

sets them.  However, because subvalues are not part of any widget,
these calls cannot identify what object is being queried or set
simply by passing the widget ID.  These calls have different
arguments than XtSetValues() and XtGetValues().  Instead
of the widget ID, you pass the pointer to the data structure, the
resource list, and the number of resources.  Therefore,
XtSetSubvalues() and XtGetSubvalues() can be invoked
only from within the widget or subpart.  Actually, all these routine
do is set or get the value in the specified structure.ID="IX-1013-10-309"methodsset_values_hookID="IX-1013-10-310"set_values_hook methodID="IX-1013-10-311"methodsset_values_hook
Any application using the widget will set or get subresources
using XtSetValues() and XtGetValues() as for normal
resources,
specifying only the coordinating widget as the first argument.
These calls are translated into XtSetSubvalues() and
XtGetSubvalues() calls by the set_values and
get_values_hook methods.  These methods are passed the
arguments from the XtSetValues() or XtGetValues()
calls and translate them into XtSetSubvalues() or
XtGetSubvalues() calls by adding the data structure and
resource list arguments.  But in addition, the
set_values method is responsible for validating the
resource settings passed in before it calls XtSetSubvalues(),
and for changing any nonresource subpart structure fields like GCs
that depend on resources.

an application and the window manager, and between two applications.
The application--window manager communication is
performed by code in the Shell widget.  The application sets shell
resources to control this communication with the window manager.
Application--application communication is usually done with a
process called selections.  This form of communication is already
implemented in most widgets that display text, but you may want to
implement it in your own custom widgets.  Selections can also pass
other kinds of data such as graphics.
How to use the Motif Clipboard is also described.
Finally, the concepts behind Motif 1.2 drag-and-drop are described.Applications share the server with other clients.  Server
resources, such as screen space and colormaps, must be
used in a responsible, consistent manner so that applications can
work effectively together.  In most window systems, the window
system itself embodies a set of rules for application
interaction.  However, the X Protocol, Xlib, and Xt
were all specifically designed to avoid arbitrary conventions, so that
they provide "mechanism, not policy."ID="IX-1013-11-1"mechanism without policyID="IX-1013-11-2"ICCCMID="IX-1013-11-3" SPAN="START"window manager
Instead, the conventions covering interclient communication are
described in a separate document, adopted as an X Consortium
standard in July, 1989, called the Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual (ICCCM).
This chapter will not fully describe the ICCCM, because
the job of implementing its rules is given over to a special
client called the window manager and a special widget class
called Shell and its subclasses.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-1"ID="FN-1013-11-1"If you do need to look up certain details of the ICCCM, see
Appendix L, Inter-Client Communication Conventions, in
Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.
The ICCCM is also included in troff source
form in the standard X distribution from MIT.
As a result the details of the ICCCM are, for the most part, irrelevant
to the application writer's needs.  Widget writers may need to
refer to it when implementing selections.ID="IX-1013-11-4"Shell widget; aboutIn X Toolkit programs,
the Shell widget returned by XtAppInitialize() and used
as the top-level window of the application automatically handles
most of the required interactions with the window manager.
However, the Shell widget needs additional information in certain
areas.  For example, the application needs to provide an icon
ID="IX-1013-11-5"iconsetting; pixmap
pixmap so that the window manager can iconify it properly.
The first section in this chapter describes how to set Shell
resources to control how an application interacts with the window
manager.  This portion of the chapter is
for application writers, regardless of whether you need to write
widgets for your application.The ICCCM defines the required information that must be sent by the
client.  The Shell widget class takes care of sending this information.
However, mwm, the Motif Window Manager, also allows the
application to send or be sent
optional information.  One set of information
warns the application when it is about to be killed or when one of
its windows is about to be destroyed.  A separate set lets the
application specify what kind of decorations it wants on its
top-level shell widgets.  The final set allows mwm
to notify the application when a certain entry on its system menu
has been selected.  This entry is normally added to the user's
.mwmrc as part of the application's installation
procedure.
ID="IX-1013-11-6"mwm.mwmrc fileID="IX-1013-11-7"selectionsaboutIn X Toolkit applications, widgets
can communicate with other widgets using a mechanism called
selections, which in turn is
based on an X mechanism for common storage called properties.
Whether the widgets involved in transferring selections are
part of the same application or different applications is irrelevant.
The communication between
widgets takes place without input from the application.
However, it can be used as a means of communication between
applications.
The second major section in this chapter will describe these concepts
and how to implement selections between your own custom widgets.
Only if your application requires a custom widget that must
communicate with other widgets should you actually have to write this
code.  Thus, this part of the chapter is primarily for widget writers.Motif 1.2 introduces another layer of abstraction over selections,
called drag-and-drop.  This is an optional user interface feature
where data can be moved or copied from one widget to another (in the
same or different applications) by dragging an icon.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-2"ID="FN-1013-11-2"Dragging is the act of pressing a mouse button with the mouse
over the object, and moving the mouse with the button held down.
The object is finally released by releasing the mouse button.
The most widely known implementation of the drag-and-drop concept is
the Apple Macintosh finder where files can be moved from one folder
to another by dragging them.  The Motif implementation is more general
however, since any type of data can be selected and dragged.
Motif drag-and-drop is built-in to the
Text, TextField, Label, List and most forms of Button widgets for
transferring text.
The details of how to implement drag-and-drop within
a widget are beyond the scope of this book, see the OSF/Motif
Programming Manual.  That book provides 60 pages on the subject,
as well as a 65 page example.ID="S1-1013-11-1"Window Manager InteractionsID="IX-1013-11-8" SPAN="START"window managerinteracting withID="IX-1013-11-9" SPAN="START"window managerhintsID="IX-1013-11-10" SPAN="START"hintsaboutThe window manager was introduced in
Chapter 1, Introduction to the X Window System, but little mention of
it has been made since then.  You may recall that the window manager
is just another client running on a server, except that it is given
special authority to manage screen space and other limited server
resources like colormaps.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-3"ID="FN-1013-11-3"Note that we are using the term resources here in a
general sense, rather than implying its Xt-specific meaning.
To let the window manager do a better job
of mediating competing demands of the various clients, each client
gives the window manager information called
window manager hints.  These hints specify what resources each
client would like to have, but they are only hints; the window
manager is not obligated to honor them, and the client must not depend
on them being honored.Application code has little to do to interact properly
with the window manager.  The Shell widget returned by
XtAppInitialize() takes care of setting the essential window
manager hints.  However, there are a number of optional window manager
hints that the application may wish to have passed to the window
manager.  This is done mainly by setting resources of the Shell widget.
Also, there are variations in window managers and it takes some
effort to make some applications work equally well under all of them.The next few sections describe the various resources of the Shell
widget, including how and when they should be set.  Because the Shell
widget is part of the Xt standard, these resources are present when
writing applications with any widget set.ID="S2-1013-11-1"Shell SubclassesThere are several types of Shell widgets.
The Shell widget class itself, specified by the class structure
pointer shellWidgetClass, is never instantiated directly in
applications.  Only its subclasses are used.
You have seen two subclasses of the Shell widget used earlier in this
books:  the one used for the application's top-level widget and the one
used for popups.  The application's top-level widget is created
by passing the class structure pointer
applicationShellWidgetClass as the widget class argument
ID="IX-1013-11-11"XtAppCreateShell
to XtAppCreateShell();
this call is also made internally by XtAppInitialize().
Popup shells for dialog boxes are created by passing
transientShellWidgetClass as the widget class argument
to XtCreatePopupShell().
ID="IX-1013-11-12"XtCreatePopupShellID="IX-1013-11-13"application contextsapplicationShellWidgetClassID="IX-1013-11-14"transientShellWidgetClass
There are two other subclasses of Shell that are commonly used in
applications.  One is the OverrideShellWidgetClass,
passed to XtCreatePopupShell() when the shell is used for
popup menus.  The convention is this:  the shell should be
an OverrideShell when the pointer is grabbed to prevent other windows
from getting input while the popup is up, and the shell should be
TransientShell for other popups.  This is discussed further
in Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups.ID="IX-1013-11-15"top-leveltopLevelShellWidgetClassThe other additional subclass of
Shell is topLevelShellWidgetClass, which is used to create
additional, non-popup, top-level shells.  Some applications have
multiple permanent top-level windows.  One of the top-level shells
would be of the applicationShellWidgetClass, and the rest
would be of the topLevelShellWidgetClass.  Each would have a
separate icon.ID="S2-1013-11-2"Setting Shell ResourcesID="IX-1013-11-16"Shell widgetresourcesShell resources are primarily a way for the user and the application
to send in data to be communicated to the window manager.
These window manager hints control several major areas of
window manager activity:  they manage screen space, icons, and keyboard
input.  We'll discuss these areas one at a time in the
following sections.
LINKEND="TB-1013-11-1"Table 11-1 lists the Shell widget's resources with a brief description of what they control, and whether the application, the user, or Xt normally sets them.As indicated in Column 3 of the table, some Shell resources are
intended to be set only once.
These set-once resources can be left to their default values, set in
the app-defaults file, or they can be set in the code before the Shell
widget is realized; but they should not be set with XtSetValues()
after realization.

The XmNwindowGroup resource is used to link popup windows
to an application's main window.  If not set explicitly,
XmNwindowGroup is automatically set to the top-level
ancestor of the popup shell, which is usually the application's
top-level shell.ID="IX-1013-11-56"resourcesXmNoverrideRedirect (Shell)ID="IX-1013-11-57"resourcesXmNtransient (Shell)
The XmNtransient and XmNoverrideRedirect resources
are set automatically by Xt depending on what kind of Shell widget
you create.  For top-level application shells, both are set to
indicate that the window manager should treat this window as a
top-level window.
For TransientShell popup shells,
XmNtransient is set automatically to the shell specified in
XmNwindowGroup.  When the top-level window is iconified, the
TransientShell popup will also be iconified.  The TransientShell may
also be decorated differently from main application shells.

The XmNwaitForWm and XmNwmTimeout resources
control the response to delays by the window manager when responding to
geometry change requests.  By default, XmNwaitForWm is
True, and XmNwm_timeout is five seconds.  When making
a geometry request to the window manager, the Shell widget will wait
for five seconds for a response.  If a response does not arrive within
five seconds, the Shell widget will
set XmNwaitForWm to False, and assume that the window
manager is not functioning.
The Shell widget will continue without waiting for the
event that would otherwise arrive to report the size of the window, and
also without updating Xt's internal cache of window geometries.  When this
event does arrive later, Xt may set XmNwaitForWm back to
True and update its internal cache.  These
resources should normally be left to their default values.ID="IX-1013-11-65"resourcesXmNgeometry (Shell)The XmNgeometry and XmNiconic resources are intended
to be specified by the user.  Only these two resources use standard

The XmNicon_x and XmNicon_y icon position hints are
best left specified by the user.  Icons' positions are
determined by the window manager based on these hints or on an
icon-positioning policy.  An application with several top-level
windows could set the icon position hints in its app-defaults
file so that the icons for each top-level window appear
side-by-side.We will discuss the remaining resources in related groups.

root window.  These are called top-level windows.  The window manager
directly controls the size and position of the
top-level windows of each application.  The window manager does not
control the geometry of other widgets that are the descendants of
the Shells, except indirectly through the geometry management mechanism
described in Chapter 12, Geometry Management.ID="IX-1013-11-78"hintssizeID="IX-1013-11-79"sizehints
The most basic size hint, the one that specifies simply the desired
initial height and width, is automatically set by Xt based on the
size of the child of the Shell widget.  This hint is used by
most window managers to display the outline of your application when
it first appears on the screen, ready for the user to place and/or
size the application.
If your application does not have specific size needs, you need not
set any additional resources.
ID="IX-1013-11-80"Shell widgetresourcesThe additional size hints specify the application's
range of desired sizes, desired increments of sizes, and
desired range of aspect ratios.  These are set by the
XmNbaseHeight, XmNbaseWidth,
XmNminWidth, XmNminHeight, XmNmaxWidth,
XmNmaxHeight, XmNwidthInc, XmNheightInc,
XmNminAspectX, XmNminAspectY, XmNmaxAspectX,
and XmNmaxAspectY resources.

units of a particular number of pixels.  Window managers that listen for
this hint always resize the window to the base size (for each
dimension), plus or minus an integral multiple of the size increment
hint for that dimension.  If the base size resource
has not been set, the minimum size is used as the base.  For example,
xterm
uses the font width and font height as width and height increment hints,
because it prefers not to have partial characters or dead space
around the edges.  The bitmap editor application described in
Chapter 4, An Example Application, should probably set both the width and height increments to the cell_size_in_pixels, since the bitmap cells are square.ID="IX-1013-11-98"resourcesXmNgeometry (Shell)ID="IX-1013-11-99"options-geometryID="IX-1013-11-100"xterm
Most applications that use size increment hints redefine the
interpretation of geometry specifications (the XmNgeometry
resource, settable through the -geometry standard command-line
option) to reflect the size increments.  For example, the width and
height in xterm geometry specifications are in units of
characters, not pixels.  The Vt100 widget within xterm
implements this by having an XmNgeometry resource separate
from the shell geometry resource with that name.  The entry for this
resource in the widget resource list specifies the Vt100 instance
structure field, not the shell instance structure field.  Then the
realize method for the Vt100 parses the geometry string with
ID="IX-1013-11-101"realize methodXParseGeometry() (an Xlib routine that returns four separate
ID="IX-1013-11-102"XParseGeometry Xlib function
variables containing the size and position from the geometry string)
and sets the width and height fields of the core structure and the
various size hints according to the returned variables.
(The Vt100 within xterm is not a real, self-sufficient widget.
For one thing, it has no set_values method.  For any real
widget to implement this approach to interpreting geometry
specifications, the set_values method would have to multiply
the XmNwidth and XmNheight resource settings by the
increment hints.)
ID="IX-1013-11-103"methodsrealizeID="IX-1013-11-104"methodsrealizeID="IX-1013-11-105"aspect ratioAn aspect ratio is the ratio of the width to height
measurement or vice versa.  The XmNminAspectX and
XmNminAspectY resources are used together to determine one
extreme of acceptable aspect ratios, and XmNmaxAspectX and
XmNmaxAspectY determine the other extreme.  For example, to suggest that
the xmh application never be more than four times larger in one
direction than it is in the other, the following values (as they
would appear in the app-defaults file) would suffice:ID="SC-1013-11-2"xmh*topLevel.minAspectX:    1
xmh*topLevel.minAspectY:    1
xmh*topLevel.maxAspectX:    4
xmh*topLevel.maxAspectY:    4Remember that every application must be able to do something
reasonable given any size for its top-level window, even if the window
is too
small to be useful or if any of these hints are ignored by the
window manager.

delivered to by setting the keyboard focus window (sometimes
called just the keyboard focus) to an application's top-level
window.  The distribution of events according to the current keyboard
focus is handled by the server; it is a basic feature of X, not of Xt.

Some window managers, like twm, use the
pointer-following (also called real-estate-driven) model of keyboard
input; the window containing the
pointer gets the keyboard input.  Setting the keyboard focus once
to the root window implements the pointer-following model.  Other
ID="IX-1013-11-114"root window
window managers use the click-to-type model, exemplified by the
Macintosh‘ user interface,
requiring that the user click the pointer in the window where
keyboard input is to go.  The window manager sets the
keyboard focus to the window the user clicks on.  mwm
lets the user select between these two focus models by setting
a resource.ID="IX-1013-11-115"mwmuse of input hintWith some window managers other than mwm, how the window
manager treats an application window
can be modified by the input model hint,
which is set by the XmNinput resource.
Even though mwm doesn't use the value of this hint, Motif
applications should set it in case they are used under a window
manager that does use the hint.

If XmNinput is set to True,
the window manager will set the keyboard focus to this
application or not, according to its pointer-following or click-to-type model
of keyboard input.  However, if it is set to False, the window
manager will not set the keyboard focus to this application.
If the application sets this resource to False and wants input,
it will have to forcefully take the keyboard focus, and then put it
back to the original window when finished.For historical (not logical) reasons, the Intrinsics default for the
XmNinput resource is False.  However, there is a
special internal Shell widget class called VendorShell, which
sets appropriate resources for a given widget set.  The proper
default for a given widget set (which usually has an accompanying
window manager) is set by that widget set's VendorShell.
The majority of
applications need XmNinput set to True unless they don't
require keyboard input (and expect never to have accelerators).
ID="IX-1013-11-120"VendorShell widgetID="IX-1013-11-121"widgetssets; special defaultsThere are four models of client input handling
defined by the ICCCM:
ID="IX-1013-11-122"keyboardkeyboard focus; stylesID="IX-1013-11-123"window managerkeyboard focusMARK="BULLET"No Input.  The client never expects keyboard input.
xload is an example of such an output-only client.
This type of client sets XmNinput to False.
ID="IX-1013-11-124"xloadPassive Input.
The client expects keyboard input but never explicitly sets the input
focus.  This describes the vast majority of applications that always
accept keyboard input in the window that contains the pointer.
This type of client sets XmNinput to True.Locally Active Input.
The client expects keyboard input, and explicitly sets the keyboard focus,
but only does so when one of its windows already has the focus.
An example would be a client with subwindows defining various data
entry fields that uses Next and Prev keys to move the keyboard focus
between the fields, once its top-level window has received the keyboard focus.
This type of client sets XmNinput to True.ID="IX-1013-11-125"Shell widgetresourcesGlobally Active Input.
The client expects keyboard input, and explicitly sets the input
focus even when the focus is in windows the client does not own.
An example would be a client with a scrollbar that wants to allow
users to scroll the window without disturbing the keyboard focus even if
it is in some other window.  It wants to temporarily set and then reset
the keyboard focus when the user clicks in the scrolled region, but not
when the user clicks in the scrollbar itself.
Thus, it wants to prevent the window
manager from setting the keyboard focus to any of its windows.
This type of client sets XmNinput to False.Note that even if the XmNinput resource is not set to
True, your application will still work under some window
managers, including uwm, twm, and mwm.
This is because these window managers
ID="IX-1013-11-126"mwmkeyboard focus in
use the pointer-following keyboard focus model or
ignore this hint.  However, it is not wise to assume that all window
managers will ignore this hint.  Therefore, if your application expects
keyboard input, and is not of the globally active type described above,
you can use the code shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-11-1"Example 11-1  to set the XmNinput resource.

X allows virtual colormaps to be created by applications.  Some
high-performance systems
even allow all virtual colormaps to be installed in hardware colormaps
and used at the same time, even to the level of one colormap per
window.  Far more commonly, though, there is only one hardware colormap,
and virtual colormaps have to be copied into the hardware
colormap one at a time as needed.
Copying a virtual colormap into the hardware
colormap is called installing the colormap, and the reverse
process where the default colormap is installed is called
uninstalling.
The window manager is responsible
for installing and uninstalling colormaps.
ID="IX-1013-11-137"colormapinstallingID="IX-1013-11-138"window managercolormapsID="IX-1013-11-139"converterscolor name to pixel valueIf your application has standard color needs (decoration only), then
you do not have to worry about the effects of colormaps being
installed and uninstalled.  Your application should use the standard
XmRString to XmRPixel converter to translate color
names into pixel values.  If the colormap is full, or becomes full
at any of the color allocations in the converter, the warning messages
place the burden on the user to kill some applications in order to
free some colormap cells.  (If the converter cannot allocate the
desired color, it prints a warning message, and the default for that
resource is used.  If the default is not XtDefaultForeground
or XtDefaultBackground, it also must be converted and this may
also fail.  If both allocations fail, the color will default to
black.  If this is not acceptable, then you will need to write your
own type converter.)
ID="IX-1013-11-140"XtDefaultForeground constantID="IX-1013-11-141"XtDefaultBackgroundIf your application absolutely requires accurate colors, a certain
number of distinguishable colors, or dynamically changeable colors,
you will need to write your own converter to allocate colors.
For example, if a color allocation for a known correct color name
string fails, it means that all the colormap entries have already been
allocated and no entry for that color is available.  In this case, your
converter might call the Xlib call XCopyColormapAndFree() to
copy the allocations your application has already made into a new
colormap.  Then the converter would allocate the color
(and all subsequent colors) from the new colormap.
ID="IX-1013-11-142"XCopyColormapAndFree Xlib functionSee Chapter 7, Color, in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, for details of various color allocation techniques.The window manager is responsible for installing and uninstalling
colormaps according to its own policy.  Typically, the policy is to
install the colormap of the application that has the keyboard focus
or that contains the pointer.  When an application
has created a new colormap on a system that supports only one hardware
colormap, and that colormap is installed, all applications that were
using the other colormap will be displayed using the new colormap.
Since the pixel values from the old colormap have not been allocated
in the new colormap, all applications that use the old colormap will
be displayed with false colors.  This is known as "going technicolor."ID="IX-1013-11-143"colorfalseThe window manager or some other client 
may also create standard colormaps to facilitate
the sharing of colors between applications.  A standard colormap
is a colormap allocated with a publicly known arrangement of colors.
The Xlib routine XGetStandardColormap() allows an application
to determine whether the window manager has created a specific
standard colormap, and it gets a structure describing the colormap.

manager about this so that these colormaps can be properly installed
when the application is active.  You do this by calling
XtSetWMColormapWindows(), specifying the ApplicationShell widget
as the first argument, a list of widgets that
need certain colormaps as the second argument, and the length of
the list as the third argument.  This instructs the window manager
to read the colormap window attribute of each of the listed
widgets, and to install that colormap in each widget (if possible)
whenever the application is active.
(Of course, any application that depends on the existence of multiple
simultaneous colormaps is doomed to run on only a small percentage of
existing systems.)The colormap window attribute of a window is an unchangeable

characteristic of that window, that is assigned when the window is created
(when the widget is realized).  The Core realize method sets
it based on the XmNcolormap Core resource of the widget.
Therefore, if a widget must have a certain colormap, you must set its
XmNcolormap resource while creating the widget.
Attempting to set XmNcolormap after a widget is created
will have no effect on its colormap window attribute.

Depending on the window manager, these icons may simply contain a
text string called the icon name, or they may contain a pattern that
identifies the application, called the icon pixmap.
The window manager is not obligated to display the
application's icon pixmap (by default, mwm and twm do
not display the icon pixmap).  However, the window manager will
always display at least the icon name.ID="IX-1013-11-152"resourcesXmNiconName (Shell)An application may supply an icon name by setting the
XmNiconName resource; if it does not, the window manager
will usually use the application name or the value of the
XmNtitle resource.

form of a single-plane pixmap, as the XmNiconPixmap resource.
There are two basic ways to do this:  one is by including bitmap data,
and the other is by reading it in at run time.  The former is easy to
do with an Xlib call; the code that needs to be added is shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-11-2"Example 11-2.
The latter technique, because it involves building a filename and looking in a number of locations for
the file, is better done with a converter defined by the Xmu library.
This converter technique is more complicated because the
converter has to be registered and called with the proper arguments.
The example using a converter is provided in the example source code for
this book (xicon2),
but is not shown here.  See Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion, for more information on
invoking converters.

You can create such a file using the bitmap application from
the standard distribution,
or xbitmap5 from the examples for this book.
ID="IX-1013-11-161"bitmapaboutThe window manager may have a preferred standard size for
icons.  If so, it will set a property.  The application can read
this property with the Xlib call XGetIconSizes().
To fully support a variety of window managers, an application should
be capable of creating icon pixmaps of different sizes, depending on
the values returned by XGetIconSizes().An application has the option of creating its own icon window, and
then passing its ID to the window manager for management.
This might be done so that the application can draw a multi-colored
picture in the icon, instead of the traditional two-color bitmap,
or animate the icon.  However, as with all hints, the window manager
is not guaranteed to honor your desires and may just ignore the icon
window you provide.  But if you want to try anyway, create the window
using Xlib calls, and select input on it so that your application
receives Expose events when they occur.  Then set the ID
of the window using the XmNiconWindow resource, before
realizing the application.  Then make sure your event loop
redraws the icon when it receives Expose events on it.
Accomplishing this will require writing your own modified version
of XtAppMainLoop() to handle the icon events.

ID="IX-1013-11-168"Shell widgetresourcesID="IX-1013-11-169"reparentingThe way these decorations are implemented can have an impact on
Toolkit applications.  The window manager places the decorations in a
window slightly bigger than the application, and then reparents
the application's top-level window into the decoration window.
Reparenting gives the top-level window a new parent instead of
the root window.  The window manager
actually creates the frame window as a child of the root window, then
reparents the application's top-level window into the frame, and then
maps the frame window.ID="IX-1013-11-170"positionrelative to root windowID="IX-1013-11-171"root window
Reparenting affects the application mainly when you try to
determine a global position (relative to the root window)
from the XmNx and XmNy resources of the
Shell widget.  This is usually done in order to place popups.  Under a
nonreparenting window manager such as uwm, these
coordinates are indeed relative to the root window, because the
parent of the shell is the root window.  However, under
a window manager that reparents, the coordinates of the application's
main Shell widget are
relative to the decoration window, not the root window.  Therefore,
these coordinates cannot be used for placing popups within the
application.
Motif's internal code that places a popup
uses XtTranslateCoords() instead of relying on the position
resources.ID="S2-1013-11-8"Interacting With the Motif Window ManagerThe application and mwm can
communicate back and forth through properties stored on the server.
The properties are associated with the top-level window of your
application, so unlike selections, similar communications can be
going on at the same time between different clients and the window
manager without interference.
The ICCCM, Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual,
defines a starting point for what information can be sent
back and forth.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-5"ID="FN-1013-11-5"The ICCCM is reprinted as an appendix of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.mwm also defines some other information it
is willing to send and receive.All Shell widgets handle the required communication with the window
manager;  this section concerns optional communication.
Note that applications should not depend on this type of
communication.  An application may run
under a different window manager that doesn't listen to this
type of message.  Furthermore, an application is not required to
use this type of communication, because mwm runs fine without
it.  This type of communication is just icing on the cake.
(If you want to know whether mwm is running anyway, use the
XmIsMotifWMRunning() function.)
ID="IX-1013-11-172"mwminterclient communicationID="IX-1013-11-173"XmIsMotifWMRunning functionThe next three sections describe the two major groups of protocols
and a set of supplementary window manager hints.
The first protocol group is defined by the ICCCM, and the second by
Motif.  You must include the header file <X11/Protocols.h> to use
any of these features.
ID="IX-1013-11-174"Protocols.h header fileBefore you can use these features, you must also prepare the required
atoms.  The type Atom is an ID for the string name for a
property.
All applications know the name of the property they will use for
communication (such as WM_PROTOCOLS), but they don't know the ID for
it since it changes each time the server is run.  You can get the
Atom for a property name by calling XmInternAtom().

All the fully capitalized words used in this section are property

between two clients of the same server.  The most familiar example
of selections is selecting text from one xterm application and
pasting it into another.
This text can also be pasted into an xmh mail
composition window, or into an xedit application.ID="IX-1013-11-205"Text widgetID="IX-1013-11-206"xmhID="IX-1013-11-207"xedit
In Xt applications, selection is normally implemented within widgets.
For example, the Athena Text widget is used by xmh and
xedit, and it is this widget that supports cutting and pasting
of text in these applications.  The application code of xmh and
xedit does not
play a part in the communication of selection data.  The fact that
selection is implemented in widgets also means that two widgets within
the same application can communicate with each other through
selections.  For example, the Text widget is sometimes used to
provide single-line input fields in an application.  Since the Text
widget supports selections, the user could select the text in one
field and paste it into another field.  This feature would be present
without any code in the application.
If the same widget class supports both copying and pasting,
selections can be used to move data in a single widget.  For example,
selections allow you to copy text within an editor in xterm and
paste the text in a new place (although some editors require keyboard
commands to position the insertion point).
ID="IX-1013-11-208"single-line input fieldMotif provides a high-level interface to the selection mechanism that
allows Motif applications or widgets to easily transfer data.
See LINKEND="S1-1013-11-3"Section 11.3, "Motif Cut and Paste Functions and the Clipboard" for a description of this interface.
The basic selection mechanism described in this section is valid for
all widget sets, not just Motif.The selection mechanism is not limited to text.  It requires only
that the sender and recipient have knowledge of the format of the
data being transferred.  Therefore, selections can be used to
transfer graphics between widgets that can understand a common format
for communicating graphics.  Unfortunately, a standard format for
graphics selections
has not yet been agreed upon.ID="IX-1013-11-209"propertiesaboutID="IX-1013-11-210"selectionsSelectionClear eventID="IX-1013-11-211"eventsSelectionClearID="IX-1013-11-212"selectionsSelectionNotify eventID="IX-1013-11-213"eventsSelectionNotifyID="IX-1013-11-214"selectionsSelectionRequest eventID="IX-1013-11-215"eventsSelectionRequest
The selection mechanism
uses properties for transferring data and uses the
SelectionClear, SelectionNotify, and
SelectionRequest event types to synchronize the communication.
Essentially, a property is common storage.
Properties are stored in the server, and are named pieces of data
associated with a window on that particular server,
that any client of that server can read or write.
Because the various clients may not be running on the same host,
all communication between applications and between applications and
the window manager must take place through the server using properties.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-6"ID="FN-1013-11-6"ID="IX-1013-11-216"TCP/IPID="IX-1013-11-217"DECnetID="IX-1013-11-218"XX Protocol
It is not practical to write your own networking
routines in an application to communicate with other clients running
on different hosts because your client may be communicating with the
server using TCP/IP, and the other client may be using DECnet.  Both
may be the same X application that you wrote, but compiled with a
version of Xlib that uses a different protocol layer
underneath the X Protocol.  When you communicate through the server
using properties, the server takes care of the translation.The basic routines used to implement selections are part of Xlib.
Xt provides an interface to the Xlib selection routines that
makes selections easier to use in the context of widget code.
Since there is a maximum size for the data stored in a single
property, communication of large blocks of data using Xlib requires
several partial transfers.  Xt supplies routines that
transparently perform the multiple partial transfers so that they
appear to the application program like a single transfer, called
an atomic transfer.Xt also supplies a separate set of parallel routines that
transfer a large selection one chunk at a time so that it appears
as multiple small selections.  This is called an incremental
transfer.  Incremental transfer can be preferable on systems with
limited memory and more natural when the data is normally stored in
small chunks.The Toolkit selection routines also have built-in timeouts, so
that one application won't wait forever for another to provide data.First we'll give you an overview of how an atomic selection transaction
works, and then we'll discuss and demonstrate how to write the code
to implement atomic selections in a widget.  Following this is
a discussion of how incremental selections work, and finally a
discussion of the standard selection formats (known as target types).ID="IX-1013-11-219"cut and pasteselectionsIf you are writing a custom widget that contains data that
could be pasted into other instances of the widget or other widgets,
you should read on to see how to implement selections.  Otherwise, the
rest of this chapter is probably only of academic interest to you.ID="S2-1013-11-9"How Atomic Selection WorksSelections communicate between an owner widget and a
requestor widget.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-7"ID="FN-1013-11-7"Note that since selections can be implemented in the application,
as they are by non-Xt applications, the words "application" and
"widget" are interchangeable in this section.
The owner has the data
and the requestor wants it.  The owner is the widget in which the user
has selected something, and the requestor is the widget in which the
user has clicked to paste that something.  Many widgets need to act
as both owner and requester at different times.
The code to handle each of the two roles is separate.Here is a brief overview of the steps that take place during a single
transfer of data from one widget to another.
We'll assume we have two instances of the same widget class,
which can operate either as the owner or the requestor.
Initially, both widgets are in exactly the same state, neither having
any text selected, and neither being the owner or requestor.
We'll also assume that selections are implemented using actions
tied to pointer buttons, as in existing widgets that use
selections.MARK="BULLET"The user selects an item in Widget A, and the widget highlights the
item.  An action, typically called in response to
a <Btn1Down> translation, marks the start of a selection.  A subsequent
<Btn1Motion> event (that is, a motion event with button 1 held
down) invokes another action to extend the highlighted selection.ID="IX-1013-11-220"PRIMARY selectionID="IX-1013-11-221"selectionsXA_PRIMARYID="IX-1013-11-222"XA_PRIMARY atomID="IX-1013-11-223"XtOwnSelection
A <Btn1Up> event invokes a third action in Widget A
that actually makes the selection.  The action calls XtOwnSelection()
to claim ownership of the PRIMARY selection for Widget A.
This means that Widget A claims the sole right to use the XA_PRIMARY
property for communication with other widgets, until some other widget claims
ownership.  (More about XA_PRIMARY below.)
The call to XtOwnSelection() also registers three procedures,
to be called by Xt in response to selection
events.  The lose_ownership_proc handles the case
where Widget A loses the selection (because the user has made
another selection elsewhere),
the convert_proc converts the data in the selection
to the target property type
requested by Widget B (see below), and the optional
transfer_done_proc prepares for the next selection request, if
necessary (this function is often NULL).The user pastes the item into Widget B, usually by clicking a pointer
button.  (By convention, a translation for <Btn2Down> invokes the
action to do this.)The paste action in Widget B requests the value of the current selection
by calling XtGetSelectionValue(); this specifies a target type,
and a requestor_callback
that will be invoked to actually paste the data when Widget
A reports that the conversion has been successfully completed.ID="IX-1013-11-224"XtGetSelectionValuesID="IX-1013-11-225"eventsSelectionRequest
The XtGetSelectionValue() call by Widget B also generates a
SelectionRequest event.  In response to this event, Xt invokes the
convert_proc registered by the call to
XtOwnSelection() in Widget A.ID="IX-1013-11-226"XtConvertSelectionProcThe convert_proc
in Widget A converts the selected item into
the appropriate data type for the target property specified by B, if possible.
The converted data is stored in the XA_PRIMARY property.Based on the return values from Widget A's conversion procedure,
Xt sends a SelectionNotify event to
inform Widget B whether or not the data was successfully
converted.ID="IX-1013-11-227"XtSelectionCallbackProcThe requestor_callback registered in
Widget B reads the data from the property and displays it, or if
Widget A reported that the conversion could not be made, Widget B
beeps or otherwise indicates that the kind of data
selected in Widget A cannot be pasted in Widget B, or that the kind
of data requested by B cannot be supplied by A.ID="IX-1013-11-228"XtSelectionDoneProcXt notifies Widget A that the selection has been transferred,
so that the widget's transfer_done_proc can disown
the selection if the selection
is of a kind that can be transferred only once.LINKEND="FG-1013-11-1"Figure 11-1 shows this procedure in graphic form.The code to implement selections is divided logically into a number of functions within the widget.  The next sections show the code necessary
to implement both the owner and the requestor roles.
The code for each role is separate and
cannot share any widget variables with the other role because
the transaction may be between two different widget instances.As an example, we will add support for selections to the BitmapEdit widget
described in Chapter 6, Inside a Widget, and Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods.  Little of the existing code in that widget needs to be changed.
The examples show only the code added to implement selections,
and describe where to add it.We will start with the owner role, and then proceed to the
requestor role, and then back to the owner role.ID="FG-1013-11-1"The process of selection transferFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="11.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-11-2"ID="S2-1013-11-10"Highlighting the Selected Data (Owner)ID="IX-1013-11-229"selectionshighlightingThe selection process begins when the user selects some
text in Widget A.  The widget code for the owner role must contain some
code to identify the area or items selected and to highlight the text (or
whatever) being selected.
This user-interface portion of the owner role is carried out by
actions added to the widget.  Some event sequences that are not
already in use must be mapped to these actions.  In existing
applications that support selections of text:MARK="BULLET"A press of the first pointer button
pins a starting point of the selection, dragging the first
button extends and highlights the selection,
and releasing the first button ends the selection.
A subsequent press of the first button starts a new selection,
unhighlighting the old one.A press of the second button pastes the selection.A button press or
motion with the third button depressed repositions either
end of the selected area.It is a good idea to stick
with existing conventions for the user interface of highlighting
a selection, so that your application will operate in a familiar way.
But since BitmapEdit already uses all three pointer buttons, unmodified,
to set, unset, and toggle bitmap cells, we cannot use unmodified
button presses to control selections.  But we can (and will) use
these same buttons modified by Shift.A selection in BitmapEdit is any rectangular set of bitmap
cells.  Accordingly,
BitmapEdit will use Shift<Btn1Down> to set the top-left corner of a
selection rectangle, Shift<Btn1Motion> to follow dragging, and
Shift<Btn1Up> to set the bottom right corner.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-8"
Each of these
events will invoke a separate action routine, StartHighlight,
ExtendHighlight, and MakeSelection, respectively.
These translations are added to the widget's default translation
table, and the actions are added to the actions table.

LINKEND="EX-1013-11-3"Example 11-3 reference some new instance part fields we have added to BitmapEditP.h to store the state of the selection.  Four
of these variables are the x and y coordinates in cells of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the highlighted area:
select_start_x, select_start_y, select_end_x,
and select_end_y.  These coordinates will be used throughout
the owner code.  (Because these fields are in units of bitmap cells,
not pixels, their type is int rather than Position.)The StartHighlight action is quite simple.  It
sets the upper-left corner instance part fields based on the
button press position in the triggering event.  It also clears
the highlighting of the old selection, if one exists,
and sets a flag to indicate that this is the
beginning of a new selection.  The first_box flag is added as
an instance part field because it will be needed in the
ExtendHighlight action.ID="IX-1013-11-234"rubber-band outlineID="IX-1013-11-235"graphics contextsexclusive or logical functionExtendHighlight is responsible for drawing Xs dynamically
on the selected cells, much as
the window manager draws the outline of a window while it is
being moved.  Xs are drawn on each cell in a rectangle of bitmap cells
beginning from the cell selected in the StartHighlight action
and ending at the cell the pointer button was released in.
ExtendHighlight is triggered by pointer motion
events that occur while the first button is held down.  It
calculates which bitmap cell the pointer is in, and if the cell
is not the same as the cell the pointer was in the last time
ExtendHighlight was called, it erases the previous Xs
and draws new ones.  This is done using two different GCs--one
for drawing in black and the other in white, so the color
that contrasts with the current state of each cell can be used.
The black GC is also used to copy the main pixmap to the screen, and
the latter is just for doing the highlighting.Code was added to the initialize method to create this latter
GC.  (See  the example code distribution for this modified
widget instance structure.)

bottom-right corner of the selection, and then swaps the
top-left and bottom-right coordinates if the end coordinate is
to the left or above the start coordinate.  If the start and end
coordinates are the same, then the action returns, since no selection
was made.  If a selection was made,
MakeSelection calls XtOwnSelection().

communication with the server, a property is never referenced by
name, but by a unique integer ID called an atom.  Standard atoms
are defined in <Xatom.h> using defined symbols beginning
with XA_; nonstandard atoms can be obtained
from the server by calling the Xlib function
XtInternAtom.

Widgets that support one selection at a time pass the predefined
XA_PRIMARY atom to XtOwnSelection().  The ICCCM also
allows you to use  the XA_SECONDARY and XA_CLIPBOARD
atoms.  XA_SECONDARY would be used by widgets implementing
behavior involving more than one selection (for example, allowing
the user to make two selections, and to exchange the data they
contain).  No current clients implement this behavior.
The XA_CLIPBOARD atom should be used by a widget that allows the
user to delete a selection.  We'll talk more about the
properties referenced by the XA_SECONDARY 
and XA_CLIPBOARD atoms in LINKEND="S1-1013-11-3"Section 11.3, "Motif Cut and Paste Functions and the Clipboard."ID="IX-1013-11-254"XtOwnSelectionThe purpose of the
XtOwnSelection() call is to make sure that only one widget has
the right to set the XA_PRIMARY selection property at a time, and
to assert that this widget is prepared to honor requests for this data.
Notice that when you select text with xterm, that text
is highlighted only until you select a different area in a different
window.
ID="IX-1013-11-255"selectionsasserting ownershipThe next three arguments to XtOwnSelection() specify
procedures that will carry out essential parts of the selection
operation:MARK="BULLET"The convert_proc is responsible for converting the
selected data into the representation requested by the requestor in
its call to XtGetSelectionValue();  this function is called by
Xt when a SelectionRequest event arrives,  as a result of the
requestor calling XtGetSelectionValue().  The convert_proc
is of type XtConvertSelectionProc.
ID="IX-1013-11-256"XtGetSelectionValuesID="IX-1013-11-257"XtConvertSelectionProcThe lose_ownership_proc clears the highlighted area
when this widget has lost the selection (because some other widget has
taken it); this routine is called by Xt when a
SelectionClear event arrives.
The lose_ownership_proc is
of type XtLoseSelectionProc.
ID="IX-1013-11-258"XtLoseSelectionProcID="IX-1013-11-259"eventsSelectionClearThe transfer_done_proc is called by Xt when the
requestor has successfully retrieved the converted value.
If this selection is intended to be erased after being transferred
once, this function should free any storage allocated in the
transfer.  If, instead, the owner remains ready for
pasting the same selection into other widgets,
this function pointer should be NULL.
(For example, xterm does not clear its selection after pasting
once.)  The transfer_done_proc is of type XtSelectionDoneProc.ID="IX-1013-11-260"selectionslosing selectionID="IX-1013-11-261"selectionsand CurrentTimeThe XtOwnSelection() call also takes a time argument--this
should be the time from the event that completed the highlighting,
not the constant CurrentTime.
If XtOwnSelection() returns False, it means that because
of network conditions another client has called
XtOwnSelection() with a more recent time argument.XtOwnSelection() returns True or False to indicate
whether Widget A has been granted ownership.  If True, and if
this widget was not already the owner, then the
old owner (if any) will receive a SelectionClear event
and will clear its highlighted area.
The process may end here if the user never pastes the selected data
anywhere.  If the user selects a different piece of data, the
selection owner will receive a SelectionClear itself before
ever having converted the data for a requestor.Otherwise the owner code waits to hear from the requestor that it
is ready to paste the selection.

becomes the requestor and the second part of the process begins.
First of all, Widget B needs a translation that maps a certain key
or button event to an action that pastes data.  This action
calls XtGetSelectionValue().
ID="IX-1013-11-265"XtGetSelectionValuesXtGetSelectionValue() is called with six arguments:ID="SC-1013-11-4"    void XtGetSelectionValue (widget, selection, target, callback,

    Widget widget;
    Atom selection;
    Atom target;
    XtSelectionCallbackProc callback;
    XtPointer client_data;
    Time time;The selection argument is an atom specifying which
property is being used to transfer the selection.  This will typically be
XA_PRIMARY, though in theory two widgets (or two
instances of the same widget) could agree to transfer some
particular data using other properties.The target argument is another atom, this one specifying
a target representation type in which the requestor wants the information.
We'll talk more about the possible values for this atom in a moment.The callback argument is a pointer to
a callback procedure that actually pastes the data.  Xt will call
this procedure when the owner has converted the data.  The
XtGetSelectionValue() call registers the callback with Xt, and
sends a SelectionRequest event to the owner.
ID="IX-1013-11-266"selectionsrequestingID="IX-1013-11-267"eventsSelectionRequestID="IX-1013-11-268"eventsSelectionNotifyWhen the selection owner
has successfully converted the data, the owner sends back a
SelectionNotify event to Xt.  Xt then calls the requestor's
callback procedure.  The callback procedure must handle the pasting of
the data into the widget's data structures, and it must handle the
case where the data could not be converted into the requested
representation.  We'll discuss the responsibilities of this
procedure in more detail once we've seen the owner's conversion
procedure.The client_data argument of XGetSelectionValue() is
normally used to pass the event that triggered the pasting into the
requestor callback.  The callback will use the coordinates at
which the event occurred as the location at which to
paste the data.ID="IX-1013-11-269"XtGetSelectionValuesID="IX-1013-11-270"selectionsrequesting
As in the call to XtOwnSelection(), the time argument
should be the time from the event that initiated the pasting,
not the constant CurrentTime.ID="S3-1013-11-4"Possible Target Type AtomsID="IX-1013-11-271"selectionstarget typesThe target argument to XtGetSelectionValue() is an
atom that the requestor uses to tell the owner what kind of
information it is looking for from the selection.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-9"This is not
necessarily a conversion of the actual selection data.  For
example, it might be a timestamp on the data, or some
characteristic of it, such as its size or font.To take full advantage of the Xt selection mechanism, you need to
understand what atoms can be used as selection targets.
ID="FN-1013-11-9"As described earlier, atoms (rather than strings) are always used in 
network transmissions to identify properties.
However, apart from some standard,
predefined atoms, the atom for a property is not
known by a client until it queries the server for the atom using an
XInternAtom() call.  This call specifies the string name of
the property and returns the atom.
ID="IX-1013-11-272"XInternAtom Xlib functionID="IX-1013-11-273"Xatom.h fileSome atoms needed by almost all applications are predefined in
the header file <X11/Xatom.h>.  These atoms are symbolic
constants that can be used without an XInternAtom() call.
The constants always start with the prefix XA_.  See
<X11/Xatom.h> for the complete list of predefined atoms.
ID="IX-1013-11-274"atomspredefinedNote that many of the predefined atoms have uses in X other than
as target types, and not all
are appropriate as selection targets.
A few of those that might be useful as targets include:ID="SC-1013-11-5"XA_STRING
XA_INTEGER
XA_BITMAPID="IX-1013-11-275"selectionstarget typesAt present, the Athena widgets and the clients in the MIT
core X distribution use only XA_STRING as a target.
However, one can imagine uses for other targets as well.  For
example, XA_FONT might be used as a target to indicate that
the requestor doesn't want the text of a selection, but
wants only to know its font.  XA_TIMESTAMP might be used to
indicate that the requestor wants a timestamp for the data.
ID="IX-1013-11-276"XtGetSelectionValuesID="IX-1013-11-277"eventsSelectionRequest
Once the XtGetSelectionValue() request is made, a
SelectionRequest event is generated, which Xt uses to
invoke the owner widget's convert_proc.
The convert_proc will need to branch according to
the target type passed in by the requestor through Xt, and
convert the data accordingly before transferring the selection to
the requestor.For selection of multiple data types to work correctly between any
two arbitrarily chosen
widgets, there must be conventions about which targets will be
supported.
ID="IX-1013-11-278"selectionstarget typesID="IX-1013-11-279"ICCCMID="IX-1013-11-280"selectionsXA_TARGETSID="IX-1013-11-281"XA_TARGETS atomselections
As a step in the direction of interwidget selection
compatibility,
the ICCCM specifies a required target type of
XA_TARGETS, to which the owner is supposed to respond by returning
a list of the target types into which it is capable of converting data.
We'll talk about how to work with this target in LINKEND="S2-1013-11-17"Section 11.2.9, "ICCCM Compliance."In a custom widget such as BitmapEdit, which has a custom data
type not represented by a predefined atom, it is possible to obtain a
custom atom using XInternAtom(), and use that as the
target.  Because the XInternAtom() call requires a round
trip to the server, the best place to do this is in the widget's
initialize method.LINKEND="FN-1013-11-10"ID="IX-1013-11-282"initialize methodID="IX-1013-11-283"XInternAtom Xlib functionID="IX-1013-11-284"selectionstarget typesID="FN-1013-11-10"Since Xlib functions causing round-trip requests can impact
performance, they should
be called only once if possible, and where possible, during
the set-up phase of the application as opposed to the event-loop
phase.  If XInternAtom()
were called every time the user made a selection,
it would slow the application.  In addition, since atoms are
server resources that are not freed until the server shuts down,
it is important to use predefined atoms whenever possible.
The returned atom can be stored in a field added to the widget's
instance part.  BitmapEdit's target type, "CELL_ARRAY,"is unique to BitmapEdit.  The atom is
stored in an instance part field called target so that it
is available in convert_proc and in the requestor role code.

indicates what to do if the atom doesn't already exist. If this
argument is True, XInternAtom() will return None
if no other client has already initialized this atom.
This argument should always be False since your widget might
be the first to try to make a selection using this target type
atom.  In a Motif application, one could use XmInternAtom()
instead of XInternAtom().Note that for repeated calls to XInternAtom() with the
same string as an argument, even from different widgets, the
returned atom will be the same.  There will be only one atom
created for any unique string interned on a given server.  (Case
is important:  "Cell_Array" would return a different atom than
"CELL_ARRAY".)This XInternAtom() call occurs in every instance of the
BitmapEdit widget, since all instances need to know the atom
to participate in selections using that target type.  Both the
owner and requestor widgets, in separate applications, will get
the same atom in return.

event sequence to trigger the pasting, write an action that
calls XtGetSelectionValue(), and write a callback function that
inserts the returned data.Traditionally, the action to paste data is triggered by a press of
the second pointer button.  BitmapEdit will use
the shifted second button since it uses the unshifted button for
other purposes.

convert_proc, which
converts data to the format specified by the requestor and prepares
it for transfer.As mentioned above, the widget's convert_proc
is called by Xt when the
requestor calls XtGetSelectionValue().
The procedure is passed the selection atom and the target atom, and is
expected to return in its arguments the type, value, size, and format of the
converted selection data.To support the possibility of having to convert the data to any
one of several targets, the code branches according to the value
of the target passed in, and does its conversions accordingly.
In the version of BitmapEdit's convert_proc shown here,
only one target type is handled.  LINKEND="S2-1013-11-17"Section 11.2.9, "ICCCM Compliance" describes how
to add more target types, including some that are required by the
ICCCM such as TARGETS.Once the conversion is made, the procedure sets
the value_return argument passed in
to a pointer to a block of memory, and
length_return to the size of the block.  This
block of memory will be set into a property by Xt and passed to
the requestor's callback in the same form--as a pointer to
a block of memory and a length.  This puts constraints on the formats
that can be used for the data.For text selections, the data is usually a simple character string.
The convert_proc simply needs to set *value_return to
a pointer to the string, and length_return to the length of
the string.  For BitmapEdit, however, the required data is a string
(of bitmap cell states)
plus width and height values.
Since C provides easy ways to put numeric
values into strings and to get them out again at the other end,
we've chosen to handle this
data by converting the numbers to characters and tacking them on
to the beginning of the string.If your selection is composed of a number of numeric values, you can
create a structure containing the values and then pass a pointer to the
structure.  However, the structure cannot contain pointers, because
the data pointed to by these pointers will not be set into the
selection property.  For example, BitmapEdit cannot pass a pointer to a
structure containing a string pointer field and width and height fields
because the block of memory pointed to by the string pointer
will not be copied.In this case,
the type_return can simply be the target atom that was
passed in, indicating that the data is of the requested type.The format_return is the size in bits of each element in the
array.  Since we are passing a compound string, this value is
8.
If we were passing a structure, length_return would be 1
and *format_return would be 8 times the size of the structure
in bytes.LINKEND="EX-1013-11-6"Example 11-6  shows BitmapEdit's convert_proc.

was a success by checking the value and data length.
If it was not, it beeps and prints a message.
This can happen if no selection has been made, or if there is some
delay that causes the selection to have timed out before the owner
could convert the data.If the conversion was a success, the requestor_callback
pastes the data.
In BitmapEdit's case,
the requestor must first convert the data into a more useful form.
This means extracting the width and height
values, and then setting the widget's cell array based on the
data in the character array passed in.  Note that the code should
check to make sure that the data can be pasted in the desired position.
BitmapEdit must make sure that no attempt is
made to set a cell array member outside of the bitmap.
The routine then updates the screen display of the widget.The final responsibility of the requestor_callback is to
free the memory passed in by Xt.

XA_TARGETS, to which the owner is required to respond by returning
a list of the target types into which it is capable of converting data.ID="IX-1013-11-307"XtGetSelectionValuesNormally, a requestor would first call
XtGetSelectionValue() for XA_TARGETS, and then in the

ways when there are workarounds, as in this case.
To use it, you must use
the Xmu atom caching mechanism described in LINKEND="S3-1013-11-6"Section 11.2.9.1, "Xmu Atom Caching."Fortunately, there is existing template code that you can copy to

This template code uses the
Xmu routine XmuConvertStandardSelection.
It also uses an Xmu atom-caching facility that eliminates the
need for you to make XInternAtom() calls for each of the ICCCM
standard target atoms.
ID="IX-1013-11-311"atomsstandardID="S3-1013-11-6"Xmu Atom CachingID="IX-1013-11-312"cachingstandard atomsIn a Motif application, you can use XmInternAtom() to
cache atoms, so that when there are multiple instances of the same
widget, only one query of the server will be done.  However,
Xmu provides an atom caching system that is somewhat more
convenient for the atoms it supports.Xmu's caching facility uses symbols similar to those defined in
<X11/Xatom.h>, except that in this case they are macros that take an argument and call XmuInternAtom.
ID="IX-1013-11-313"Xmu libraryXmuInternAtom
For example, the macro for XA_TARGETS is defined as follows in
<X11/Xmu.h>:ID="SC-1013-11-6"#define XA_TARGETS(d)        XmuInternAtom(d, _XA_TARGETS)where d refers to a pointer to a Display
structure. (This can be returned by the XtDisplay()
macro.)
ID="IX-1013-11-314"Xmu libraryXmuInternAtom
The XmuInternAtom function first tries to get the
atom for the string "XA_TARGETS" from Xmu's internal cache.  If
Xmu doesn't yet have a value for the atom, it calls XInternAtom()
to make a server request.  Because this facility makes only one
query to the server, you can access the atoms in this way
every time a selection is made without significant penalty.
This allows you to place the XA_TARGETS() macro in your
selection code instead of adding an instance part variable and
setting it in the initialize method.You might use this macro as follows in a convert_proc
branch dedicated to handling the TARGETS target type:

The ICCCM also specifies that functions implementing selections
must be able to respond to a MULTIPLE target value, which is used
to handle selections too large to fit into a single property.
However, the necessary handling is done by the Intrinsics.
Your procedures do not need to worry about responding to the
MULTIPLE
target value; a selection request with this target type will be
transparently transformed into a series of
smaller transfers.In the first branch you will also need to change the
reference to the instance part field that stores the target
atom used for selections, bitmapEdit.target_atom.
If your widget uses a predefined atom or one
supported by the Xmu facility, you would reference that atom here
instead of the instance part field.  If you called XInternAtom()

you specify that here.ID="IX-1013-11-333"XtGetSelectionRequestNote that XtGetSelectionRequest() is used to get the time
from the SelectionRequest event that the owner received

XtGetSelectionRequest() was introduced in R4 for this
specific reason; it needs to meet the current ICCCM and work around the fact that the convert_proc is defined without an event argument.
(The convert_proc definition could not be changed because
of the required backwards compatibility with R3.)

except that you use different set of routines and procedure types,
and Xt calls the procedures you register multiple times instead
of just once as in atomic transfers.  Incremental transfers and
atomic transfers are mutually exclusive--an owner can support
both, but if the owner doesn't, a requestor cannot use the
incremental routines to request a selection owned atomically, or
vice versa.As in an atomic transfer, the owner and the requestor in an incremental transfer only have to make one call each in order to initiate this
multiple-section transfer.
Here is the procedure:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-11-338"XtOwnSelectionIncrementalThe owner calls XtOwnSelectionIncremental() in response
to the user selecting something.  XtOwnSelectionIncremental()
returns True or False to indicate whether ownership
was granted.  XtOwnSelectionIncremental() registers four callbacks:ID="SC-1013-11-8"XtConvertSelectionIncrProcconvert_proc;

to request the selection with XtGetSelectionValueIncremental().
XtGetSelectionValueIncremental() registers one callback:
ID="IX-1013-11-343"XtGetSelectionValueIncrementalID="SC-1013-11-9"XtSelectionCallbackProcrequestor_proc;
ID="IX-1013-11-344"XtSelectionCallbackProcThis callback receives the selection data.
The requestor_proc is called once upon delivery of
each segment of the selection value.
It is called with type XT_CONVERT_FAIL when the transfer is
aborted--the requestor has the option of keeping or disposing of the
partial selection.  XtGetSelectionValuesIncremental() is
analogous except that it accepts multiple target/client_data pairs
which must be received in the requestor_proc.The request for the selection causes Xt to call the
convert_proc, which supplies the selection as
described for atomic transfers, with the following exceptions.
First, convert_proc is called repeatedly by Xt to get
each segment.  Therefore, it must keep track of what segments have
been delivered.
Second, when the last segment has been delivered, it should store
a non-NULL value in value and zero in length_return.
Third, the convert_proc must be ready to supply
an additional requestor while it is still engaged in transferring
segments to one requestor.  The convert_proc is called
with a request_id argument that identifies the request.
You write the convert_proc to maintain a record of
which segments have been delivered for each request_id.
One easy way to do this is to use the Xlib context manager.When each segment is converted, Xt calls the
requestor_proc (once for each segment), which extracts
the data for the requestor and actually pastes it.  This function
may paste the data chunk-by-chunk or wait until the entire
transfer is complete and then paste the entire selection.A zero-length segment terminates the transfer and results in Xt
calling the transfer_done_proc.This was the process of a successful transfer.  All the remaining
callback functions registered are for less common occurrences or
unsuccessful transfers.
The cancel_callback is called by Xt on timeout.
This means that the transfer is considered complete even though it
failed.  In this process the owner frees memory allocated for the
transfer.Calls of the lose_ownership_proc do not indicate completion
of in-progress transfers--these transfers should continue.  It just
means that the owner lost ownership of the selection, so that the
owner should unhighlight what the user selected.If transfer_done_proc is specified, the owner allocates and
frees storage.  If transfer_done_proc is NULL,
convert_proc must allocate storage using
XtMalloc(), XtCalloc() or XtRealloc(), but Xt
will free that memory.
ID="IX-1013-11-345"XtDisownSelection
The owner may use XtDisownSelection() to relinquish ownership.
(This is the same routine used to relinquish ownership of an atomic
selection.)ID="S2-1013-11-19"Miscellaneous Selection RoutinesID="IX-1013-11-346"XtDisownSelectionID="IX-1013-11-347"selectionsdisowningIf the user deletes the information selected, the owner should call

ID="IX-1013-11-348"XtSetSelectionTimeoutID="IX-1013-11-349"selectionstimeoutID="IX-1013-11-350"XtGetSelectionTimeoutXtSetSelectionTimeout() sets the time in which widgets must
respond to one another.  This is initially set by
the XmNselectionTimeout resource, and defaults to 5 seconds.  The
selection timeout prevents hanging when the user pastes but the current
owner is slow or hung.  XtGetSelectionTimeout() reads the current
selection timeout value.  Widgets should not normally require these two
calls, since the selection timeout should remain under the user's control.If the requestor can request more than one target type, such as
TARGETS and its normal selection target, it normally does so using
separate actions.  (Both actions can be invoked by the same
triggering event, if desired.)
Each action specifies a different target type and
a different requestor callback.  That way, each requestor callback
handles only one type of target.Beware:  there is a danger in this approach.
The selection owner might change between the
repeated XtGetSelectionValue() calls.
ID="IX-1013-11-351"XtGetSelectionValuesXtGetSelectionValues() (plural) can be used instead if
the requestor would like to receive the data in more than one representation.
The requestor's single callback function would then be called once for each
representation.  (The owner's convert_proc would also be called
once per representation.)ID="S1-1013-11-3"Motif Cut and Paste Functions and the ClipboardID="IX-1013-11-352" SPAN="START"clipboard functionsYou've seen that Xt provides an underlying mechanism called selections
that can transfer data from one widget instance to another, whether or
not the instances are in the same application.  The communication
occurs through the server, using properties.  Most widgets that
display text already support selections.You can also use selections in your application code to transfer
data to other instances of your application or to or from any other
widget or application that understands the format of the data.
However, selections are quite cumbersome to implement.Motif provides some easier-to-use functions that pass data
to and from the clipboard.  The clipboard is
actually a property stored in the server, so that any client can
read or write it.  The clipboard can only hold one piece of data
at a time.Passing a large amount of data can take a few seconds.
Therefore, the clipboard is set up so that the application does not
actually pass data to the clipboard until the data has been
requested by some other application or widget.
Your application makes data available by
registering a function that supplies the data, and Xt
calls that function when the data is requested.
Thus if there is any delay in sending the data, it occurs when the
data is pasted, not when it is cut.Motif provides about 15 functions that read and write this data.
To copy data to the clipboard, you use the sequence of functions
XmClipboardStartCopy(), XmClipboardCopy(), and
XmClipboardEndCopy().  To retrieve data from the clipboard,
you use XmClipboardInquireLength() and
XmClipboardRetrieve().
ID="IX-1013-11-353"selectionsCLIPBOARDID="IX-1013-11-354"xclipboardAccording to the ICCCM, if a widget or application allows the
user to delete a selection, the selection owner code
should place the deleted data on the CLIPBOARD selection.
Since the CLIPBOARD selection is a list of selections, the most
recent deletion should be pushed onto the stack of existing
selections.The standard X distribution includes a special client,
xclipboard, that shows the current value of the CLIPBOARD
property, and allows it to be manipulated.
Except when a widget asserts ownership of the CLIPBOARD with
XtOwnSelection() in order to place newly deleted data on
it, the xclipboard client is the owner of this property.
When it starts up, xclipboard asserts ownership of the
CLIPBOARD selection.  If it loses the selection (which will
happen whenever a widget or client has newly deleted the contents
of a selection), it obtains the contents of the selection from
the new owner, then reasserts its own ownership of the selection.Clients wishing to restore deleted data should request the
contents of the CLIPBOARD, using the same techniques as we've
shown for the PRIMARY selection.  xclipboard will respond
to these requests, returning the deleted data.ID="IX-1013-11-355"selectionsXA_CLIPBOARDID="IX-1013-11-356"xclipboard
The use of xclipboard allows the value of a selection to
survive the termination of the original selection owner.

demonstrated how you can use existing composite widgets such as
RowColumn and constraint widgets such as Form in the application.
You can control widget
layout rules with resources.  However, you may find that no
existing composite or constraint widget can be configured with
resources to have the layout rules you need.  In this case, you will
need to write your own composite or constraint widget or modify an
existing one.  However, before embarking on writing one of these
widgets, you should realize that composite and constraint widgets
are complex.  First investigate the
alternatives!  Perhaps you can find a composite or constraint widget
from another widget set that has the layout characteristics you need.
If you determine that you have no alternative but to write your
own composite or constraint widget, you should keep it as simple as
possible.  It is much easier to write a special-purpose widget that
handles a limited layout situation than it is to write a
general-purpose composite or constraint widget like RowColumn or Form.ID="IX-1013-12-7"composite widgetsaboutID="IX-1013-12-8"composite widgetsabout
A composite widget is defined as any widget that is a subclass
of the Xt-defined class Composite.  A constraint widget is
any widget that is a subclass of the Xt-defined class Constraint.
Constraint is a subclass of Composite.
As you may recall, a composite widget is the simplest kind of geometry-managing widget; it handles all its children equally, or handles each
child in a fixed way.  For example, the RowColumn widget handles all of
its children equally.  As an example of a special-purpose composite
widget, LINKEND="S1-1013-12-2"Section 12.2, "Writing a Composite Widget" describes a composite widget called ScrollBox
that manages two scrollbars and a main window.  This widget requires
that it have exactly three children added in a particular order.ID="IX-1013-12-9"constraint widgetsaboutA constraint
widget has all the characteristics of composite widgets but maintains
configurable data about each child so that it can cater to the needs of
each child.  By setting the constraint resources of a child of
a constraint widget, you configure the constraint widget's layout
policy for that child.  Constraint widgets are inherently more
powerful than composite widgets, but are also more complicated to
write. A constraint widget requires all the code of a composite
widget, plus code to handle the constraints of each child.  Because
of this
complexity, you should hesitate even further before attempting
to write a constraint widget.  As an example of the code for a
constraint widget,
this section describes the Athena Form widget.
(The Motif Form widget is too complex to be described here.)ID="IX-1013-12-10"composite widgetsusing within other widgetsComposite and constraint widgets can be used within widgets as well
as within applications.  For example, you may recall that the
xbitmap
application was implemented using the BitmapEdit widget that appeared
inside a ScrolledWindow or MainWindow widget that in turn added scrollbars.
We could rewrite the BitmapEdit widget to provide its own scrollbars,
controllable through resources.  Although this wouldn't be worth the
effort, it could lead to better scrolling performance.
This new widget, which might be called ScrolledBitmap, would be a
composite widget and have three children: BitmapEdit and two
ScrollBar widgets.  This kind of compound widget
is actually made up of several widgets, but to the application
writer it should act like a single widget.  The advantage of this
rewrite would be that the application code would become simpler, and
the bitmap editor with scrollbars could be easily used in other
applications.  The fourth major section of this chapter describes
how to write a compound widget.Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups, describes how to write a widget capable of being the
parent of gadgets, which are windowless widgets.ID="IX-1013-12-11"borderwidthID="IX-1013-12-12"geometry managementborder widthID="IX-1013-12-13"geometry managementscope
It is a good idea to define exactly what is meant by the geometry
of a widget.  The geometry of a widget is its position, its size,
and its border width. These are the Core fields x, y,
width, height, and border_width.  Border width
is included because window positions are measured from the origin of
the parent (the top-left corner inside the border of the
parent) to the top-left corner outside the border of the child.
Therefore, changing the border width of a widget by 1 pixel moves
the origin of that widget 1 pixel along both the x and y axes
relative to its parent.
This concept is shown in

The key methods in a composite widget are the Core methods
resize and
query_ geometry and the Composite methods
geometry_manager and change_managed.  We will discuss
these methods first, and then move on to the other methods defined by
Composite, insert_child and delete_child, which are
infrequently used.

do.  In short, they handle interactions with the three generations
of widgets involved in direct geometry interactions with a composite
widget: the parent of the composite widget, the composite widget
itself, and the children of the composite widget.MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-12-30"resizingmethods, resizeID="IX-1013-12-31"methodsresizeID="IX-1013-12-32" SPAN="START"widgetsresizing
The resize method
moves and resizes the child widgets as necessary to fit within
the composite widget's new size.ID="IX-1013-12-33"methodsquery_geometryThe query_geometry method supplies a preferred geometry to
a widget's parent when the parent calls XtQueryGeometry().
The parent makes this call in the process of determining a new layout
for its children.ID="IX-1013-12-34"methodsgeometry_managerThe geometry_manager method
handles resize requests from the child widgets.
Usually, the only kind of child that will make a resize request to the parent
is another composite or constraint widget.  However, some simple widgets
do request resizing.  For example,
when a Label widget's string is changed through
ID="IX-1013-12-35"Label widget
resources, the Label widget increases its own size (this is allowed
only in the set_values method).
Xt then calls the parent's
geometry_manager method, which must
decide whether this new size is acceptable and then make any changes.
When a child widget asks for more space and the composite widget
doesn't have enough, the composite widget's geometry_manager
may ask its own parent for more space by calling
XtMakeGeometryRequest().ID="IX-1013-12-36"methodschange_managedID="IX-1013-12-37"widgetschild widget; creating/managingID="IX-1013-12-38"change_managed method
The change_managed method changes the layout of the children
when a child is managed or unmanaged.  A child is managed initially
when XtRealizeWidget() is called (after children are
created with XtCreateManagedWidget()) or when XtManageChild()
or XtManageChildren() is called to add an already-realized
widget to a composite parent's managed set.
(A widget can be unmanaged later to remove it from the
screen without destroying it, and then managed again at any time.  Each
time a child is managed or unmanaged, or destroyed, 
the change_managed method is called.)The resize and query_geometry methods were already
introduced in Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods, as they are written in
simple widgets.  In composite widgets, they have the same job, but it
is more complicated because they now have children to worry about.
We will discuss these methods again in this chapter as they appear in
composite widgets.To write any of these four methods, you need to look at
all the ways that geometry changes can occur, so that you know all the
situations in which the methods will be called.  Here are the four
most important situations:MARK="BULLET"During the negotiation that takes place to determine
the initial size of each widget when an application starts up.When the user resizes the entire application.When a widget requests a size change from the application.When a widget is resized by the application.As you can see, there are many cases.  It
helps to be systematic about understanding and programming for these
cases.  The next four sections describe each of these cases one at a
time.The complexity of the geometry negotiations in the following
description may be intimidating.  A truly general-purpose composite
widget is a large, complex piece of software.  You should leave this
programming to the widget writers who write commercial widget sets,
and concentrate on things that are more important in your application.
The purpose of this description is to let you understand how complete
composite widgets work, not to suggest that you should try to write
one.  However, it is possible to write small, special-purpose
composite widgets that solve particular layout problems.
Composite widgets are simpler when they are more authoritarian--when
they don't do as much to try to satisfy the preferences of their
children.  LINKEND="S1-1013-12-2"Section 12.2, "Writing a Composite Widget" describes ScrollBox, a simple composite
widget designed solely to manage a main widget and two scrollbars.

ID="IX-1013-12-43"XtMoveWidgetID="IX-1013-12-44"XtResizeWidgetXtRealizeWidget() initiates a geometry negotiation that
ripples through the widget hierarchy (as is described
below).  The widgets' realize methods (which create windows
for the widgets) are not called until this process is complete.XtRealizeWidget()first calls the change_managed method
of every composite widget in the application, beginning
with the lowest widgets in the hierarchy (called a post-order
traversal).  Each change_managed method determines an initial
size for each child and calls XtMoveWidget() and/or
XtResizeWidget() for the child.  All the change_managed
methods are called until the one in the Shell widget.  (Remember that
the Shell widget is a composite widget that has only one child.)  The
child is also a composite widget (except in single-widget
applications such as xhello).  When the Shell widget is
reached, the Shell widget size is
set to the size of its child and the process stops unless the user
has specified an initial geometry for the entire application through
the resource database or command line.

the child composite, and this resize method reconsiders the

will decide on a new size based on the compromise, and may or

because the suggestions and answers are in the form of structures
with several fields.  Only the Frame, MainWindow, and ScrolledWindow

new round of
geometry negotiation takes place, identical to the process described

displayed in the widget, it may be logical for the widget to ask its
parent for a new size.  This would occur in the set_values
method of the widget.  The widget sets its desired
geometry into its Core geometry fields
(width, height, x, y, and
border_width).  Xt finishes calling all the set_values
methods (because they chain), and then calls
XtMakeGeometryRequest() to ask the parent widget for a geometry
change.  Note that the set_values and initialize
methods are the only place where widgets are allowed to set their own
size directly.  (In set_values they can do so only because
of an XtVaSetValues() call to change a resource that affects

children have asked to be resized.  The composite widget has
no knowledge of what caused the child's size change.  Therefore,
composite widgets call XtMakeGeometryRequest() themselves to
see if their parent will allow them to change size.  Composite
widgets should request such a change; otherwise their parent
may have unused space or have other children that need more space.
However, handling the variety of responses to the request is not
trivial.
ID="IX-1013-12-79"geometry managementresizing; by widget requestID="IX-1013-12-80"geometry managementmethodsID="IX-1013-12-81"methodsgeometry_manager
For both simple and composite widgets, Xt calls the
geometry_manager method of the
parent widget when XtMakeGeometryRequest() is called, and the
method is responsible for deciding whether to except, reject, or
compromise on the requested geometry.  The geometry_manager
method may have to ask its parent to decide whether it can
accept its child's proposal.  If so, it makes another
XtMakeGeometryRequest() call.  This can go on to arbitrary
depth, and the final answer will trickle back down to the
parent of the original requestor.  The XtMakeGeometryRequest()
call itself will change the child's geometry if the answer is yes.
If the answer is no, the child gets this information and may try
another geometry.  If the answer is a compromise, then the child will
get the compromise information returned in its call to
XtMakeGeometryRequest() and make another request to be able to
proceed.  More on this interaction in LINKEND="S2-1013-12-10"Section 12.2.6, "XtMakeGeometryRequest and the geometry_manager Method."ID="IX-1013-12-82"XtQueryGeometryID="IX-1013-12-83"geometry managementXtQueryGeometry
This process uses only the geometry_manager methods of each
widget.  However, this method may call XtQueryGeometry() to
determine the needs of each of its children before replying to the
XtMakeGeometryRequest() request.  When the process is
finished, the resize method is called for any widgets
that have been resized.
However, the change_managed method is never involved.

directly (as opposed to setting a resource which indirectly
affects the size, as covered in the last section).
If that widget has no children, the widget code does nothing,
but Xt queries the parent with an XtMakeGeometryRequest().

writing a simple widget.  You copy the three files of some existing
composite widget, perhaps Composite itself, make global name changes to
make the files a skeleton for a distinct class, and then write new
methods.As mentioned earlier, writing a general-purpose composite widget
is not a trivial task and should be done only when other options
fail.
Because composite widgets have no user interface, you may be able to
find a composite widget with the proper characteristics from another
widget set.  There are several public domain widget sets to
look in.  Note, however, that commercial widget set vendors may design
in a private protocol between their composite widgets and their
children, which make the composite widgets unable to correctly manage
widgets from other sets.  And if you are writing a commercial
product, you may have to pay a binary license fee
to the commercial widget set vendor for each copy of your
product.  Especially for large software houses, it is a good idea to
have at least one programmer adept at writing composite widgets and
the query_geometry methods of simple widgets.Small scale composite widgets that handle a small set
of circumstances are not difficult to write, because you can
make a number of simplifying assumptions.
ID="IX-1013-12-95" SPAN="START"scrollbarsScrollBox widget
As an example, this section describes a very simple composite widget
called ScrollBox, which is
designed to manage a BitmapEdit widget (or any other main widget) and two
ScrollBar widgets.
It handles only these three widgets, and they must be added in a
particular order.  Because we know the geometry preferences of these
three widgets (the bigger the better, but no size in particular), we can
dispense with querying them about their preferred geometry.
We also know that none of our children will request to be resized.
Therefore, we do not need a geometry_manager method.A ScrollBox widget is shown managing BitmapEdit and two scrollbars in

way than does ScrollBox.
It is a subclass of Form that takes any main window as a child
and creates scrollbars.  It shows only a small portion of the main
window and uses the scrollbars to determine which portion of the main
window is shown.  But Viewport doesn't work well with BitmapEdit because
BitmapEdit has a built-in ability to display in a smaller window that
conflicts with Viewport's efforts.  Besides, Viewport is several
times larger and more complicated than ScrollBox, because it includes
the scrollbar callback functions and because it honors a child's
geometry preferences.  ScrollBox is a modest
widget that manages the geometry
of scrollbars, leaving their connection
with the main window up to the application.  This demonstrates
the essential elements of a composite widget without too much
complication.LINKEND="FN-1013-12-3"ID="FN-1013-12-3"It is worth noting that the Box widget fails
miserably in managing scrollbars, while Form is adequate but has the
annoying characteristic that it resizes the width of the scrollbars
as well as their length, sometimes resulting in bloated or minuscule
scrollbars.The ScrollBox widget code, along with a version of xbitmap that
uses it, is available in the example source in the ch09 directory.
It lays out its children by adjusting the width and height of
the three children so that they fill the ScrollBox widget,
while keeping the width of the Scrollbar widgets constant.
The width of the Scrollbar widgets is set through their resources and
is never modified by ScrollBox.The first few sections below describe the methods that are used in
ScrollBox and that are required in all composite widgets.
First, we discuss the Core initialize, realize,
set_values, resize, and query_geometry methods
as they are used in composite widgets.  Then, we discuss how the
ScrollBox widget implements layout calculations in a common routine
called by the set_values, resize, and
change_managed values.  This is followed by further
discussion of the change_managed and query_geometry
methods.
Then, we go on to discuss the methods not used by ScrollBox, but that
would be used in more complicated composite widgets, in particular
geometry_manager.  Finally, we briefly discuss the methods
available in composite widgets but rarely needed:
set_values_almost, insert_child, and
delete_child.
ID="IX-1013-12-98" SPAN="END"widgetsresizingID="S2-1013-12-5"Basic Core Methods in Composite WidgetsBoth composite and constraint widgets are subclasses of Core.
Therefore, they have all the Core methods described in Chapters 6 and 7.  However, since composite and constraint
widgets usually
have no input and output semantics, the expose method is
set to NULL and the widget has no default translation table or
actions.  As a result, all the event-oriented fields in the Core
class structure become irrelevant to composite and constraint widgets.ID="IX-1013-12-99"initialize methodID="IX-1013-12-100"methodsinitialize; calling XInternAtomID="IX-1013-12-101"methodsrealizeID="IX-1013-12-102"methodsset_values
But composite and constraint widgets do use the Core
initialize, realize, and set_valuesID="IX-1013-12-103"realize method
methods.
These methods have the same roles as for simple widgets.
The initialize method initializes instance part variables
ID="IX-1013-12-104"initialize methodID="IX-1013-12-105"realize methodID="IX-1013-12-106"set_values method
and checks initial resource values.
The realize method sets window attribute values and then
creates a window for the widget.
The set_values method updates any instance part fields
that depend on resources.
Since composite and constraint widgets
don't need GCs, initialize and set_values don't
contain code to create and change GCs as in simple widgets.These three methods for ScrollBox are absolutely minimal, and
call a common routine called DoLayout when any actual
sizing or positioning of widgets is required.
The initialize method simply sets the widget's default
width and height, the realize method is inherited,
and the set_values method changes the layout of children
when either of ScrollBox's two resources is changed.  These resources
control the vertical and horizontal distance in pixels that will
be left between the Scrollbar widgets and the main widget, and between
each of these widgets and the borders of ScrollBox.

in all widgets, composite and simple, a composite widget's
size preference depends on its children.  Normally this means
the query_geometry method will query its children and try
different layouts until it arrives at the geometry, or some
approximation of it, suggested
by its parent.  This calculation is
complicated because the widget may have any kind of child, and their
responses to geometry suggestions are unpredictable.
ScrollBox ignores this complexity because it knows exactly what
kinds of children it will have and what their characteristics are.
Therefore, its query_geometry method is basically the same
as the query_geometry method of a simple widget.To be more precise, what this query_geometry method does
is accept any size suggested by the parent which is larger than
the minimum useful size of the application.  When the suggested
size is too small, the query_geometry method uses the
minimum useful size as a compromise.  Note, however, that this
is really hardcoding the characteristics of the child into our
composite widget.  It would be better to add resources to control
the minimum useful size.

according to its layout policy.  This routine may query the children
with XtQueryGeometry() before making decisions, but it is not
required to.  In this case, there is no need to because ScrollBox
handles only two types of widgets with no size preferences.DoLayout is passed only one argument, ScrollBox's own widget
ID (a pointer to its widget instance structure).  But the composite
children field in ScrollBox's instance structure is an array
of the IDs of all the children, and num_children is the
number of children.LINKEND="FN-1013-12-4"ID="FN-1013-12-4"Incidentally, the children and num_children fields
are resources.  However, they are read-only from outside
the widget code; the application should never set them with
XtSetValues().
ID="IX-1013-12-125"XtSetValuesWhen each child is added to a composite widget, its ID is added to
the children field of the composite part of the instance
structure, and the num_children field is incremented.
Therefore, the code to lay out the children is usually a loop that
treats each child one at a time.  This often takes two passes, since
the routine needs to know which children are managed before it
can determine their final geometries.  All children,
even unmanaged ones, are listed in the children and
num_children fields.This particular DoLayout procedure makes sure that there are
exactly three children and that they are all managed.  Then, it calculates
the positions and sizes for all the children so that they will fill all
the available space in ScrollBox's own window.  Finally, it calls
XtResizeWidget() and XtMoveWidget(), which check to see

application later unmanages a managed widget or manages an unmanaged

An application unmanages a widget
to remove the widget from visibility without destroying it, and at the
same time to tell the composite widget to change the layout of the
remaining widgets to fill the gap.  This is done by calling
XtUnmanageChild() or XtUnmanageChildren().
The application can then make the composite widget
redisplay the widget by calling XtManageChild() or
XtManageChildren().  This response depends on the Core
XtNmappedWhenManaged resource having its default value, True.
When set to False, the management state has no effect on
mapping, and the application must call XtMapWidget() and
XtUnmapWidget() instead.  Usually an application does this so that
a widget will become invisible without triggering a re-layout to
fill in the space it has vacated.  Therefore, change_managed
need not check the XtNmapWhenManaged resource of each child.

basic composite widget such as ScrollBox has a standard
initialize method, resize and change_managed
methods that just call DoLayout, and a set_values
method that calls DoLayout when any resource that affects
layout is changed.   The DoLayout routine actually lays
out the children.  The widget's query_geometry method
is basically just like a simple widget's query_geometry.
Now we'll move on to describe what may be added to this

The query_geometry method for simple widgets is described in
Chapter 7, Basic Widget Methods.  The role of this method in composite
widgets is the same, but the details
of its job are different.  You may recall that this method is
passed pointers to two XtWidgetGeometry structures, one which
specifies the parent's proposed geometry, and the other which is used
by the
child to return a compromise geometry.  These two structures are
allocated by the method that calls XtQueryGeometry() and
passed as pointers to that call.  The XtGeometryResultenum

the child's response to your proposed size.
You will also need to write a query_geometry method so that
your composite can respond to its parent's XtQueryGeometry()
request.ID="IX-1013-12-144"sizepreferencesID="IX-1013-12-145"geometry managementsize preferencesID="IX-1013-12-146"geometry managementquerying; preferred geometry
A query_geometry method in a composite widget should base its
response on the size preferences of its children.  It should calculate
a new layout based on the proposed geometry passed in, and then
query its children to get their opinions of their new geometry.
If any of the children is a composite widget, they may query their
children, and so on.  Therefore, these
requests tend to trickle down to the lowest widget in the hierarchy.
ScrollBox took the biggest shortcuts in its query_geometry
method.  Not only didn't it query its children, but it hardcoded its
response based on the characteristics of the kind of main window
it expected.  This would be the first place to begin improving
ScrollBox.
ID="IX-1013-12-147"geometry managementtrickle-downNote, however, that a composite widget is allowed to be authoritarian
and not ask its children whether they like the sizes they are about
to be given.  However, this kind of composite widget will not be suitable
as a parent of a widget that really needs certain size preferences.A parent must specify a complete proposed geometry
when calling XtQueryGeometry(), not just the changes it intends
to make.ID="S2-1013-12-10"XtMakeGeometryRequest and the geometry_manager MethodID="IX-1013-12-148" SPAN="START"methodsgeometry_managerXtMakeGeometryRequest() calls are made for two reasons.
First, when a composite widget honors its children's size preferences, it
may find that its current size is inadequate to lay out its children.
In this case, it should ask its parent to be resized by calling
XtMakeGeometryRequest().
ID="IX-1013-12-149"XtMakeGeometryRequest
Second, Xt calls XtMakeGeometryRequest() for a widget when
the application has changed a resource that affects geometry.As mentioned above, XtMakeGeometryRequest() calls the parent's
geometry_ manager method.  The parent's geometry_manager
has the job of deciding whether the size proposed by the child
is acceptable.
ID="IX-1013-12-150"XtInherit constantsXtInheritGeometryManager
A subclass of Composite must either define a
geometry_manager method, or set this field in the class
structure to NULL, because there is no default method to
inherit.  The XtInheritGeometryManager symbol can be used
only in subclasses of a class that defines a
geometry_manager method.  Any composite widget allowing its
children to suggest resizing will require a geometry_manager
method of its own.The way the arguments and
returned values are passed between XtMakeGeometryRequest() and
the parent's geometry_manager method is almost exactly
parallel to the way XtQueryGeometry() calls the child's
query_geometry method.  Both
calls take pointers to two structures of the same types where one is
used for a returned compromise.  Both take no more arguments other
than the widget ID.  Both return an enum value of type
XtGeometryResult.  The returned value of the
geometry_manager method is, generally speaking, passed
through as the returned value of XtMakeGeometryRequest().
Review LINKEND="S1-1013-7-6"Section 7.6, "The query_geometry Method" so that these structures, their fields and
values, and the returned values are fresh in your mind.One difference between the way the query_geometry and
geometry_manager methods are invoked is that the
geometry_manager method can return a fourth enum value,
XtGeometryDone (in addition to XtGeometryYes,
ID="IX-1013-12-151"XtGeometryDone constantXtGeometryNo, and XtGeometryAlmost).
The return codes of the geometry_manager
method are summarized in

geometry_manager approves of the change and has actually made
the change.
XtMakeGeometryRequest() never returns
XtGeometryDone though; it returns XtGeometryYes
when the geometry_manager returns
XtGeometryYes or XtGeometryDone.
When the geometry_manager returns XtGeometryYes,
the XtMakeGeometryRequest() call itself makes the size change.
All these shenanigans simply allow the parent to make the size
change by calling its normal layout code or to let
XtMakeGeometryRequest() do it, depending on which is most
convenient.The second difference is that XtMakeGeometryRequest() and the
geometry_manager method interpret the XtGeometryNo
returned value differently.
For XtMakeGeometryRequest() and
geometry_manager, it has its intuitive meaning that the
requested change is denied.  For query_geometry and
XtQueryGeometry(), the symbol should really be
XtGeometryNoChange.   Since this symbol doesn't exist,
XtGeometryNo has to do double duty, meaning in this case
that the proposed size and current size are the same.ID="IX-1013-12-164"XtWidgetGeometryID="IX-1013-12-165"geometry managementXtWidgetGeometryID="IX-1013-12-166"XtCWQueryOnly maskID="IX-1013-12-167"geometry managementquerying; XtQueryOnly constant
The final difference is an additional mask for the
request_mode field of the XtWidgetGeometry
structure that contains the proposed change.
In XtMakeGeometryRequest() requests,
the mask XtCWQueryOnly can be ORed with
the masks that identify which fields in the proposed geometry
the child considers important.
This indicates that the proposed change should not be made, but
that the geometry_manager method should fill in the
return structure with the changes it would have made.
This flag is used whenever a widget is making an
XtMakeGeometryRequest() from its geometry_manager
method:  these requests are intermediate (triggered by requests
from children).  The composite widget does not actually want to be resized
until it has made a suggestion for its own size to its parent,
received an answer from the parent, recalculated the layout of
its children, and queried its children, if necessary, to see that the new
size is adequate for everybody.
ID="IX-1013-12-168"geometry managementwhat if requestsThis also makes it obvious that the geometry_manager method
you write for your composite widget must be prepared to handle
the XtCWQueryOnly mask.  It should calculate a layout but
not actually move or resize any widgets.ScrollBox does not need a geometry_manager method because it
knows that its children will never make geometry requests.  However,
any composite widget that accepts all kinds of children requires a
geometry_manager method.  In LINKEND="S2-1013-12-18"Section 12.4.6, "The geometry_manager Method" below, the
geometry_manager method of the Form widget is shown and
described.ID="IX-1013-12-169"XtMakeResizeRequestID="IX-1013-12-170"geometry managementXtMakeResizeRequest
Similar to XtMakeGeometryRequest(), but less general, is
XtMakeResizeRequest().  Instead of passing two structures,
XtMakeResizeRequest() passes two width and height pairs.
Otherwise, the results of this call are the same.Shell widgets (which are a subclass of Composite) have an extension
structure (see LINKEND="S1-1013-14-13"Section 14.13, "Class Extension Structures") that contains a
root_geometry_manager field.
ID="IX-1013-12-171"root_geometry_manager
This field is a pointer to a function which acts like the
geometry_manager method that would exist in the composite
parent of the Shell widget, if Shell had one.  This method is
needed because the only "parent" of Shell is the window manager.
Since it is unlikely that you will need to write your own
Shell widget, you are unlikely to have to write or even read
a root_geometry_manager method.

change for one of three reasons:
ID="IX-1013-12-175"widgetresizing; reasons forID="IX-1013-12-176"resizingreasonsMARK="BULLET"The application just called XtSetValues() and set a geometry
field.  In this case, Xt makes the geometry request to the parent
to allow the parent to overrule or modify the change.The application just called XtSetValues() and set a resource
that affects geometry, like the string displayed in a Label widget.
The set_values method of the child changes the geometry
fields in the widget directly.  Then Xt makes a geometry request to
the parent, to allow the parent to overrule or modify the change.The child may decide it needs more or less room because of some kind
of user input, or because its own children need more or less
room.  In this case, it calls XtMakeGeometryRequest()
itself, and handles the various returned values itself.  If the widget
wants to use set_values_almost to make compromise
suggestions (since it is designed for that purpose and may be there anyway),
the widget
will have to call the method itself.In the first two cases, Xt calls XtMakeGeometryRequest(), while
in the third case, the child must call the function itself.
If the returned value is XtGeometryYes, the
XtMakeGeometryRequest() call itself (or Xt) has resized the child.ID="IX-1013-12-177"geometry managementalmost rightWhen XtMakeGeometryRequest() is called by Xt,
and its returned value is XtGeometryAlmost or
XtGeometryNo, Xt calls the set_values_almost method
of the widget whose geometry is changing.
A return value of XtGeometryNo is like the parent saying: "I
don't like the geometry you suggested, and I don't have any
compromise to suggest."  A return value of XtGeometryAlmost
means "The geometry you suggested is not quite acceptable: would
this compromise suit you?"The job of set_values_almost is to accept the compromise
ID="IX-1013-12-178" SPAN="START"methodsset_values_almost
geometry proposed by the parent or to propose a different
geometry to the parent.  Once a new geometry is proposed by
the set_values_almost method, Xt calls the parent's
geometry_manager method again, and the cycle repeats until the
geometry_manager returns
XtGeometryYes or XtGeometryDone, or until the child
gives up trying to change size.

XtInheritSetValuesAlmost in the Core class part
initialization.  This inherited method always approves the
suggestion made by the parent geometry_manager method.
If your widget really depends on being certain sizes, however, you will
need to write a set_values_

method.
You should never specify a
NULL set_values_almost method
because Xt will print a warning message when
set_values_almost would have been called, and continue as
if it had been called and had returned XtGeometryYes.ID="IX-1013-12-180"XtWidgetGeometryThe set_values_almost method is passed pointers to two
XtWidgetGeometry structures:  request and reply.
The request structure contains the child's original request
and reply includes the geometry_manager method's
compromise geometry if geometry_manager returned
XtGeometryAlmost.
To accept the compromise, the procedure must copy the contents
of the reply geometry into the request geometry; to attempt an
alternate geometry, the procedure may modify any part of the request
argument; to terminate the geometry negotiation and retain the
original geometry, the procedure must set
request->request_mode to zero.ID="IX-1013-12-181"XtGeometryNo constantIf geometry_manager returned XtGeometryNo, it
will not have generated a compromise.  In this case, the
set_values_almost method may suggest a new geometry,
but it is probably not worth it since the method has no information
upon which to base its changes to its previous suggestion.
The set_values_almost method at this point should usually
just set request->request_mode to zero to terminate the
geometry negotiation.

an array of all the widget's children (even those not currently
managed), the current number of children, and the total number of
child slots available.
The insert_child method inserts the ID of a child into this
array.  It is called when the child is created by a call to
XtCreateWidget() or XtCreateManagedWidget().
Most widgets inherit the insert_child method from the
Composite class by specifying the symbolic constant
XtInheritInsertChild in the class structure initialization.
A class would replace the default insert_child method
to control the position of each child added, or to
limit the number or classes of widgets that can be added.

A composite widget can control the position of each child added
by calling a function whose pointer is stored in the instance part
field insert_position.
The function should return the number of
widgets before the widget.  The XtNinsertPosition resource
sets this function pointer.  The default insert_position
function returns the current number of children.  Of course, because
this resource's value is a function pointer, it can be specified in
the application only at run time, never through the resource files or
command line.ID="IX-1013-12-191"XtDestroyWidgetID="IX-1013-12-192"geometry managementXtDestroyWidget
The delete_child method removes the ID of a child from
the child array and is called when the application calls
XtDestroyWidget().  This method is almost always inherited
from Composite by specifying the symbolic constant
XtInheritDeleteChild in the class structure initialization.

said about composite widgets is still true.  Because Constraint is
a subclass of Composite, all the methods
described above are still present and have the same tasks.  However,
constraint widgets also maintain a structure full of data attached to each
child, set through resources.  Every time it lays out the children,
the constraint widget reads this data to determine how to handle that child.
Of course,
it still may query each children to get its opinion of a new size.
The constraint information adds another level of complexity to the situation.Like composite widgets, constraint widgets can be drastically
simplified by reducing flexibility and features.  The Athena Form
widget, for example, never queries its children for their geometry input and never asks
its parent for a size change.  Furthermore, its constraints for
each child are quite limited.  This makes Form quite short and
simple, but also means that it doesn't always do the right thing.ID="S1-1013-12-4"Writing a Constraint WidgetID="IX-1013-12-199" SPAN="START"Form widgetID="IX-1013-12-200"constraint widgetswritingThe following sections describe the portions of the Athena Form widget
that relate to geometry management.  We have
chosen the Athena Form widget instead of the Motif Form widget because
the Athena Form widget is less than one quarter the size and is
much simpler to understand.
The principles at work are similar, and an understanding of the
Athena implementation should give you a good start towards understanding
geometry management under Motif.However, before we start, an introduction to the constraints of the
Athena Form widget is in order.
As you should remember, constraints appear
to the user to be resources of the child widgets
managed by the Form.  Looking at these resources gives you a good
idea of the kinds of things that can be done with Athena Form
constraints.

specify the widget position in terms of a specified number of
pixels horizontally away from another widget in the form.
As an example,
XtNhorizDistance
could equal 10 and
XtNfromHoriz 
could be the widget ID of
another widget in the Form.
(When specified in a resource file, XtNfromHoriz is
set using the instance name of another widget in the form.)
The new widget will always be placed
10 pixels to the right of the
widget defined in
XtNfromHoriz, regardless of the size of the Form.
If
XtNfromHoriz
equals NULL, then
XtNhorizDistance
is measured from the left edge of the Form.Similarly, the resources XtNvertDistance and XtNfromVert specify
the widget position in terms of a specified number of pixels vertically
away from another widget in the Form.
If XtNfromVert  equals NULL, then XtNvertDistance 
is measured from the top of the Form.When set in the application, the values for XtNfromHoriz
and XtNFromVert must be widget IDs.  But in the resource
database, widget names are used instead, since the actual widget ID
changes each time the application is run.  Athena uses an Xmu converter
from widget name to widget ID, which is useful when setting constraints
from resource files.  However, Motif does not provide such a converter.
ID="IX-1013-12-205"stringsStringToWidget resource converterThe XtNtop, XtNbottom, XtNleft, and XtNright
resources tell the Form where to position the child when the Form is
resized.  The values of these resources are specified by the
enum XtEdgeType, which
is defined in <X11/Xaw/Form.h>.The values
XtChainTop,
XtChainBottom,
XtChainLeft,
and
XtChainRight
specify that a constant distance is to be maintained from an edge of
the child to, respectively,
the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the Form.The value XtRubber
specifies that a proportional distance from the edge of the child to
the left or top edge of the Form is to be maintained when the
Form is resized.  The proportion is determined from the initial
position of the child and the initial size of the Form.

This structure has public fields set through resources and private
fields that hold state data, just like an instance part structure.
Note also that the FormConstraints structure is built the
same way as instance structures, by combining part structures for
each class into a complete constraint structure.  This allows subclasses
of Form to create their own constraint part structure and add it after
the Form constraint part.When a widget is created as a child of a constraint widget,
the constraint instance structure (FormConstraintsRec, in
this case) is placed in the constraints field of the
Core instance structure.  Xt makes the constraint resources
stored there settable, like resources defined by the child even
though they are actually defined and used by the parent.

defines a class part field--a method of its own, called layout.
Since this method is not known to Xt, Xt will never call it.
The widget must invoke this method itself at the appropriate times
(you will see this invocation in the methods below).
This code is made into a method instead of just a private function only to
make it possible for subclasses of this widget to inherit or replace
the method.  Having such a method requires that the widget have a
class_part_init method to handle the inheritance if
a subclass specifies the layout method with the symbolic
constant XtInheritLayout (also defined in this class's private
header file).LINKEND="S2-1013-12-5"Section 12.2.1, "Basic Core Methods in Composite Widgets" described which Core and Composite methods are
required for composite widgets, and how to initialize the other Core
and Composite fields for a composite widget.  The same is true for
constraint widgets.ID="IX-1013-12-220"constraint widgetsclass; partID="IX-1013-12-221"geometry managementconstraints
However, the Constraint part is probably new to you.
The ConstraintClassPart structure contains seven fields.
The first three fields are where the constraint resource list, the
number of resources, and the size of the constraint instance
structure are entered.  This resource list and instance structure were
described in the last section.  These fields are
analogous to the resources, num_resources, and
widget_size fields in the Core class part.The three next fields, initialize, destroy, and
set_values are methods defined by the Constraint class.
These methods have the same field names as methods of Core, but are
fields of a different structure, and contain pointers to different
functions that you may need to write.  To differentiate Constraint
methods from the Core methods, we will precede the names of
Constraint fields with the word "Constraint" and the names of Core fields
with the word "Core" throughout this chapter.Two of the three Constraint methods will be described
where they fit in below.  We'll describe one of them, Constraint
destroy, now, because it is not used in Form and is less
ID="IX-1013-12-222"methodsdestroy
likely to be needed in the constraint widgets you may write.
The Constraint destroy method is called when a child
ID="IX-1013-12-223"destroy methodConstraint
is destroyed, just before the Core destroy method of the child.
It is responsible for freeing any memory allocated
by the constraint widget that was used to manage that child.
However, like the Core destroy method, it does not need to
free memory allocated by Xt, such as the constraint data structure
for the child.

is created, soon after the Core initialize method.
It has the same two responsibilities as the Core initialize method,
and one additional responsibility.
It must:MARK="BULLET"Validate the ranges of resource settings, since they may be
user-supplied.Compute the value of any private constraint instance part fields
that depend on constraint resource values
(public constraint instance part fields).Set child Core geometry fields to match the constraint
resources.  For example, if a constraint for the maximum height of a
widget is set and the initial value set by the child is larger,
the Constraint initialize method resets the
height field in the Core instance structure.However, like the Core initialize method, the Constraint
initialize method is responsible only
for constraint resources and for Core geometry resources.
It need not handle any resources of superclasses (other than the
Core geometry resources).The Form widget performs only one of the tasks listed
above, initializing constraint resources.  In Form's case, the
Constraint initialize method (shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-12-11"Example 12-11) simply sets the initial values of the XtNvertDistance and
XtNhorizDistance constraint resources to the current value
of the XtNdefaultDistance Form resource, unless the
user has specified a value for either constraint resource.
This is done only so that the application can set the Form resource
once and have it apply to every child that does not override the value.Form doesn't validate the values of any
user-supplied resource values as it should.
For example, the user may supply a negative value for the
XtNhorizDistance or XtNvertDistance resources.
This would certainly make the layout look bad, but it could also
cause the Form widget to go into an infinite loop on geometry
negotiations.  In general, all initialize
methods in Core and Constraint should check for ranges of reasonable
values of resources where this makes sense.  Range checking
eliminates a potential source of bugs.  Range checking in
set_values is also a good idea to give the programmer good
warning messages).

}ID="IX-1013-12-230"methodsConstraint; initializeNote that the Constraint instance part structure
(FormConstraints) and the Form widget instance structure
(FormWidget) are accessed by casting two different
fields of the child's instance structure passed in.The Constraint initialize method and the child's Core
initialize are passed the same two copies of the child's
instance structure:  request, and new.
The request widget is the widget as originally requested.
The new widget starts with the values in the request,
but it has already been updated by calling all superclass
initialize methods.ID="S2-1013-12-17"The class_part_init MethodID="IX-1013-12-231"classclass_part_initialize methodThe class_part_init method should be present in a class
that defines new methods in its class part structure.
These new methods will never be called by Xt since Xt has no
knowledge of when to call them.  They can only be invoked directly
from the widget code.  The purpose of making them methods instead of
just
functions is to allow subclasses to inherit or replace the functions.
The class_part_init method actually resolves this
inheritance by setting each method field to the pointer provided by
this class (the subclass is inheriting the method) or to the pointer
provided by the subclass (the subclass is replacing the method).
LINKEND="EX-1013-12-12"Example 12-12 shows a class_part_init method for
a class that defines only one new method in its class part structure.
This method is the Form widget's layout code.ID="EX-1013-12-12"Form: the class_part_init methodstatic void ClassPartInitialize(class)
    WidgetClass class;
{
    register FormWidgetClass c = (FormWidgetClass) class;
    if (c->form_class.layout == XtInheritLayout)
        c->form_class.layout = Layout;
}The XtInheritLayout symbol is defined in the private include
file for any class that defines new class part methods (one for each
new method).  Its value is always _XtInherit.Form itself sets the layout field to a pointer to its
Layout function.  When its class_part_init
method is called when the first instance of Form is created,
it does nothing because the layout field is not
XtInheritLayout.  When a subclass is defined that sets
the layout field to a function, the same thing
happens:  Form's class_part_init method is called because
it is chained downward (the class_part_init methods of
all superclasses are called), and it still does nothing because
the layout field is not XtInheritLayout.  Thus, the
subclass has replaced Form's method.  But if
the subclass sets the layout field to XtInheritLayout, 
Form's class_part_init method sets the field to its own
Layout function.  The subclass has inherited Form's method.Usually, only the class that defines a particular new method resolves
the inheritance by checking for the value of that field in its
class_part_init method.  There is no point in a subclass also
checking for an XtInherit value, since the
downward chaining means that the superclass will have already processed
and replaced the XtInherit value before the subclass
class_part_init method is called.ID="S2-1013-12-18"The geometry_manager MethodID="IX-1013-12-232"methodsgeometry_managerID="IX-1013-12-233"methodsgeometry_managergeometry_manager methods handle requests from the children
to be resized.
Therefore, they typically use the proposed geometry
passed in from the child to calculate a new experimental layout, and
actually move and resize the children if the new layout is acceptable.
However, when the request is just a query, the method should
be able to return the same values without actually moving or resizing
anything.The Form geometry_manager method is shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-12-13"Example 12-13.
Note that Form uses the allow_resize field (the XtNresizable
resource) to determine whether to even consider the resize request.
Then, if the request specifies a width and height, Form will accept
the change by returning XtGeometryYes.  The
XtMakeGeometryRequest() call that invoked the
geometry_manager will actually make the geometry change before
returning to the child's code.  If the request
specifies any other geometry change
(border width, position, or stacking order), Form will deny the
request.  Finally, if the request was not a query, Form actually
does the new layout.  Note that Form never returns
ID="IX-1013-12-234"XtGeometryDone constantID="IX-1013-12-235"XtGeometryYes constantXtGeometryDone since it never makes the geometry changes
itself.  Instead it returns XtGeometryYes
when it agrees with the changes, and lets Xt make the changes.Note that the allowed structure in this routine could be
replaced by individual width and height variables.
Also note that the reply structure is never filled;
it is used only when the geometry_manager method wants
to suggest a compromise.ID="EX-1013-12-13"Form: the geometry_manager method/* ARGSUSED */

first initializing the layout_state private
constraint instance field of each child to LayoutPending.
The LayoutChild routine will start from this value.
Next, it calls LayoutChild for each child, and at the same
time keeps a running total of the sizes of the children so that when
the loop is finished it knows how big to be to fit all the children.
Finally, it requests of its parent that it be just big enough
to fit its children.  If the parent denies the request, the code makes
no attempt to make another request.  If the parent offers a compromise,
it is accepted.  The Form widget, in either case, may be too big or too
small to fit its children.  If it is too small, some of its children
will be clipped.The LayoutChild routine is shown in

the children in the virtual_width and virtual_height

at the new size.  This is done because Form's XtNtop,
XtNbottom, XtNleft, and XtNright
constraints specify the geometry of the child based on its previous
geometry.Notice that the for loop in this particular resize
method loops through the children directly, using pointer
arithmetic.
This is equivalent to using a loop that increments an integer
and then uses the integer to index the children array.  For
example, the first five lines of the loop could also be expressed as:ID="SC-1013-12-1"int i;

of a child of a constraint widget, Xt calls the child's Core
set_values method and then the parent's Constraint
set_values method.  Both methods are passed the same arguments.
Constraint set_values validates the ranges of constraint
resource settings and computes the value of any private
constraint instance part fields that depend on constraint resource
values.  It should also set child Core geometry fields to match the
changes in constraint resources.
For example, if a constraint for the maximum height of a widget is
changed to a value smaller than the widget's current
height, then the Constraint set_values procedure should reset the
height field in the widget.Both Core and Constraint set_values
must return True or False to indicate whether
redisplay of the widget is necessary.  For composite and constraint
widgets, this value is usually meaningless because there is nothing
to redisplay.  But these might be useful if, for some reason, you
write a composite widget that does have display semantics.Form defines both the Core and Constraint set_values
methods as empty functions that return False.  An easier
way to do this is to specify NULL for them in the class structure

the change_managed method of a composite widget is called
only once even though many children may have been managed.
However, after that, change_managed is called once for
every child that changes management state.  Many composite or
constraint widgets,
especially ones that have complicated layout code, provide
a public function (such as the one shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-12-19"Example 12-19) that the application can call to turn off layout recalculation until a
group of windows is managed or unmanaged, and then call again to
trigger recalculation once the whole group of children has been
managed or unmanaged.To implement this delay, you need an instance variable to hold
a Boolean value indicating whether to delay or not
(no_refigure, in this case).  You set and unset this variable
in this public routine and you test it in change_managed.

to make a higher-level, user-interface object.  For example,
a ScrolledWindow widget is itself a composite widget, but it
automatically creates its own ScrollBar children.
Similarly, the code for MessageBox can create its own Shell parent,
and it creates PushButtonGadget children that read OK, Cancel, and Help.Compound widgets create their children in
their initialize method, and set
resources to position them.  Often they also provide resources
of functions that make it easy for the application to
configure some characteristics of their
children.  The application can manipulate the children only through
these resources, because it cannot access the widget IDs of the
compound widget's subwidgets without breaking the rules of data
hiding.  Thus, compound widgets are convenient for programming,
but they make it more difficult to take advantage of all
the configurable aspects of the subwidgets.The main widget of the compound widget may be a subclass of
Core, Composite, or Constraint.  If it is a subclass of Core, the widget manages the
positions and sizes of its children manually whenever it is resized.
The success of this strategy is dependent on the children never trying
to resize themselves and on the application never trying to resize the
children directly.LINKEND="FN-1013-12-7"ID="FN-1013-12-7"When a child of a simple widget calls XtMakeGeometryRequest()
because it wants to change its size, XtMakeGeometryRequest()
always makes the requested changes and returns XtGeometryYes.
Therefore, a simple widget parent really has no control over its
child if the child wants to resize itself.  A simple widget cannot
even tell that the child has resized itself.
The latter will not be a problem unless the application breaks the
data-hiding rules by manipulating the child directly.
The Text widget is an example of this kind of widget.  It creates and
manages its own scrollbar.Compound widgets normally define only a few methods and inherit the
rest.
Compound widgets based on Core will move and resize their children
manually in their resize method.
If the widget is a subclass of Composite or Constraint, the normal geometry management facilities
manage the position and size of the children.  If it is a subclass of
Constraint, the
main widget sets the constraints of the children to control
the geometry management process by providing a Constraint
initialize method.A compound widget always needs a destroy method
that destroys the children it created.
Compound widgets also need a set_values method to manage their
resources.

widgets can control the stacking order of their children.  We noted
that this must be done manually, because Xt doesn't provide much
support for it.  This is because most applications do not stack
widgets--the whole concept of geometry management is based on
each widget trying to lay out its children without stacking them.
However, there are applications where it makes sense to stack widgets.
For example, an application that provides note cards, where each card
is a widget, would want to stack them showing only the corner of hidden
cards.ID="IX-1013-12-277"XConfigureWindow Xlib functionID="IX-1013-12-278"XRestackWindows Xlib functionID="IX-1013-12-279"XRaiseWindow Xlib functionID="IX-1013-12-280"XLowerWindow Xlib function
There is no Core resource for stacking order, and therefore it can't
be set with XtSetValues() unless you define the resources in
your own widget class.  Xt provides no call to restack windows; you
must use the Xlib functions XConfigureWindow(),
XRestackWindows(), XRaiseWindow(), or
XLowerWindow().  When a widget suggests a stacking order
for itself through its query_geometry method, Xt takes
care of making the required Xlib call if the parent agrees with
the change.  However, stacking requests of unrealized widgets have no
effect (so stacking order won't be set this way in the initial
geometry negotiation).  Therefore, the most robust method to handle
stacking order is for your composite widget to make the appropriate
Xlib calls directly to change the stacking order of its children.
XRestackWindows() is probably the best call to use.  Since
restacking the windows doesn't change their requirements for screen
space, it shouldn't affect either the parent or the children
adversely.  The appropriate place to call XRestackWindows()
depends on when you want to change the stacking order.
(Note that the stacking change won't become visible until the next
time Xt is waiting for an event.)
ID="IX-1013-12-281" SPAN="END"geometry managementaboutYou can control the initial stacking order of a group of
children by creating them in the desired order.  The most
recently created widget appears on the bottom.  (This is the
opposite of what you might expect if you know that newly
created X windows appears on top of their siblings.  The
difference is due to the way a composite widget maintains its
list of children.)ID="CH-1013-13-1" NUMBER="13"Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded PopupsMenus, Gadgets, and Cascaded PopupsThis chapter begins by describing how to use
Motif Popup and cascaded menus.
Then it describes how menus actually work,
and several ways to create menu widgets.
One of these ways involves the use of windowless
widgets, or gadgets.  This chapter also describes how
to use more advanced features of the Xt pop up
mechanism, including modal cascades, to implement cascading pop
up menus and dialog boxes.ID="IX-1013-13-1"popupsmenusID="IX-1013-13-2"gadgetsaboutID="IX-1013-13-3" SPAN="START"menusaboutID="IX-1013-13-4"widgetswindowlessgadgetsIn Chapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets, we show a simple example that pops up a menu and
a dialog box.  We used Motif's widget creation functions to create
these widgets and we let Motif handle their placement when they were
popped up.  We popped
them up by creating a callback that called XtManageChild().
This chapter continues where Chapter 2 left off by describing how
to create other types of menus, and how to create cascaded menus
and dialog boxes with Motif.Motif, however, is atypical since it hides the actual Xt
mechanisms that support popup widgets.  After describing how
Motif handles popups, this chapter continues by
exploring these underlying mechanisms.  The examples in the second
part of the chapter use the Athena widgets, since they expose Xt's
underlying mechanisms effectively.  Even though Motif hides these
details, it is helpful to understand exactly what is happening
underneath.ID="IX-1013-13-5"popupscascadingID="IX-1013-13-6"cascading popupsabout
This chapter also discusses cascaded popups--popups that call other
popups--and the event management necessary for them to shut
out other input elsewhere in the application and system.Finally, this chapter discusses windowless widgets called gadgets,
which were originally designed to reduce X server memory consumption.
Later improvements in the implementation of windows in the X server
reduce the advantage of gadgets.
Furthermore, gadgets greatly increase the network traffic caused by
an application.  Therefore, they should be avoided.  However, Motif
1.1 and 1.2 still include gadgets for backwards compatibility, so for
completeness they are covered here.
Their most important use is to implement the panes in menu widgets.
As an example of a widget that manages gadgets,
we will show the R4 Athena SimpleMenu widget and its gadget children.Also introduced in R4 is the object, which is another
kind of windowless widget even simpler than a gadget.  Objects
are not usually used in menus, so we will reserve discussion
of them until Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques.
ID="IX-1013-13-7"Release 4 (R4)In this chapter,
we use the term menu broadly to refer
to any user-interface element that lists many options
and allows the user to select one or more.
A menu might consist of a list of commands, only one of which can
be selected at a time, or a list of nonexclusive Boolean settings
that can be turned on or off,
or a list of exclusive choices (such as the colors or patterns
for a paint palette).
A menu that invokes commands will start in the same state each time,
while the other two types may have different contents in any
particular invocation, showing the settings invoked the previous
time or all previous times, or a modified list of choices.Menus are one of the most important user-interface elements
in window-based applications.  They offer the same feature
as push buttons--a way for the user to invoke application
functions or set parameters--but in a more organized and more easily
accessible fashion when there are more than a few buttons.LINKEND="FG-1013-13-1"Figure 13-1 compares a menu to a box full of buttons.ID="FG-1013-13-1"Athena Command widgets in an Athena Box widget, and the same commands as a SimpleMenuFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="13.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-13-1"The menu takes
up less space because only its title is
visible until it is called up.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-1"ID="FN-1013-13-1"Some menus don't even display a
title--they simply pop up at the pointer position in response to
a particular pointer button/keypress combination.  This is the
behavior of the menus provided by xterm and
the system menu of mwm.  However, this is not very desirable
behavior from a user-interface point of view, since it gives the user
no visual feedback that a menu is available or how to invoke it.  The
user needs the manual--something graphical user interfaces are
designed to avoid.
ID="IX-1013-13-8"uwmID="IX-1013-13-9"xterm
As a result, you can have more menus than you could have permanent
button boxes.  Commands can be presented in smaller, more closely related
groups.  The user will spend less time searching for the desired command.The commands in the menu are also easier to read because they are
arranged one per row.  The commands in the menu may even be easier to
invoke because it is more natural to drag the mouse up and down than
from side to side.  And last but not least, menus avoid the
worst problem with button boxes:
when the application is resized, button boxes may
place each command widget in a different position,
making it more difficult for the user to find commands.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-2"ID="FN-1013-13-2" To be fair, there is something to be said for the fact that
all the available commands are always visible in an application that
uses button boxes.  You can invoke a button in a box with just a button
click, while in a menu it requires a press, a drag, and a release.
When there are only a small number of commands,
putting the command widgets in a box is probably better than using a
menu.Some of the applications in the core distribution from MIT use
button boxes instead of menus because there was no menu widget in
the Athena widget set until Release 4.  And some of the applications
ID="IX-1013-13-10"Release 4 (R4)
that do use menus have implemented them directly with Xlib.ID="S1-1013-13-1"Menu Styles and ImplementationThe conventions for the appearance and user interface of menus (look
and feel) in widget sets probably varies more than any other aspect of
the user interface.There are several different styles of menus.  As we've pointed
out earlier, a button box is itself a style of menu.
However, in this chapter we will be focusing on popup
menus--menus that are not visible until the user presses a
pointer button or a key-button combination.ID="IX-1013-13-11"pulldown menuID="IX-1013-13-12"menuspulldown
There are several different styles of popup menu.  Probably the
most familiar is the pulldown menu popularized by the Apple
Macintosh.  A pulldown menu has a label permanently visible
in the application, usually on a menu bar at the top.  When the
pointer is clicked on the label, and then dragged downwards, the
menu is pulled down like a window shade, and remains displayed as
long as the pointer button is depressed.  The currently selected
item (as indicated by the pointer position within the menu) is
highlighted, and is executed when the pointer button is
released.ID="IX-1013-13-13"pulldown menuID="IX-1013-13-14"menuspulldown
The variation adopted by Motif and OPEN LOOK (possibly to
avoid legal entanglements with Apple) is a menu in which
the pointer need not be dragged down to display the menu.
Instead, it appears below the menu title as soon as the button is
depressed in the menu title.  The distinction
between pulldown and drop-down menus is a subtle one.In some cases, selecting an item on the menu or moving off the
right side of certain menu panes causes a second menu
to appear next to the first (usually to the right).  This is
referred to as a cascading menu.  (Another type of
cascading popup is a dialog box that pops up another dialog box.)
ID="IX-1013-13-15"cascading popupsaboutID="IX-1013-13-16"menuscascadedID="IX-1013-13-17"menusspring-loadedFinally, there is the pure spring-loaded popup menu used by many
of the standard X clients, which displays no menu label, and
simply pops up at the pointer position, given the appropriate key
or button press.  For example, the menus in xterm pop up when you
hold the Control key and press the first or second button while
the pointer is anywhere in the xterm window.
Motif calls this type of menu simply a popup menu (as opposed
to pulldown or option menus).  We will refer to these menus
using the term spring-loaded since
the term popup is too generic.One can also imagine many other possible menu styles.
For example,
an effective user interface could be constructed using only horizontal
menus, emulating the single-line menu popularized
by Lotus for its character-based 1-2-3 spreadsheet.  Any given
button might either execute an action, or pop up a lower-level
menu, which would overlay (and thus appear to replace) the first menu.In this chapter, though, we will focus on the two styles of menu
you are most likely to encounter in X applications:  the
pulldown menu and the pure spring-loaded popup menu.In code, the difference between spring-loaded and pulldown
ID="IX-1013-13-18"pulldown menuvs. spring-loadedID="IX-1013-13-19"spring-loaded menuvs. pulldown
menus is primarily the method by which the user invokes the
menu and where the menu is placed; one menu widget class can
usually work in either way.  In Motif, both the pulldown and
popup menu styles are actually RowColumn widgets inside Shell widgets,
but they are popped up in slightly different ways.All the differences described so far concern
user-interface conventions.
The Xt specification, however, classifies popups using a different
criteria--while the menu is popped up, how is input dispatched to
other parts of the application and to other applications?  Also,
is the menu subject to window management?
The three styles are called modeless popups,
modal popups, and spring-loaded popups.ID="IX-1013-13-20"popupsmodelessModeless popups are windows that, once popped up, are subject to
window manager control, and for all intents and purposes act
like regular applications in themselves.  A help window that stayed
up, and could be moved and resized like a regular window once popped
up, is an example of this type of popup.  It is referred to as
"modeless" because it doesn't put the application into a special mode, in which only input to the popup is allowed.ID="IX-1013-13-21"popupsmodalID="IX-1013-13-22"modal popupsID="IX-1013-13-23"modal cascade
A modal popup may or may not be visible to the window manager,
but it always disables user-event processing by the application,
except in the popup itself.  A dialog box that requires the user
to enter data or click on a button is an example of a modal
popup.  Input may still be possible to other
applications.ID="IX-1013-13-24"popupsspring-loadedAs defined by Xt, a spring-loaded popup is invisible to the window
manager and disables user input to all windows in all applications,
except to the popup itself.
The most important
thing about spring-loaded popups is that they are invoked with a
key or pointer button press, whereas another type of popup might
be invoked as a routine part of application processing, or just
because the pointer entered a particular window.
Note that even though the term spring-loaded has been used in two
different contexts above, both actually refer to the same kinds of
widgets.  The first use referred to a characteristic user-interface
style, and the second to a characteristic absence of
window management and disabling of input to other applications.
Throughout this chapter, though, we use the term "spring-loaded popup"to refer to menus that pop up at the pointer position when a mouse
button is pressed, such as that used by xterm, as opposed to
popup or pulldown menus.ID="S1-1013-13-2"Using Motif MenusChapter 3, More Techniques for Using Widgets, showed how to create and use a Motif pulldown menu.
This section demonstrates how to use a Motif popup menu,
and then shows how to implement cascaded menus--menus
that pop up other menus.Volume Six, Motif Programming Manual, will describe more thoroughly how to
use menus, such as how to add mnemonics and accelerators.ID="S2-1013-13-1"Popup MenusUsing a Motif popup menu is really not much different from using
a Motif pulldown menu.  The first difference, obviously, is that
ID="IX-1013-13-25"XmCreatePopupMenu function
you use XmCreatePopupMenu() instead of
XmCreatePulldownMenu().  The most significant difference,
however, is that you are responsible for placing the popup.  As
you may recall, a pulldown menu is automatically positioned just
below the button whose callback invoked the menu.
A popup menu, on the other hand, is usually invoked by a button press
in the custom window or main window of the application.
The menu usually pops up at the pointer position.A popup menu can be popped up in response to a button press in
a particular widget only if the button press does not already have
another meaning in that widget.  For example, a Label widget can
be used as the widget that will detect a button press and pop up
a popup menu, because it doesn't otherwise use button presses for
anything.  Although a PushButton button widget could pop up a popup
menu in its XmNactivateCallback, this would confuse the user
because this callback is normally associated with executing a command.Widgets that don't already use button presses usually don't
have a callback triggered by them.  Therefore, actions or event
handlers are often used to place and to pop up menus.

}The standard way to place a popup menu is to call
XmMenuPosition() just before calling XtManageChild() in
the function that pops up the widget.  This places the popup with
the center of its top edge at the pointer position, but forces the
entire menu on the screen (if part would otherwise extend off the
screen).Note that by default Motif will only pop up a popup menu in response
to mouse button 3.  This can be changed by setting the
XmNmenuPost resource of the popup menu.ID="S2-1013-13-2"Cascaded MenusCascaded menus in Motif are always pulldown menus, regardless of
whether the parent menu is popup or pulldown.
The first step in implementing a submenu is to create it with
ID="IX-1013-13-26"XmCreatePulldownMenu functionXmCreatePulldownMenu().  Next, you create a CascadeButtonWidget
as a child of the main menu, and set its XmNsubMenuId resource
to the ID of the submenu.  Then populate the submenu with gadget
entries and register their callback functions.
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-2"Example 13-2 shows the code needed to add a submenu to

     }

}Note that the submenu is created before the CascadeButtonWidget
that will invoke the submenu.  This makes it possible to set
XmNsubMenuId while creating the CascadeButtonWidget.ID="S1-1013-13-3"Basic Xt Popup SupportAs mentioned above, Motif hides Xt's mechanisms that support popups.
This section exposes these mechanisms by
describing how to create and use a menu using the Athena widgets
in two different menu styles:  spring-loaded and pulldown.
The purpose of this exercise is to expose some of the issues
involved in event management of popups.
Seeing how to do the event management
explicitly should help you to use popups more effectively.The challenge of creating a popup with Box and Command buttons is
to make it pop up and down at the right times, and to control
its event handling to fit the menu style.  We will also
experiment with creating a cascaded menu, in which one menu pane
in a main menu invokes a submenu.Finally, this section describes how to create a menu using the
R4 Athena SimpleMenu widget and its gadget children.ID="S2-1013-13-3"A Spring-loaded Menu: Pointer GrabbingID="IX-1013-13-27"menuspointer grabbingID="IX-1013-13-28"pointergrabsID="IX-1013-13-29"grabspointerID="IX-1013-13-30" SPAN="START"spring-loaded menuID="IX-1013-13-31"menusspring-loadedA spring-loaded menu should pop up when a button press occurs in
a particular widget; usually the application's main window.
The menu should stay visible as long as the user holds down that button,
and disappear when the button is released.  If the button is released
in a menu pane, the function registered for that pane should be
invoked.  If the button is released outside the menu, no function
should be invoked but the menu should still be popped down.ID="IX-1013-13-32"menuspopping downThe only tricky part of implementing a spring-loaded menu is getting
the menu to pop down when the button is released outside the menu.
Since this occurs outside the menu and possibly outside the application,
the X server will not send the button release event to the application unless
a grab is in effect.  Normally, user events are sent to the
window that contains the pointer.  But after an application makes a
grab, the X server sends all events of
particular types to the window that made the grab, even if the
pointer is no longer in the window.
ID="IX-1013-13-33"grabsaboutID="IX-1013-13-34"grabskeyboardThe X server defines several types of grab:  keyboard grabs, pointer
grabs, and server grabs.  Keyboard and pointer grabs control only
input from the indicated device, while server grabs make the server
act on requests from one application exclusively.  (Server grabs
are mainly used by window managers.)  Pointer grabs are used for controlling
events in popups when a pointer button pops up the popup, and
keyboard grabs are used when a key press pops up the popup.
We will discuss pointer grabs since keyboard grabs are analogous (and
keyboard-triggered popups are less common).ID="IX-1013-13-35"grabsactive vs. passiveID="IX-1013-13-36"XtGrabPointerID="IX-1013-13-37"XtUngrabPointer
There are two types of pointer grabs: passive grabs and active grabs.
An active grab is invoked directly with the Xt function
ID="IX-1013-13-38"active grabXtGrabPointer().  This function
tells the server that you want the grab to begin right away and
to continue until specifically released with XtUngrabPointer().
Active grabs are not normally used for popups.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-3"ID="FN-1013-13-3"One reason that XtGrabPointer() is rarely used for popups is
that it requires that the window that will receive the grabbed events
be visible.  This is often not the case.
In a menu, for example, the window that you want
to grab the events may be hidden by the menu panes even when the menu
is popped up.  Another reason is that you need to call
XtUngrabPointer() to release the grab when finished.  Passive
grabs match the task better.A passive grab tells the server that you want a grab to
ID="IX-1013-13-39"passive grab
begin when a certain key or button combination is pressed in
a certain window (the combination that is to pop up the popup).  The
grab continues until the button in the combination is released.
This is perfect for menus because we need the grab only until the
button is released.  (Also, as you'll see in the section on
pulldown menus, you can register several passive grabs for the same
key-button combination as long as each grab is initiated by a press
in a different window.  This technique lets you have as many pulldown
menus as you want.  Since spring-loaded popups are generally
invoked by a press in the same window--the main
window of the application--you will
need to use a different key-button combination for each different
menu.)Passive grabs of a key or button
and active grabs of the pointer or the keyboard we will call
global grabs, since they affect not only this application but
ID="IX-1013-13-40"grabspassiveID="IX-1013-13-41"grabsglobal
prevent distribution of the grabbed events to other applications
running on the same server.  This terminology is to distinguish the global
grab from the effects of Xt's local grab mode,
which simulates a global grab but
requires no call to the server and affects only the
distribution of events within the application.
The Xt grab mode cannot commandeer
events that occur outside the application like a global grab can.
When an Xt grab
is in effect, Xt redirects user events to the popups even if they
occur somewhere else in the application.  (Non-user events continue
to be dispatched to widgets so that they can redraw themselves).The Xt grab mode can be either exclusive or nonexclusive.
Exclusive and nonexclusive Xt grabs differ only when a popup
ID="IX-1013-13-42"grabsexclusive vs. nonexclusive
has popped up another popup--a so-called cascaded popup.
An exclusive Xt grab redirects all user events that occur
within the application to the latest popup in the cascade.  A
nonexclusive Xt grab redirects events to whichever popup the pointer
is in, or the latest popup if the pointer is outside all the popups
(but still in the application).Here are examples of the two kinds of Xt grab modes.  Consider an
application that pops up a dialog box to get a filename
from the user.  The application wants to read the file.
If the file can't be opened, the application pops up another dialog
telling this to the user.  This error popup takes no input, so
input is still desired in the filename entry popup.  This situation
calls for
a nonexclusive grab.  By contrast, consider an application that uses
the same filename entry popup to save a file.  If the file exists,
it would pop up a dialog that would ask whether the existing file
should be overwritten.  This popup must be answered before a new
filename is chosen.  This situation would call for an exclusive grab.
In brief, an exclusive grab constrains input to the
the latest widget in the cascade, while a
nonexclusive grab allows input to any widget in the cascade.
We'll talk more about the Xt grab mode in Section
13.3.3, when we talk about popup cascades.Xt provides three ways of popping widgets up and down:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-13-43"XtCallbackNoneID="IX-1013-13-44"XtCallbackExclusiveID="IX-1013-13-45"XtCallbackNonexclusive
There are three built-in callback functions:  XtCallbackNone(), XtCallbackExclusive(), and
XtCallbackNonexclusive().   Each of these functions pops up
a widget with a different type of Xt grab mode, as indicated by its name.
XtCallbackNone() makes no grab at all.
XtCallbackExclusive() makes an exclusive Xt grab,
while XtCallbackNonexclusive() makes a nonexclusive grab.ID="IX-1013-13-46"XtCallbackPopdownXtCallbackPopdown()
is the corresponding built-in callback function to pop down a widget.ID="IX-1013-13-47"menusXtMenuPopupID="IX-1013-13-48"menusXtMenuPopdownID="IX-1013-13-49"actionsXtMenuPopupID="IX-1013-13-50"actionsXtMenuPopdown
There are two built-in actions,
XtMenuPopup() and XtMenuPopdown(), that pop
up or pop down a widget.  You can use these actions in translation
tables in the app-defaults file or application code.
XtMenuPopup() always asserts an exclusive Xt grab and
a passive global grab if the pointer or keyboard invoked it.ID="IX-1013-13-51"XtPopupID="IX-1013-13-52"XtPopupSpringLoadedID="IX-1013-13-53"XtPopdown
There are three functions,
XtPopup(), XtPopupSpringLoaded(), and XtPopdown(),
that you can call directly in your application code to pop up or pop
down a widget.
XtPopup() has a grab_kind argument that lets you
specify whether to assert an exclusive or nonexclusive grab mode,
or no grab.  XtPopupSpringLoaded() always asserts an
exclusive Xt grab and makes an global pointer grab so that a button
release outside a menu can be used to trigger the popping down of the
menu.Each of these ways is appropriate for different situations, and
they are often used in combination.  Each is described
in the sections below.ID="IX-1013-13-54"XtGrabButtonID="IX-1013-13-55"XtGrabKey
Passive global grabs can be invoked directly using the Xt functions
XtGrabButton() and XtGrabKey().  However,
Xt takes care of making the appropriate passive global grab if you use
XtPopupSpringLoaded() or
ID="IX-1013-13-56"XtPopupSpringLoaded
the XtMenuPopup() action to pop up your shell widget.
As we will see, the other ways to pop up a widget do not
make any global grab, which makes them inappropriate for popping up
main menus.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-4"However, they are still useful for
some types of dialog boxes and for cascading submenus, if the
main menu has used XtMenuPopup() to assert an exclusive grab.
We'll return to this subject in LINKEND="S2-1013-13-5"Section 13.3.3, "Cascaded Menus."ID="FN-1013-13-4"With XtPopupSpringLoaded() you can write callback
functions that are the equivalent of XtCallback*, except that
they will pop up a menu with the necessary passive global grab.
You can also write your own version of the XtMenuPopup() action
if it doesn't do what you want.  You will need
XtRegisterGrabAction() to do this.  This function tells
ID="IX-1013-13-57"XtRegisterGrabAction
Xt to automatically start a passive global grab whenever a certain
action is invoked.ID="IX-1013-13-58"grabsreasons for in menusID="IX-1013-13-59"menuspointer grabbing
A popup menu globally grabs the pointer to force the user to make a menu
choice before leaving the menu, or to pop down the menu if no
choice is made.  However,
this global grab is necessary for another reason as well.  The X server
automatically grabs the pointer beginning at a button press and
ending at the release of the same button.  Since the initial button
press pops up the menu, the next
button release would also arrive at the same widget--the application
main window or the menu title--even if
the pointer were already in the menu.  Furthermore, the
application main window would get all EnterNotify
and LeaveNotify events,
ID="IX-1013-13-60"eventsEnterNotifyID="IX-1013-13-61"EnterNotify eventID="IX-1013-13-62"eventsLeaveNotifyID="IX-1013-13-63"LeaveNotify eventID="IX-1013-13-64" SPAN="START"commandCommand widget
so the Command widgets in the menu wouldn't get any of them.
When the menu is popped up with XtMenuPopup() action, the
passive global grab it makes
cancels the automatic global grab.  (Again, pointer grabs redirect
only the events caused directly by the pointer; ButtonPress,
ButtonRelease, EnterNotify, LeaveNotify, and
MotionNotify.  All other events (most notably Expose
events) occur and are delivered normally.)

provides a spring-loaded menu.  The xmenu1 application's
permanent appearance is a variation of xbox; it displays
a large Label widget that we are using to simulate an application's

a Box widget as its child, and then a series of Label and Command
widgets as children of Box.  The popup shell and the box are

children.Note that this program does not include any code that would pop up the

    <BtnUp>: XtMenuPopdown(pshell)ID="IX-1013-13-89"popupsmenus, spring-loaded using Box widgetThere are a number of settings designed to give the Box widget a
characteristic menu appearance:  all of the Command widgets are forced
to have the same size (rather than the size of their label), and
the Box widget is forced to leave no space between the command
widgets.However, it is the new translations that are
the critical part of this app-defaults file.
The Label widget must be given translations so that
a button press will pop up the widget.  The supplied translation maps a button
press into a call to the application action placeMenu and
then to Xt's predefined XtMenuPopup() action.  The argument to
XtMenuPopup() in the translation is the instance name of the popup
shell.  Xt converts this string name into the widget ID of the
popup shell before it can pop up the widget.
ID="IX-1013-13-90"XtMenuPopupargument toWe are replacing rather
than overriding this
widget's translations because it is a Label widget and has no default
translations.The menu panes are Command widgets, but we need
to adjust their event response so that they will be triggered on a
button release with no corresponding press (since the press that
popped up the menu occurred
in the application main window).  We are replacing their
translations to get rid of the translation for ButtonPress
(which would still be present if we used the #augment
directive, and we would
have to create an action that did nothing in order to replace it
with #override).
The translation for ButtonRelease (abbreviated BtnUp in the
translation table) calls all the actions that usually occur in
Command widgets with both press and release.ID="IX-1013-13-91"menuspopping downPerhaps least obvious is the translation we have added to
pop down the menu when the pointer button is released outside the menu.
As mentioned earlier, Xt makes a passive global pointer grab on the popup shell
(pshell) in the XtMenuPopup() action.
When the pointer is inside the menu,
the Command widgets intercept these grabbed events, because they are
descendants of pshell and they have a translation
for ButtonRelease events.  This invokes the actions in
the selected Command widget.
But when the pointer is outside the menu, the grabbed events
are sent directly to the widget that was specified in the grab call,
namely pshell.
Therefore, the translation to pop down the menu on
button release must be added to pshell.
(Again, this translation table is simply
replaced because the popup shell normally has no translations.)

There is a Command widget or the like permanently visible in the
application, with a label indicating some common characteristic of the
items in the menu.  When a button is pressed in this widget, the
menu should pop up on or just below the button.  Dragging the pointer
down through the menu with the button still held should highlight the
entry that is pointed to.  Releasing the button in an entry should
invoke or set that entry and pop down the menu.  Moving out of the
menu should not change this behavior, except that if the button is
released anywhere outside of a menu pane, the menu should pop down
without executing any entry.
ID="IX-1013-13-95" SPAN="END"commandCommand widgetIf you compile and run xmenu2 you can try out this style of
menu.  The appearance of this application is shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-13-3"Figure 13-3.ID="FG-1013-13-3"xmenu2: a pulldown menuFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="13.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-13-3"Invoking a menu as a pulldown is a simple enhancement of the
spring-loaded invocation method just shown.  We can do
everything exactly the same as in the spring-loaded example, except
that a pulldown menu should appear just below the pressme
widget, not at the position of the pointer.
Therefore, all we need to change is
the placement code.  However, since the coordinates in the event are
not necessary for placing the popups, we can use a callback function
instead of an action to place the popup.
(In general, it is better to use an
existing callback than to add an action to do the same thing.)Popup shell widgets have XtNpopupCallback and
XtNpopdownCallback callback resources;
the functions on these callback lists are called whenever the popup
is popped up or down using any of the Xt mechanisms.In the last example we created an action called PlaceMenu,
that moves the popup shell before it was actually popped up.
We included it in a translation along
with the standard action XtMenuPopup(),
which was actually used to pop up the widget.

pop up the widget, but it uses the XtNpopupCallback resource to provide the code to place
the widget.  Using the callback saves having to reference the placement action in the
translation table.   This is preferable, since the placement code should almost
always be hardcoded rather than user-configurable.
Another advantage of the popup and popdown callbacks is that you
may arrange for a popup to be popped up or down in more than one way,
and it may be convenient to have certain code called automatically in
all cases.(You can also use the XtNpopupCallback resource to specify a
callback function to create a popup widget the first time
it is popped up, instead of at application startup.
The one problem is that
the functions on the callback list are invoked every time the widget is
popped up.  To make sure that your function callback creates the popup only once (the first time),
the callback function should remove itself
from the callback list by calling XtRemoveCallback().)
ID="IX-1013-13-102"XtRemoveCallbackThere is not enough difference between xmenu1 and xmenu2
to merit showing the complete code.  All we have done is
changed the PlaceMenu function from an action into a callback
and changed its placement logic to place the popup relative to the
invoking Command widget.  We have then modified the app-defaults file
accordingly.

Incidentally, XTranslateCoordinates(), the Xlib
equivalent of XtTranslateCoords(), gets the same information and
a little more by querying the server.  XtTranslatCoords does
not have to make a server request because Xt stores this data
locally.  Each time a window
in this application is moved, Xt receives this information
as an event and updates its knowledge of the position of each window.
This is an important optimization, because server queries are subject to
network delays and tend to slow applications.LINKEND="EX-1013-13-6"Example 13-6 shows the

only in that pressme is a Command widget, which already
has its own translation table, rather than a widget without
existing translations such as Label (which we used as a fake
main window).
We have modified the translations of pressme
to be suitable for this use.  Note that the translation no longer
calls PlaceMenu as an action because it is now a callback.ID="IX-1013-13-117"commandCommand widgetThe translations for the menu pane Command widgets are also somewhat
different from xmenu1, but only for cosmetic reasons.  This
iteration of the xmenu example
uses the set and unset actions instead
of highlight and reset or unhighlight to
make the Command widgets highlight their entire box instead of
just an area near the border.  (Although this modification makes
the menu look more like a typical menu, it also seems to make it
slower.)To create several menus you simply need to replicate the code shown
here, changing the variable names for each menu.  The passive global
grabs
invoked by Xt for each menu do not interfere with each other even if
they specify the same key/button combination, because they specify
different windows in which the key/button combination will begin the grab.It is sometimes useful to be able to get a list of children in
a menu, especially if you add and subtract menu entries.  You
can do this by querying the XtNchildren and
XtNnumChildren resources of the parent.  The value of
XtNchildren is a list of the widget ID's of the
children.  This technique allows you to eliminate maintaining
global variables for every pane of every menu.ID="S2-1013-13-5"Cascaded MenusID="IX-1013-13-118" SPAN="START"cascading popupsaboutID="IX-1013-13-119" SPAN="START"menuscascadedA cascaded menu is a menu in which one or more panes do not invoke
functions but instead bring up additional menus.The techniques used to bring up cascaded menus can also be used
to have dialog boxes bring up
other dialog boxes.  However,
cascaded menus are more challenging because they rely on
the passive
global pointer grab to receive the ButtonRelease event that occurs
outside the menu and application.You can implement a cascaded menu the same way for both spring-loaded
and pulldown menus simply by adding to the code we've already
written to implement a single menu.  We'll show you xmenu5, the
spring-loaded version, since it is slightly shorter.
(xmenu4 is the equivalent pulldown version.)
Both are included in the example source code.
In this example, only one menu pane will be
used to invoke a submenu.  However, this technique can be
generalized to have additional panes bring up additional submenus.First, let's describe exactly how we expect the cascaded menu to work.
LINKEND="FG-1013-13-4"Figure 13-4 shows both menus popped up.  (Compile the program
and try it.)ID="FG-1013-13-4"xmenu5: cascaded spring-loaded menusFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="13.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-13-4"The main menu works as described above.  However, one of the
panes--the one that brings up the submenu--has an arrow pointing
to the right after its label.  This pane does not highlight itself
when the pointer moves inside (telling the user that this pane is
different).  Instead, when the user moves the pointer out through
the right edge of the pane, the submenu pops up.  The submenu
ID="IX-1013-13-120"submenuspopping up
operates just like the main menu.  When the button is released inside
either menu, the callback function associated with the chosen
pane will be invoked.  When the
button is released outside of either menu, both menus pop down.
If the pointer is moved back out of the submenu into the main menu,
only the submenu pops down.To create the submenu, we create a new popup shell, Box widget, and
ID="IX-1013-13-121"submenuscreating
a set of Command widgets, and add callbacks for each function the
submenu panes will invoke (in this example, one common callback).  Then
we write three actions:
PlaceMenu (which you have already seen),
CheckRightAndPopupSubmenu (which places and pops up the
submenu if the pointer leaves the main menu pane through its right
side), and PopdownSubmenu (which pops down the
submenu if the pointer leaves the submenu).  These actions are shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-7"Example 13-7.

}ID="IX-1013-13-123"cascading popupsexampleAs usual, the app-defaults file specifies which events
trigger these actions.  We'll show this file in a moment, but for
now you need to know just that CheckRightAndPopupSubmenu and
PopdownSubmenu are triggered by LeaveNotify
events.  We want the submenu to pop up and down only when
the pointer leaves through certain parts of certain sides of the
widget--the entire right side of a pane for popping it up, and the part
of the submenu
touching the main menu on the left side for popping it down.
These two actions are called in response to all LeaveNotify
events, and they check if the pointer left through the correct parts
before popping up and down the submenu.As you may recall, we mentioned earlier that no
matter what the arguments, XtPopup() and all other Xt
facilities for grabbing, except XtMenuPopup() and
XtPopupSpringLoaded(), make no
passive global grab, and therefore can't be used for spring-loaded or
pulldown main menus.  It turns out
that for submenus the opposite is true--XtPopup() and
XtCallback* work fine, but XtMenuPopup() is
inappropriate because no new passive grab is needed.  The original
grab directs events normally to all widgets in the application,
including the submenu, and directs all events that occur outside the
ID="IX-1013-13-124"submenusXtPopup
application to pshell.ID="IX-1013-13-125"grabsexclusive vs. nonexclusiveThe CheckRightAndPopupSubmenu action calls XtPopup() with
a grab mode of XtGrabNonexclusive.  This grab mode controls
Xt's event dispatching within the application--it has
nothing to do with the passive global grab that Xt makes from the
XtMenuPopup() action.  XtGrabNonexclusive means that widgets
in the cascade but outside of the submenu will continue to get
events normally.
The grab mode specified in the call to XtPopup(),
or specified by the standard popup callback function selected
(XtCallbackExclusive() or XtCallbackNonexclusive())
merely control the event dispatching within the application.
ID="IX-1013-13-126"XtPopupID="IX-1013-13-127"grabsgrab modesAs an exercise, you may want to modify the example so that
CheckRightAndPopupSubmenu calls XtPopup() with
a grab mode of XtGrabExclusive, and see how the menus
work as a result.  The XtGrabExclusive
mode means that only the most recent popup popped up will get events,
while XtGrabNonexclusive means that all popups in a popped-up
cascade will get events.  In this case,
when the submenu is popped up, it alone will get pointer events if
you use grab mode
XtGrabExclusive, while both it and the main menu will get
pointer events if you use grab mode XtGrabNonexclusive.  Because
of the logic that pops down the submenu when the pointer leaves it
through the portion adjoining the main menu, you can see this
difference only if you move out through another part of the submenu
and then around into the main menu again.  (In the example code
distribution, xmenu5.c uses XtGrabNonexclusive and
xmenu4.c uses XtGrabExclusive, so that you can
compare the results of these two flags.)The user-interface conventions for a particular widget set usually
specify which kinds of popups should have exclusive grabs and
which nonexclusive.  Note that the effect of these two grab
modes is the same unless there is more than one popup widget in
a cascade visible.CheckRightAndPopupSubmenu places the submenu itself (instead
of using a separate action) because
the menu should be placed only when it is first popped up.  If the
placement code were a separate action, it would be called every time a
LeaveWindow event arrived, even if not through the correct
ID="IX-1013-13-128"LeaveWindow event
border of the widget.  (Remember that this code is in an
action rather than a callback because it uses the contents of the
event.)The translation portion of the app-defaults file for
xmenu5 is shown in

ID="IX-1013-13-129"commandCommand widget
and making the menu Command widgets work as expected.
We've seen these in previous examples.The translation table for pshell pops down one or both menus;
no error or warning is caused if only the main menu is up.
This translation table works because the button release is sent
to pshell if it occurs outside a menu regardless of whether
just the main menu or both menus are up.In this case, menu pane 5 is the pane that will pop up the
submenu.  The label for this pane is shown at the top of
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-8"Example 13-8.
The translation for this pane replaces all the normal
translations for highlighting and notifying with a single translation
for LeaveWindow events.  These events in this widget trigger
the CheckRightAndPopupSubmenu action which has already been
described.The translations for the subbox widget invoke
PopdownSubmenu action to check whether
the pointer left the submenu.  In this
case, the submenu is popped down, but the original popup remains
visible.
ID="IX-1013-13-130"menuspopping downID="IX-1013-13-131"submenuscascadingThe pane that will pop up the submenu and its event handling
characteristics is controlled from the app-defaults file.
Therefore, it may seem like you can change which menu pane invokes
the submenu simply by changing the app-defaults file.
This is true here, because the menu actions are nonfunctional
and simply call a common callback.  But it would not be possible if
each pane invoked its own callback.  To give the user the freedom
to rearrange the menu, you would have to use actions instead of
callbacks.ID="IX-1013-13-132"acceleratorsfor menusID="IX-1013-13-133"menusaccelerators in
Note that you can define accelerators for any of the menus shown up
to this point simply by placing settings for the XtNaccelerators
resource in the app-defaults
file.  You would set this resource for every Command widget in the
menus.  This provides keyboard shortcuts for
popping up the menu and choosing a pane.  However, remember to make
sure that each key combination is unique.For completeness, here are some rules that apply when multiple
cascaded popups are invoked with specified grab modes.MARK="BULLET"When a grab is removed, all grabs added after that one are also removed.When a shell is popped up with XtGrabExclusive or

R4 supplies three types of panes to be used with the SimpleMenu
widget:  SmeBSB (an entry composed of a bitmap, a string, and another
bitmap), SmeLine (a horizontal line between entries), and Sme (a blank
entry).  The SimpleMenu widget is itself a subclass of the popup
shell widget, and therefore no separate popup shell needs to be created.ID="IX-1013-13-142"Athena widgetsMenuButton widgetR4 also provides a MenuButton widget, which
is a subclass of Command with built-in placement and popup code.
Using a MenuButton to invoke a menu makes it even simpler to
implement a pulldown menu, since the popup and placement code
can be eliminated from the application.The xmenu7 application shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-9"Example 13-9 creates a SimpleMenu
widget with panes of all three types.  The menu is invoked
in pulldown style using the R4 MenuButton widget.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-7"ID="FN-1013-13-7"This example was written by Chris Peterson of MIT Project
Athena and modified only slightly by the authors.As an additional enhancement,
the menu marks or unmarks each item when it is selected

Accelerators can be defined for menus with gadget children, but
not in the usual sense.  They cannot be defined to invoke the
actions of the gadget children, but they can invoke global
application actions, which for menus is usually good enough.
For example, in the R4 xmh, one item on one of the menus
incorporates new mail.  From the widget, the notify action
of the menu pane gadget calls the DoIncorporateNewMail
callback function.  The XtNaccelerators resource for the
SimpleMenu widget itself (not the gadgets) maps a Meta-I
key event into a call to the XmhIncorporateNewMail global
action.  XmhIncorporateNewMail then calls
DoIncorporateNewMail.  This use of accelerators depends
on having both a callback and an action form of each
function.
ID="IX-1013-13-149" SPAN="END"SimpleMenu widgetID="S2-1013-13-7"Delayed Popup CreationAs we've seen, a popup may consist of a single widget, or it may
be a shell widget which contains a composite widget which contains
a number of children.  In the latter case, creating all those widgets
(or gadgets) takes time.  It may be beneficial to create those widgets using idle
time in the application instead of delaying startup.  In either
case, it may make sense to create the popup only when it is needed,
to minimize wasted resources.If your goal is to speed startup, and you want all
menus created even if some are never used, you can register a work
procedure to create each popup, as described in Section 8.5.
As you may recall, a work procedure uses idle time in the application
to call a function, which must return swiftly.  If you use this
technique, you add one work procedure for each popup you need to
create, and you need to add code to make sure that the popup has been
created before the user is allowed to use it.If your goal is to create only the required popups, you can
create the popup in a callback function or action routine that you
have registered to place or pop up the popup.  In this case, you
would have a static variable in the callback or action to make sure
that the popup widgets are only created the first time the popup is
popped up.  You need to have created the popup shell before this
can work.There is also another way to create only the required popups.
ID="IX-1013-13-150"XtCreatePopupChildProcID="IX-1013-13-151"XtNcreatePopupChildProc resource
Shell widgets have an XtNcreatePopupChildProc resource
which you can set to a function that creates the Shell's children.
See XtCreatePopupChildProc(2) in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, for the calling
sequence of this function type.
The Xt specification does not say whether an
XtCreatePopupChildProc is called just once
when the shell is first popped up or every time it is popped up.
But the MIT implementation of Xt calls it every time the shell is
popped up, so you will again need a static variable to make sure
the children are only created once.ID="S1-1013-13-4"About Dialog BoxesID="IX-1013-13-152"XtSetSensitiveID="IX-1013-13-153"dialog boxesAlthough we have been talking so far exclusively about menus,
much that has been said is also true of dialog boxes.
Both menus and dialog boxes that get user input usually need to
get that input before other application functions can be invoked.
Of course, one way to disable all other application functions is to
make all other widgets insensitive with XtSetSensitive()
(passing it False).  Setting the sensitivity of one common
ancestor does this efficiently,
but even this is too slow because all the widgets redraw
themselves dimmed or grayed.  It is much faster to use
a global grab.   Unlike menus, which require the global grab in order
to get button release events outside the application so they can pop
down properly, dialog boxes do not, strictly speaking, need a grab.
But they sometimes
make the grab anyway to disable other application functions.
ID="IX-1013-13-154"dialog boxesID="IX-1013-13-155"dialog boxescascadingID="IX-1013-13-156"dialog boxesgrabs inID="IX-1013-13-157"grabsin dialog boxesID="IX-1013-13-158"dialog boxeswithout grabsDialog boxes can also invoke other dialog boxes.  For example, a dialog
box that gets input might check the validity of the input before popping
down the dialog, and if incorrect, pop up a message telling the user the
problem with the input.  Cascaded dialog boxes are implemented the
same way as cascaded menus.  Note that, as a general rule, sub-dialog
boxes are popped up with grab mode XtGrabExclusive, which
means that the user must satisfy the most deeply nested dialog
first.  However, it is often desirable to leave a Help dialog on
the screen until after the dialog it provides help for has been
removed.Some popups do not need to disable other application functions.
For example, imagine a dialog box that informed the user of some
fact without requiring confirmation.  This kind of popup would be
popped up with grab mode XtGrabNone, allowing the user
to continue with other application functions.
ID="IX-1013-13-159"XtGrabNone grab modeWe pointed out earlier that the built-in callback functions
for popping up a widget are not useful for menus because they
make no passive global pointer grab.  However, they come in handy for dialog
boxes.  The functions XtCallbackNone(),
XtCallbackExclusive(), and XtCallbackNonexclusive()
can be used to pop up dialog boxes, as long as the position of the
dialog box need not depend on information in an event.We haven't shown how to use Xt's standard callback for popping
down a widget:  XtCallbackPopdown().
Instead of calling XtPopdown() in the callback functions for
each menu entry, we can add XtCallbackPopdown() to the
callback list after the existing callback function.
XtCallbackPopdown() requires an XtPopdownId
structure to be passed
as the client_data argument.  This structure must contain the
popup shell and the widget that invoked the popup (the MenuButton or
Command widget).All three of the standard popup callbacks set the invoking widget to
insensitive mode before popping up the widget.
XtCallbackPopdown() resets the invoking widget to sensitive mode.
Therefore, if you use XtCallbackNone(),
XtCallbackNonexclusive(), or
XtCallbackExclusive() without also using
XtCallbackPopdown(),
remember to set the widget to sensitive mode yourself.  This
feature is useless but also harmless when the popup is spring-loaded,
because the invoking widget is often the main application window and
that widget rarely responds to sensitivity.

In certain rare cases, you may want to use XtAddGrab() and
XtRemoveGrab() directly to append a widget to or remove a
widget from the current popup cascade.  These functions are called
internally by the Xt facilities that pop widgets up and down, and should not be
necessary on their own.  Note that these functions never make a
request to the server to start or release a passive global pointer
grab--they affect only Xt's internal event dispatching.
(However, the functions XtGrabKey(), XtGrabKeyboard(),
XtGrabButton(), and XtGrabPointer() do initiate
global grabs.  These functions are described in Chapter 14, Miscellaneous Toolkit Programming Techniques.)ID="S1-1013-13-5"GadgetsID="IX-1013-13-165" SPAN="START"gadgetsaboutID="IX-1013-13-166"gadgetsreason forWhen an application includes many different menus with many fields
each, the server memory consumption of having separate widgets for
every menu pane was once thought to be a problem.  So the window-less
widget, called a gadget, was invented.  A gadget depends on
special behavior of its parent to get events and operate much like
a widget.  (Gadgets also consume slightly less client-side memory.)Now that the
server implementation has been improved, the memory consumption of a
window is much less significant now.
In fact, the use of Motif Button gadgets in particular greatly increases
network traffic during the crucial user-interaction phase of
the application.  This is because the Motif Button gadget parent
requires MotionNotify events to track whether the pointer has
entered or left a gadget (since gadgets have no window to cause
EnterNotify events).  These MotionNotify events allow
the gadget to highlight its border when the pointer enters, just like
a regular widget.  A gadget is fully configurable using the
resource database just like a widget, and can have its own callback
list.This network traffic problem is much more serious
than the memory problem gadgets were originally thought to improve.
Therefore, gadgets should be avoided in uses where they cause this
problem.Gadgets also have other limitations.
Gadgets have to draw on their parent's window, and they share this
space with the parent and with all other gadget children.  The gadgets
and the parent must agree to draw in certain areas only.  For this
reason, gadgets must be used with a special composite widget parent
that is prepared to manage them properly.
ID="IX-1013-13-167"gadgetsdrawbacks ofThe Athena SimpleMenu widget is such a parent.  It is a composite
widget designed to manage gadget children.  The gadgets provided by
are Sme, SmeBSB, and SmeLine (where Sme stands for Simple
Menu Entry).  These provide
a blank entry (and generic menu entry superclass), an entry which can
contain a bitmap, a string, and another bitmap (thus BSB), and an
entry that draws a horizontal
line.  We will use and describe this widget and these gadgets both to
show how menu widgets are built and to demonstrate how the parent and
the gadgets work together.
ID="IX-1013-13-168"gadgetscomposite parentID="IX-1013-13-169"gadgetsevent handling inGadgets do not handle events
automatically as widgets do,
and because they have no windows,
the server does not handle overlapping between them.
This places certain demands on the parent.
All the gadgets that are children of a particular
parent share that parent's window.  The parent is responsible for
coordinating the gadget children, telling them about events by calling
their functions.  Therefore, the composite
widget that manages a group of gadgets must be
specially designed for that purpose, not a general-purpose
composite or constraint widget such as Box or Form.  It is possible
for a composite widget to manage both gadget and widget children,
but its code has to be more involved to do this.Like normal widgets, gadgets provide their own code to redraw
themselves in their expose method.  However, since gadgets do
ID="IX-1013-13-170"exposemethod; in gadgets
not receive events, they depend on the parent to directly call their
expose method.  The parent keeps track of the geometry of
each child, and when the parent's expose method is called, this
method calculates whether the area exposed overlaps any of the gadget
children.  If the area exposed does overlap a gadget, the parent's
expose method calls that gadget's expose method, which
redraws the area.

A gadget's actions also have to work differently from widget actions
because of the fact that gadgets don't get events.  A gadget defines
its actions as methods--as fields in its class part structure--instead
of in an action list and translation table.  It initializes these
fields directly to pointers to functions during class
initialization.  The parent widget has corresponding actions
that are defined and operate like normal actions, except that
they determine which gadget the event that invoked the action occurred
in and call the gadget method corresponding to that action.
In other words, the parent has actions that operate the gadget children.ID="IX-1013-13-177"acceleratorsnot usable in gadgetsID="IX-1013-13-178"gadgetsaccelerators; not usable
One weakness of a menu composed of gadget panes is that
gadgets cannot have an accelerator table.
Therefore, accelerators cannot be used to provide a keyboard equivalent that
would invoke each menu pane.The parent of gadgets has to position the gadget children so that they
do not overlap, or take care of the consequences if they do overlap.
Since the gadgets draw on the parent's window,
if they did overlap they would draw over each other's graphics,
with unpredictable results.
The parent would have to calculate the area of overlap between two
gadgets, and clear this area before letting one of the gadgets draw itself.
(A gadget could clear its own area before drawing, but this would
be unnecessary in many cases, and would cause flashing.)ID="IX-1013-13-179"RectObjID="IX-1013-13-180"gadgetsclass hierarchy
Gadgets are subclasses of RectObj, one of the invisible superclasses
of Core that we have so far ignored because for widgets it is safe

is intentionally undocumented in the Xt specification so that its
characteristics can be changed in later releases without
compatibility problems.  You should never create subclasses

ID="IX-1013-13-184"superclassof Core
do not play by all the rules we have
described in Chapter 6, Inside a Widget.  For one thing, each
shares what we call
the Core class structure instead of adding its own part structure.
Applications are never intended to create instances of these
superclasses--they are really just part of the implementation of
Xt.  Instead of developing all the characteristics of widgets in
one large base class Core, it made more sense to implement Xt in
object-oriented fashion by dividing the implementation into
separate pseudo-classes.  It is important to know what each early class
defines simply so that you know what characteristics are available in
gadgets and which are available only in widgets.  Each class
defines the following features:MARK="BULLET"Object defines only the XtNdestroyCallback resource and the
underlying support for callbacks in general.ID="IX-1013-13-185"objectsObject classID="IX-1013-13-186"RectObjRectObj defines the geometry resources (XtNx, XtNy,
XtNwidth, XtNheight, and
XtNborder_width) and the resources that control
sensitivity:  XtNancestorSensitive and XtNsensitive.
RectObj itself doesn't use the sensitivity resources.
They are provided at this level in the hierarchy
so that sensitivity can be set for gadgets.
Gadgets draw themselves according to these
resources (gray if insensitive), and
check these resources in their action routines (stored in their
class part methods), invoking their callback function only if
sensitive.ID="IX-1013-13-187"windowunnamed classThe unnamed class (WindowObj) adds many window-oriented resources:
ones that control window attributes such as the background pixmap,
permanent window
features such as the window depth, and event resources such as
translations and accelerators.  It also includes the
XtNmappedWhenManaged resource.
This class is known as the unnamed class because it
never appears in widget, gadget, or application code.  Widgets
are subclassed from Core, while gadgets are subclassed from RectObj.
The exact features of unnamed class are subject to change and should
not be relied upon.ID="IX-1013-13-188"classhierarchy; gadgetsID="IX-1013-13-189"gadgetsclass hierarchyThe Core class structure actually is inherited all the way from
RectObj.  Therefore, the class structure in gadgets is the Core class
structure you are already familiar with.  All the event-related
fields in the Core class part structure of gadgets are unused.
The only exception is the expose method, which
is present, but draws on the parent's window and is not
called in the usual way by Xt because the gadget receives no events.
The remaining non-event-related fields have the same purpose as for
widgets, including all the remaining methods.

a gadget parent.ID="S2-1013-13-8"Inside a GadgetID="IX-1013-13-192" SPAN="START"gadgetsinternalsMany portions of a gadget's code are exactly the same as those of a
widget, as
described in Chapter 6, Inside a Widget.  This section
summarizes the parts that are identical so that you know that
nothing is left out, and describes the differences in detail.The code for gadgets and widgets includes the same three
implementation files with the same naming conventions.
As in Chapter 6, we'll take the three implementation files one at a time, beginning with the private header file, then the code file,
and then the public header file.ID="IX-1013-13-193"conventionsgadget internalsAs in widget code, many of the conventions described here are
automatically taken care of for you when you are writing a new gadget
if you copy all three files of an
existing gadget and then globally change the gadget class name.The Athena menu pane gadgets are implemented in two class levels:MARK="BULLET"Sme (Simple Menu Entry) defines the callback for an entry, the actions to highlight,
unhighlight, and notify, and the code that allows
subclasses to inherit or replace these actions (because they are
defined as methods).  The actual functions for highlight and unhighlight
are empty, while the notify action calls the callback.
The expose method of this gadget is also empty.
This gadget can be used by itself to create a blank entry.SmeBSB and SmeLine are each subclasses of Sme.  SmeLine
replaces only the expose method of its superclass.
SmeBSB replaces both the expose method and the
highlight and unhighlight actions of the superclass.
(Sme can be subclassed to create new types of menu entries.)The following sections describe both Sme and SmeBSB.ID="S2-1013-13-9"Private Header FileID="IX-1013-13-194"gadgetsprivate header fileThe private header file for a gadget is identical in format to the
private header file for a widget.  It defines a class part structure for
this class of gadget and then a complete class structure including
the class parts of superclasses and this class.  The only
difference is that a gadget inherits its features from Object and
RectObj, whereas a widget inherits from Core.
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-11"Example 13-11 shows the complete class structure of the R4 Athena Sme gadget.

the class part for the Object class, even though it is a superclass.
This is because all the superclasses of Core share the same
class part structure.The class part structure for Sme defines three methods--these
are essentially the gadget's actions, but they will be invoked by
the gadget parent's actions, not directly by Xt.
The extension field allows fields to be added to this
structure in a future version while retaining binary compatibility.
In a future version this field could be changed to point to an
extension structure.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-9"ID="FN-1013-13-9"Note that the extension field is defined as type
XtPointer.  In R4, all occurrences of caddr_t
have been replaced with XtPointer.  On most systems,
XtPointer will be defined to be caddr_t.  But for
some architectures, caddr_t is too small to hold a
pointer to a function.  On such systems, XtPointer will
be defined to be larger.  The caddr_t type will continue
to work on most systems, but you are advised to use
XtPointer instead for maximum portability.
ID="IX-1013-13-197"XtPointerID="IX-1013-13-198"portabilityAny class that defines methods must provide code to allow them to
be inherited or replaced by subclasses.  The Sme class
therefore must define the XtInherit constants that allow the methods
to be inherited.  The .c code file provides the
class_part_init method that allows them to be
replaced.  (See LINKEND="S2-1013-12-17"Section 12.4.5, "The class_part_init Method.")In the private header file for SmeBSB, the class part structure

in the class structure initialization is rectObjClassRec,

for a gadget where it would have been SmeWidget if the entry

you cast the pointer to the instance structure before accessing the

used in a widget are never used in gadgets.  The following is

XtInheritSetValuesAlmost.

There are, however, slight differences in the code for certain gadget
methods.  The expose method checks not
only its own sensitivity but also its parent's sensitivity before
deciding whether to draw the entry in normal colors or grayed.
When creating GCs using XCreateGC() or creating any other server
resources from the
initialize method using an Xlib call, you must remember
to use the parent's window, since the gadget has no window.
(XtWindow() is not smart enough to give you the parent's
window ID in the case of gadgets.)
Also, the parent's resource values, such as background_pixel,
may be used to provide data in common among all instances of a
subclass like SmeBSB.

children.  Gadget parents perform all the geometry management tasks
that all composite widgets perform, which are described in Chapter 12, Geometry Management.
Gadgets also
follow all the rules of normal widget children.
However, gadget parents also have the added responsibility of managing
the overlap of gadgets or making sure they don't overlap, and of
handling events for the gadgets and calling gadget code.
This section describes the gadget-managing role of the gadget
parent.The Athena SimpleMenu widget is designed to manage the gadget
children already described, Sme, SmeLine, and SmeBSB
(and any other subclass of Sme that is written later).
It forms a vertical menu with horizontal panes.
It is quite a large widget because it contains all the geometry
management code in addition to code for managing events for
the gadgets.
We'll concentrate just on the code that manages events for the
gadgets, since the geometry management code is described in
Chapter 12, Geometry Management.Let's begin with the expose method.  SimpleMenu's expose
method does no drawing of its own.  It simply calls the expose
methods of the gadget children.  However,  it compares the region
passed into its expose method to determine which gadgets need
redrawing.
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-13"Example 13-13 shows SimpleMenu's expose method.

widget code (specifically, from the resize and
geometry_manager methods) to redraw the gadgets.
In these cases, the region passed
in is set to NULL, and the method clears its window and redraws all the
gadgets.
ID="IX-1013-13-241"regionsAlso note how this expose method invokes the
expose methods of its children.  All expose methods
(and in fact all methods)
are stored in the class structure, not the instance structure.
Composite widgets keep only a list of the instance structures
of their children.  However, one field in each instance structure
points to the class structure for that child.  This is the
widget_class field of the Object instance part.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-10"ID="FN-1013-13-10"The Core instance part structure (not complete) is the concatenation
of the instance parts of the three superclasses Object, RectObj,
and the unnamed class.  Therefore, it also includes a widget_class
field.  Since composite widgets do not normally need to invoke the
methods of their children, you shouldn't need to access this field.
In this example, the entry counter variable is a pointer to
the gadget ID (opaque pointer to the instance structure) of one of the
children.  Another variable, class, declared as a pointer to
the SmeObjectClass class structure (the expected class of
the children), is set to the widget_class field in the instance
structure of one of the children.  Then the expose field of
this class structure is checked to see if it is NULL, and if not it
is invoked.Note that the class of the children is hardcoded in this method.
This widget can manage only Sme widgets and its subclasses.The resize method of SimpleMenu must resize the children
when it is resized itself.  (Actually, this is unlikely,
since the SimpleMenu widget itself is a subclass of Shell and
is therefore not managed by any parent.)  This method
is invoked only when the user resizes the menu using the window
manager.  Since this widget has the authority to determine the
geometry of its children, it can simply resize them.
This particular resize method (shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-14"Example 13-14) simply
sets their width to be the same as its own.

}ID="IX-1013-13-245"methodsresize; in gadget parentID="IX-1013-13-246"methodsresize; in gadget parentNotice that this resize method invokes the expose
method (Redisplay) because the gadgets
don't have resize methods, and
will not redraw themselves in response to their size change.LINKEND="FN-1013-13-11"ID="FN-1013-13-11"The gadget children could have resize methods, and this
resize method could call the children's resize methods.
The gadget's resize methods would simply call their
expose method.  However, this does exactly the same thing
as the code shown while being more complicated.Now let's look at SimpleMenu's actions.  Their only purpose is to
call the gadgets' actions when the appropriate events arrive.
These actions are added in the usual way:  they are declared at the top of
the .c file, then registered with an action list that is
entered into the class structure initialization, and then defined.
One of the three actions is shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-13-15"Example 13-15.

if so, calls the notify method of that gadget.  As described
above in the section on the gadget children, gadgets define their
actions as methods so that they can conveniently be called by
their parent.
Since these methods are stored in the class structure not
the instance structure, this is done using the technique described
above for the expose method.Although not critical to its handling of gadgets, SimpleMenu
does one more interesting thing.  It registers the
PositionMenuAction action in the global application action
list (as opposed to the internal widget action list) so that the
application or app-defaults file can refer to this action in
translation tables without needing to register the action.
This action can be triggered by any type of event in the widget
and positions the menu according to data in the event type.
(SimpleMenu has a resource that controls whether this placement
process makes sure that the menu is not off the screen.)A widget can add an action to the global action list by calling
XtAddAction() just like an
application would, but from its class_initialize method.

describes various Xt functions that have not been treated
elsewhere in the book.This chapter discusses various Xt facilities that didn't
fit neatly into any other chapter.
Many of them
are functions provided mostly because Xt uses them internally, and they
are unlikely to be useful in application or widget
code.
Some of them are quite
important for accomplishing certain tasks.
You should scan the contents of this chapter to familiarize
yourself with these facilities so that you will be aware of them.The topics covered are errors and warning messages, objects, a
description of all of Xt's macros and functions for getting
information, the Core accept_focus method,
how to interpret key events, Xt's facilities for memory management,
making global grabs, file finding and internationalization, multiple
application contexts, multiple top-level shells, and connecting to
multiple servers.ID="S1-1013-14-1"Errors and WarningsID="IX-1013-14-1" SPAN="START"registeringfatal error handlersID="IX-1013-14-2" SPAN="START"registeringnonfatal error handlersID="IX-1013-14-3" SPAN="START"registeringactionsactionsID="IX-1013-14-4" SPAN="START"error handlingID="IX-1013-14-5"warningserror handlingThere are several broad categories of errors that may occur in Xt applications.
One is the X server error, which is a form of event that tells
the client that some parameter in an earlier request was illegal,
or that no more server memory is available.
A second is the connection failure error generated by Xlib when the
connection with the server fails (usually due to a system crash or
network interruption).  Xlib provides the XSetErrorHandler() and
XSetIOErrorHandler() functions to allow the application to
provide a routine to handle these two types of
errors.  Xt provides no interface to these routines--Toolkit
applications must use the Xlib routines to customize these error
handlers (Xlib uses default error handlers when the application
does not use these routines to specify them).  For a description of
these error handlers and the routines for changing them, see Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.
ID="IX-1013-14-6"XSetErrorHandler Xlib functionID="IX-1013-14-7"XSetIOErrorHandler Xlib functionA third category is made up of error and warning messages that
Xt reports when function parameters are specified improperly,
when a translation is incorrectly specified, and for many other
reasons.  For a complete listing of all errors and warnings that can
be generated by Xt, see Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, Appendix D, Standard Errors and Warnings.  Xt provides separate parallel routines for errors and
for warnings.  The difference between Xt errors and Xt warnings is that
errors are fatal and the application exits after printing the error,
while warnings are nonfatal and the application continues.
The main purpose of these facilities is to generate consistent messages.Two levels of interface are provided:MARK="BULLET"A high-level interface that takes an error name and class and looks
the error up in an error resource database.  The high-level fatal
error handler is invoked by a call to
XtAppErrorMsg(); the high-level nonfatal error handler is
invoked by a call to XtAppWarningMsg().
The high-level functions construct a string and pass it to the
lower-level interface.A low-level interface that takes a simple string, which is printed out
as the error message.  The low-level fatal error handler is invoked by
a call to XtAppError(); the low-level
nonfatal error handler is invoked by a call to
XtAppWarning().These error-reporting interfaces are used internally by Xt, but
widget or application code can also use them.
For example, when a resource is given an illegal value in a resource
file, the widget or application can report the error or warning to
the user (which depends on whether the widget or application can
continue after the error--most widgets issue only warnings and then
fall back on their default value).
ID="IX-1013-14-8"error handlinglevelsThe low-level handlers are much easier to use, but they do not
support internationalization (alternate languages) at all since the
messages are hardcoded in the application.  The high-level handlers
can potentially support internationalization, but not as elegantly
as the normal resource database since Xt searches for the error
database file in a fixed location, not using the language string.
If you want your application or widget to run in more than one
language, you should use the high-level handlers, but only one
database for one language can be installed on a system at a time.
This is likely to be improved in later releases of Xt.To use the low-level handlers, you specify the string message as
the sole argument to XtAppError() or XtAppWarning().
ID="IX-1013-14-9"XtAppErrorID="IX-1013-14-10"XtAppWarningID="IX-1013-14-11"XtAppErrorMsgID="IX-1013-14-12"XtAppWarningMsg
Contrary to what you might expect, the high-level handlers
XtAppErrorMsg() and XtAppWarningMsg() are actually
harder to use than the low-level handlers.  You must pass six
arguments to the calls that generate the errors or warnings, and then
to take advantage of their benefits you must set up an error resource
database.  The first three arguments are the name, type, and class of
the error.  The use of these three arguments
is not yet standardized since they are not widely used.  However, in
Xt itself,
the name identifies the error message, and the type identifies the
task that
was in progress when the error occurred (or the section of code).
The class, within Xt, is always XtToolkitError.
The three remaining arguments of XtAppErrorMsg() and
XtAppWarningMsg()
are a default message, a parameter list, and the number of parameters.
The default message will be printed only if no matching message is
found in the database.  Because Xt does not define or install any
error database, it uses these default messages only, and ignores the
name, type, and class information.  (Xt uses the high-level
handlers so that an error resource file can be installed to
print all the errors in a foreign language.)
The parameter list is used together with
the message in the database.  The message may be in standard
printf format,
and the parameters are used to fill in any variable fields.LINKEND="EX-1013-14-1"Example 14-1 shows one of the rare cases where XtAppErrorMsg() is invoked in

The MIT distribution does not include an XtErrorDB database,
but you can define one.  
Since this database is made up of one file, you must append the resource
settings you need to this file rather than replacing it.
The resource name searched for in the database is the concatenation
of the name and type arguments specified in the
calls to XtAppErrorMsg() or XtAppWarningMsg().ID="IX-1013-14-14"error handlingredefining handlersYou can redefine the routine that prints the message in order to
change the fixed part of the message or to add features like logging
of errors and warnings.  Use XtAppSetErrorMsgHandler() and

handlers) or XtAppSetErrorHandler() and
ID="IX-1013-14-15"XtAppSetErrorHandlerXtAppSetWarningHandler() (if you are using the low-level

XtErrorMsgHandler(2) and XtErrorHandler(2)

a description of how to define a new error or warning handler.
The default error and warning
messages printed are:ID="SC-1013-14-1"X Toolkit Error:   message.            (for errors)
X Toolkit Warning: message.            (for warnings)Remember that Xt itself uses these messages (not just your widget

remain appropriate when called from anywhere in the Xt, widget, or
application code.  If you want the message to identify the name of
the widget set or widget, you must include this information in the

It calls XtAppWarningMsg() with the appropriate arguments
to issue a suitable warning.  Note however, that the class used
is XtToolkitError.  It may be better to
use a class that describes the widget or widget set that
defines
the converter.

of the Core widget class.  Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups, also discusses using gadgets,
which are subclasses of the RectObj widget class.  As described there,
gadgets are windowless widgets that are especially useful for menu
panes, because they cut back on the overhead that would be required to
implement the same thing using a widget for each pane.The third and final Xt class you can subclass is
the Object widget class.  Objects
are windowless widgets like gadgets, but they lack geometry resources,
sensitivity resources, and the expose method.  They provide
support for resources and callbacks, and that is all.The primary use of objects is to create replaceable subparts
of a widget.  For example, the R4 Athena Text widget uses objects to
implement its source and sink, which control the storage and
the display of the data respectively.  By replacing the source
and sink, you could develop a multi-color or multi-font editor
without having to rewrite the central widget which
implements all the editing commands.An object has the following methods:  class_initialize,
class_part
_initialize,
set_values, and get_values_hook.  All these methods
have the same purposes as in widgets.While a gadget uses part of its parent's window, an object shares its
parent's entire window,
and is not managed at all by its parent since it has no geometry.
The parent of an object is normally a widget that is a subclass of
Core but not Composite or Constraint (unlike gadget parents).But like gadgets, objects depend on cooperation by their parent,
and require a specially designed parent.  The object parent's methods
make calls to functions defined by the object child instead of doing
the work themselves.  The object child's functions can be either
semi-public functions or they can be class methods defined by the
object.  The latter is done so that subclasses of the object can
replace the functions.As an example, let's look at how the Athena Text widget handles
drawing.  The drawing is done by the TextSink object, and its
subclass AsciiSink.  Although an object has no expose
method, it provides an equivalent function that draws on the
parent.  This function is either a semi-public function (public to
its parent but not to the application writer), or it is a class method.
The Text widget uses both techniques.  TextSink provides a semi-public
function XawTextSinkDisplayText(), which is called by Text
whenever drawing is needed.XawTextSinkDisplayText() calls one of
TextSink's class methods called DisplayText.  DisplayText is a class
method so that subclasses of TextSink can replace it or inherit it.
AsciiSink does replace this method with code that draws the text in a
single constant-width font, in the foreground and background colors.
So in order to write a Text widget that draws in more than two colors,
you would just have to write an object that is a new subclass of
TextSink.When Text calls XawTextSinkDisplayText(), this function calls
one of TextSink's class methods called DisplayText.  DisplayText is a
class method so that subclasses of TextSink can replace it or inherit
it.  AsciiSink does replace this method with code that draws the text in
a single constant-width font, in the foreground and background colors.
So in order to write a Text widget that draws in more than two colors,
you would just have to write an object that is a new subclass of
TextSink.An object may assume that it should draw on its parent, but this
is not necessarily the case, since an object could have an object
as its parent. An object also has no idea of its own size, since it has
no geometry data in its instance structure, and therefore doesn't
by itself know what size window it is drawing into.
To solve both these problems, XawTextSinkDisplayText() passes
the parent's widget ID and the parent's size into the objects drawing code.ID="S1-1013-14-3"Macros For Getting InformationID="IX-1013-14-34"widgetsmacros forID="IX-1013-14-35" SPAN="START"macrosXt provides several macros and functions for getting information
about widgets.  Some of these, such as XtIsRealized() and
XtIsManaged(), you have seen before in the context of
widget methods.
ID="IX-1013-14-36"XtIsRealizedID="IX-1013-14-37"XtIsManagedSome of these are macros and some are functions,
and some are macros when used in widget code and functions when
used in application code.  This does not affect how
they can be used, so we won't bother to specify which can
be both functions and macros.  We will use the term "macro"for all of these informational routines.  In Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, they are
listed alphabetically, together with all of the Intrinsics
functions.ID="IX-1013-14-38"XtIsCompositeID="IX-1013-14-39"XtIsSubclass
Xt provides two basic macros for determining the class of a
widget:  XtIsComposite() and XtIsSubclass().  These are primarily
used internally by Xt to implement geometry management, but you
may find a use for them.  For example, you might write a composite
widget that uses XtIsComposite() to treat composite
children differently than simple children, or uses
XtIsSubclass() to treat constraint children or one of your
own classes uniquely.  There are lots of convenience functions
for XtIsSubclass() that determine if a widget is a subclass
of a particular class.  These are XtIsObject(),
XtIsRectObj(), XtIsWidget(), XtIsComposite(),
XtIsConstraint(), XtIsShell(), XtIsOverrideShell(),
XtIsWMShell(), XtIsVendorShell(),
XtIsTransientShell(), XtIsTopLevelShell(), and
XtIsApplicationShell().ID="IX-1013-14-40"XtIsManagedYou have already seen XtIsManaged() used in composite widgets.
See Chapter 12, Geometry Management.ID="IX-1013-14-41"XtIsRealizedYou have also already seen XtIsRealized() used in various
methods to make sure a widget has a window before operations are
attempted on the window.  For example, the expose method
calls XtIsRealized() before drawing into the window.ID="IX-1013-14-42"XtIsSensitiveXtIsSensitive() checks the value of the
XmNsensitive resource for a widget and its ancestors.
If any of them is False, it returns False.
Remember that sensitivity controls whether a widget responds
to user events.ID="IX-1013-14-43"XtHasCallbacksXtHasCallbacks() lets you tell whether a widget class has
a callback of a certain resource name, and whether any callback
functions
have actually been added to it.  It returns the enum
value XtCallbackNoList if there is no callback list,
XtCallbackHasNone if there is a callback list with no
functions on it,
and XtCallbackHasSome if there is a callback list
containing functions pointers.ID="IX-1013-14-44"XtNameToWidgetXtNameToWidget() searches a hierarchy for the widget ID of the
specified widget
instance name.  Its primary use from the application is to get the IDs
of the child widgets of a compound widget such as Dialog, so
that their resources can be set directly.  This is a violation of
the rules of data hiding, however, and is not recommended.  In widget
code, XtNameToWidget() is used to provide a layer of abstraction so that
widgets can be identified using string names.  For example, it is used
by the converter defined by Form that allows widget names to be
specified in resource files.
The opposite function, which returns a widget instance name given
the widget ID, is XtName() (which perhaps should have been
called "XtWidgetToName").ID="IX-1013-14-45"XtWindowToWidgetXtWindowToWidget() gives you the Widget which corresponds
to the specified X window ID.  This is used mainly by Xt, but
you may find a use for it.ID="IX-1013-14-46"XtDisplayOfObjectID="IX-1013-14-47"XtScreenOfObjectID="IX-1013-14-48"XtWindowOfObjectXtDisplayOfObject(), XtScreenOfObject(), and
XtWindowOfObject() search the parental hierarchy of an
object to discover the closest windowed ancestor and then return
a pointer to a Display structure, a pointer to a
Screen structure, or a Window ID.  These macros
are useful for making Xlib calls from within code
that implements a subclass of Object.ID="IX-1013-14-49"XtGetApplicationNameAndClassXtGetApplicationNameAndClass() returns the name and class
strings of an application.  The name is usually
argv[0] stripped of any directories, while the class is the
string passed as the second argument of XtAppInitialize().
These are the name and class used by Xt to look up resources for
the application and its widgets.  You are not likely to need this
function.
ID="IX-1013-14-50" SPAN="END"macrosID="S1-1013-14-4"The accept_focus Method and the Keyboard FocusID="IX-1013-14-51"keyboardkeyboard focus; aboutID="IX-1013-14-52"accept_focus methodID="IX-1013-14-53" SPAN="START"methodsaccept_focusThe keyboard focus is the window to which the server sends keyboard
events.
The window manager controls which top-level window gets
the keyboard focus (using either a click-to-type or pointer-following
model).  Once an application's top-level window gets
the focus, it can set the focus to one of its children;  that's
the way Motif's keyboard traversal code works.  As described
in Chapter 5, More About Motif, within a Motif application, you can have either a
click-to-type or pointer-following model, although keyboard
operation is only possible if the click-to-type model is used.The Core class part structure includes a field for the
accept_focus method.  Theoretically, this method lets a
widget set the keyboard focus to one of its children when it gets the
keyboard focus.  A typical example is an application that wants to
set the keyboard focus to the text entry child of a dialog box
whenever the
dialog box is given the keyboard focus by the window manager.
This would be done so that the user can type with the pointer
anywhere in the dialog widget instead of just with the pointer in the
text entry widget.ID="IX-1013-14-54"XSetInputFocus Xlib functionTo implement this example, the text entry child would need an
accept_focus method that would set the keyboard focus to
itself using the Xlib call XSetInputFocus().  The dialog
box would need an accept_focus method that called
ID="IX-1013-14-55"XtCallAcceptFocusID="IX-1013-14-56"eventsFocusInID="IX-1013-14-57"eventsFocusOutXtCallAcceptFocus() on the text entry widget child.
The application can call XtCallAcceptFocus() on
the dialog widget in response to FocusIn events to start this
process, and set the focus back to PointerRoot on
FocusOut events.
For details on these events, see Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.
This procedure for giving the child of a dialog the keyboard focus
is necessary because the application can't find out the name of
the child that should have the focus without breaking
widget encapsulation rules.In reality, none of the Motif widgets (and none of the Athena widgets,
for that matter) use the accept_focus method.  The
keyboard traversal code is implemented separately.An accept_focus method should return a Boolean value
to report whether it succeeded in setting the
keyboard focus, and XtCallAcceptFocus() returns
this same value.
ID="IX-1013-14-58" SPAN="END"methodsaccept_focusID="IX-1013-14-59"XtSetKeyboardFocusID="IX-1013-14-60"keyboardkeyboard focus; about
The XtSetKeyboardFocus() function redirects
keyboard events that occur within an application to any widget
within that application.  This is different from
XSetInputFocus() in that no request to the server is made,
and the redirection of keyboard events is handled entirely by
Xt's event dispatching mechanism.  However, XtSetKeyboardFocus()
should not be used in Motif applications, since it interferes
with the keyboard traversal code.ID="S1-1013-14-5"Keyboard InterpretationKeyboard handling in X is designed so that you can write a program that
will operate on systems with widely different
physical keyboards.  To accomplish this, there are several layers
of mappings:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-14-61"eventsKeyPressID="IX-1013-14-62"keycodesaboutID="IX-1013-14-63"keysymsabout
The first mapping is between physical keys and keycodes
(a number for each key), and varies between servers.  A
KeyPress event includes only the keycode and information about
what other keys and buttons were being held at the time of the
keypress.  Programs that interpret keycodes directly will operate on
only one type of system.The next
mapping is between keycodes and keysyms, which are symbolic constants
beginning with XK_
that represent the meaning of a key press.  This mapping takes into
account whether
Shift or other modifier keys were being held during the press.
ID="IX-1013-14-64"XLookupString Xlib function
Xlib provides the routine XLookupString() that converts the
keycode in a key event to
the appropriate keysym.  Internationalized programs use the
XmbLookupString or XwcLookupString versions which
can figure out the keysym resulting from key sequences entered into
an input method.  Portable programs use keysyms to interpret
key events.  The keycode to keysym mapping is server-wide.  It can
be changed, but this is normally done only to accomplish radical
changes in the placement of keys such as changing a QWERTY style
keyboard to DVORAK.
ID="IX-1013-14-65"portabilityThe final mapping is between keysyms and strings.  For printing
characters, XLookupString() also returns a string
representation of the interpretation of the key pressed.
For example, if the key marked A was pressed with no other keys
held down, the string returned would be a.  A text entry widget,
for example, would append this string to the string being
displayed, but modify the string in other ways to handle keysyms that
do not have a string representation such as XK_Backspace.
The values of keysyms are arranged logically so that all printing
characters have a particular range.Motif adds virtual key bindings to this model, as described in
LINKEND="S1-1013-5-9"Section 5.9, "Drag and Drop."When you write an action that accepts key events, you will usually
need to interpret the meaning of the key pressed.  Xt provides
its own interface to XLookupString():
XtTranslateKeycode().  You pass several fields of the
key event to XtTranslateKeycode(), and it returns the keysym.
However, XtTranslateKeycode() does not return the string
interpretation of the key event that would be returned by
XLookupString().  If you need that string, you will have to
call XLookupString().ID="IX-1013-14-66"XtTranslateKeycodeID="IX-1013-14-67"XtTranslateKey
Xt provides XtTranslateKeycode() because Xt also provides
routines for changing the way the translation returned by
XtTranslateKeycode() is done.  XtSetKeyTranslator()
allows you to specify your own procedure to convert from the key
event information to a keysym.  The default key event translation
procedure is XtTranslateKey(), and so you can restore the default
translator if necessary, and so that you can call it from your
own translator to get default translations (you need to add only the
code that makes the translations not done by the default translator).
See XtKeyProc in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, for details on providing a key event translation procedure.
ID="IX-1013-14-68"XtKeyProcfunction prototypeAmong these routines for modifying the interpretation of key events
is a facility for changing the handling of capitalization.
For example, most keyboards have the question mark (?) symbol over
the slash (/) symbol on one key.  The standard case converter
converts a press of this key with the Shift key held down to the
XK_question keysym.  In rare cases a keyboard may have a
different symbol over / and put ? somewhere else.  Also, some
keyboards have two or more symbols on a single key, some of which
are not represented at all by standard keysyms.
The case converter handles these situations.
The case converter is usually called from the key translator described
above.  To call the case converter, use
XtConvertCase(), and to change the case converter, call
XtRegisterCaseConverter().
See XtCaseProc in Volume Five, X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual, for details on writing a case converter procedure.
ID="IX-1013-14-69"XtConvertCaseID="IX-1013-14-70"XtRegisterCaseConverterID="IX-1013-14-71"XtCaseProcfunction prototypeNote that the translation manager uses these same key translation and
case converter routines to interpret translation tables.  Therefore,
make sure that you add features only to them, keeping existing features.Xt also provides two routines that may help in interpreting key events:
XtGetKeysymTable() and XtKeysymToKeycodeList().
ID="IX-1013-14-72"XtGetKeysymTableID="IX-1013-14-73"XtKeysymToKeycodeList
The former returns the entire mapping of keycodes to keysyms for
the server, while the latter tells you what keycodes are listed
for the specified keysym.  Neither function is necessary for
routine keyboard handling.From within an action routine, you can call XtGetActionKeysym()
to get the keysym that resulted in the action being called.
ID="IX-1013-14-74"XtGetActionKeysym
This can be very useful, since the event passed to the action contains
only the keycode of the key that was pressed.  However, there
is another way to achieve a similar result.  You can
use string parameters of actions to pass in the keysym that
you specified in the translation table.  For example, if you
provide the translation :<Key>q : Quit(q), the Quit action
will be passed the string "q" in its params argument.
However, XtGetActionKeysym() is very useful if you translate
a wide range of key events to one action, and then want to
distinguish between them in the action.ID="S1-1013-14-6"Memory AllocationID="IX-1013-14-75"memory allocationID="IX-1013-14-76"XtMallocID="IX-1013-14-77"XtCallocID="IX-1013-14-78"XtReallocID="IX-1013-14-79"XtFreeXt provides routines for performing routine memory allocation and
deallocation.  The routines XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(),
XtRealloc(), and XtFree() are equivalents of the standard
C routines malloc, calloc, realloc, and
free but they add error checking and reporting.  The
allocation routines make sure the allocation succeeded, and if it
did not, they print a (fatal) error message.  XtFree() makes
sure the passed pointer is not NULL before calling free.ID="IX-1013-14-80"XtNewXtNew() is a macro which allocates storage for one instance of
the passed type and returns a pointer.  For example,
XtNew(XtCallbackList) allocates storage for one callback list
structure.
ID="IX-1013-14-81"XtNewStringXtNewString() is a macro that allocates storage for a string,
copies the string into the new storage, and returns the pointer.
For example, a string can be copied into new storage using the
following:ID="SC-1013-14-2"    static String buf[] = "How do you do?";
    String p;
    p = XtNewString(buf);After this sequence, p points to a separate string that
contains "How do you do?"  Then buf can be changed without
affecting p.ID="S1-1013-14-7"Action Hooks and Calling Actions DirectlyID="IX-1013-14-82"action hooksID="IX-1013-14-83"hooksXt allows you to register any number of functions to be
called whenever any action in an application context
ID="IX-1013-14-84"XtAppAddActionHook
is invoked.  This is done with XtAppAddActionHook().
Note that there is just one "action hook" in the application context,
so that all the action hook functions registered for that application
context are called whenever any of the actions in that
application context are invoked.  The registration does not specify any particular action or any particular widget.The main reason for registering an action hook is to record all the
ID="IX-1013-14-85"XtCallActionProc
actions that were invoked in an application, so that they can be
played back later using XtCallActionProc().
An action hook function is called with all the same arguments that are
passed to an action, plus the string name of the
action.  The action hook function would store this information as a
unit each time it was called.
When it comes time to play back the recorded actions, it would
pass all the information in each unit to XtCallActionProc().ID="IX-1013-14-86"XtRemoveActionHookAn action hook can be removed with XtRemoveActionHook().ID="S1-1013-14-8"Xt Grabbing FunctionsGrabs are used mostly for popup menus and dialog boxes.
As described in Chapter 13, Menus, Gadgets, and Cascaded Popups,
Xt has its own grab mode that controls the distribution
of events within one application, which can be used to restrict
events to one popup in a cascade or allow events to go to any
popup in a cascade.  As also described there, popup menus in
particular need a passive global grab of the pointer in order to
detect button releases that occur completely outside the application
so that menus can be popped down properly.  A passive global grab
actually instructs the server to redirect events to a certain window.
All the grabbing needs of popups are
satisfied by the built-in action XtMenuPopup(), or by the
function XtPopupSpringLoaded(), which can be used in
a callback function.
If necessary, you can write your own version of XtMenuPopup()
and register it with XtRegisterGrabAction() so that the
appropriate passive global grab is in effect.The above facilities should be quite sufficient for your needs
in the area of popups.  However, it is possible that you may need
an global grab for some other purpose.  Perhaps you need all
keyboard events in one window for a short time and don't want
to change existing translations or accelerators for keyboard events
in other widgets.  This is only one plausible scenario.The Xlib functions for grabbing are XGrabKey(),
XGrabButton(), XGrabKeyboard(), and XGrabPointer().
Each of these functions has an analogue for ungrabbing.
But Xt provides its own version of all eight of these functions.
You should use the Xt versions because they are integrated into
Xt and take care of things like making sure the widget that
is to get the grab has been realized.
In other words, if you do need the server to redirect events for
you using a grab, use the following functions:
XtGrabKey(), XtGrabButton(), XtGrabKeyboard(),
XtUngrabKeyboard(), and XtUngrabPointer().
ID="IX-1013-14-87"XtGrabKeyID="IX-1013-14-88"XtGrabButtonID="IX-1013-14-89"XtGrabKeyboardID="IX-1013-14-90"XtGrabPointerID="IX-1013-14-91"XtUngrabKeyID="IX-1013-14-92"XtUngrabButtonID="IX-1013-14-93"XtUngrabKeyboardID="IX-1013-14-94"XtUngrabPointer
For more on global grabs, see Chapter 8 in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.ID="S1-1013-14-9"File Finding and InternationalizationXt's facilities for allowing an application to run in different
languages are mostly built into the resource database mechanism.
Where Xt searches for resource files depends on a language
string, which can be set within resources at run time or with an
environment variable to affect one
user's environment.  This is described in Chapter 10, Resource Management and Type Conversion.
In R5 and later, Xt also uses the value of the XtNcustomization
resource to set the path it uses when looking for application defaults
ID="IX-1013-14-95"XtNcustomizationID="IX-1013-14-96"customizationID="IX-1013-14-97"resource filescolor vs. monoID="IX-1013-14-98"color vs. monoID="IX-1013-14-99"mono vs. colorID="IX-1013-14-100"filesresource
and other files.  XtNcustomization is normally used to
supply separate sets of resources for color and monochrome screens.The functions that Xt uses to implement its search for resource
files are also available to you for searching for application
files.  This allows you to provide separate data files for each
language for a help system, for example.  The primary function
ID="IX-1013-14-101"XtResolvePathname
you would use to do this is XtResolvePathname(), since
it searches directories in a standard order based on X/Open
Portability Guide conventions.If you want to find a file but are not interested in
ID="IX-1013-14-102"XtFindFile
internationalization, you can use XtFindFile().
This function can simplify code that reads files, since it helps
handle differences in file systems.ID="S1-1013-14-10"Application ContextsID="IX-1013-14-103" SPAN="START"application contextsaboutID="IX-1013-14-104" SPAN="START"portabilityThe introduction to application contexts in LINKEND="S1-1013-3-9"Section 3.9, "More About Application Contexts" described their use in
99 percent of applications.  As you may recall, their purpose
is chiefly to attain portability to certain systems that do not
provide a separate address space for each process.Xt provides parallel versions of many routines--one set that uses
the default application context, and one set that has an explicit
application context argument.  The routines that use the
default application context are remnants of an earlier release when
application contexts did not work properly.
To achieve the desired portability, you must now use the
versions with the explicit argument.  We have done this throughout

presents possibilities that you might wish to explore.
Having more than one application context in the same program allows
you to have one program that when run looks like two or more
independent programs.  This approach saves
disk space and memory on systems that don't provide shared libraries,
since the grouped programs can share a single copy of the libraries.LINKEND="FN-1013-14-1"ID="FN-1013-14-1"In SunView, many of the basic applications were grouped in a single
binary probably for this reason.
The Xlib and Xt libraries are quite large.  For example, on a
Sony NWS-841 workstation, the executable image of a "hello, world"application written with Xt and the Athena widget set uses 450K of
disk space.  One of the
most complicated existing X applications, xterm, uses 600K
of disk space on this system.  Therefore, the various libraries
account for about three-quarters of the disk space used, even for a
fairly large program.ID="IX-1013-14-159"optimizationHaving two application contexts makes each sub-application more
separate than if they were just under different top-level Shell
widgets.  Each widget class has an action list, and
each application context has a separate context-wide action list.
When the translation manager looks for an action, it looks in the
widget class action list first, and then the application context
action list.
Therefore, each sub-application could add an action
to its application context without conflict with another
sub-application adding a different action of the same name.On parallel processing machines, each separate application context
could run in parallel.  However, it is difficult to write portable
code to take advantage of this, since each architecture has different
conventions for indicating parallelisms in C code.ID="S2-1013-14-2"Rewriting XtAppMainLoop for Multiple Application ContextsID="IX-1013-14-160"XtAppMainLoopand multiple application contextsID="IX-1013-14-161"application contextsmultipleTo use multiple application contexts, you need to write your
own equivalent of XtAppMainLoop() to dispatch events to your
multiple application contexts.  This is necessary because
XtAppMainLoop() dispatches events only from one application
context, and it never returns so you can't call it again for the other.
ID="IX-1013-14-162"XtAppNextEventID="IX-1013-14-163"XtAppPeekEventID="IX-1013-14-164"XtAppPendingID="IX-1013-14-165"XtAppProcessEventID="IX-1013-14-166"XFlush Xlib functionID="IX-1013-14-167"XSync Xlib functionThe available tools are XtAppNextEvent(),
XtAppPeekEvent(), XtAppPending(),
XtAppProcessEvent(), and the Xlib functions XFlush() and
XSync().  Rewriting XtAppMainLoop() for two or more
application contexts is tricky, because you don't want to let the
dispatching of any one application context get behind.  It is not as
simple as dispatching events from each application context alternately,
since the events might not occur alternately.  It is easy to get stuck
waiting for events in one application context while events queue up
at the other.
There is little experience in how this should be done properly, and
no examples in the distribution from MIT.
However, hypothetically, the following describes how it could work.To do this properly, you have to understand how
Xlib's network optimization works.  Xlib buffers up many types of
requests and sends (flushes) them to the server as a group.LINKEND="FN-1013-14-2"ID="FN-1013-14-2"For a detailed discussion of Xlib's network optimization and its
effects, see the introduction to Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.
A flush is most commonly caused by a routine such as
XtAppNextEvent()
that waits for an event if none are available.  It is because
XtAppNextEvent() waits forever for an event that the
routine could get locked waiting for events in one application context
while the user types frantically in the other.The answer is to use XtAppPending() to determine whether
an event is available on a particular application context, and
then call XtAppProcessEvent() if there is an event to process.
Then continue to do the same on each other application context.
However, this alone is not enough.  Neither XtAppPending()
nor XtAppProcessEvent() called in this manner cause Xlib's
buffer of requests to be sent to the server.  Therefore, periodic
calls to XSync() or XFlush() are necessary to
flush the output buffer.  The difficult part is to call these
enough to flush the buffer when necessary, but not so much as to
eliminate the advantages of the buffering.  There is no ideal
solution to this problem.On multi-tasking systems it is perhaps possible to fork
so that each application context runs in a separate process.ID="S2-1013-14-3"Functions Used with Multiple Application ContextsXtWidgetToApplicationContext() and
ID="IX-1013-14-168"XtDisplayToApplicationContextXtDisplayToApplicationContext() could be useful if you
use more than one application context in an application.
XtWidgetToApplicationContext() is also useful in widget code,
to call error-issuing routines that require an application context
argument, such as XtAppWarning() and XtAppWarningMsg().ID="S1-1013-14-11"Multiple Top-level ShellsA single application can have more than one top-level window.
In other words, you are not restricted to containing your application's
entire user interface in a single rectangle.  If you have one section
of the application that is most appropriate as a long, thin vertical
window that looks like a long, permanent menu, and another section that
is a long, horizontal bar such as a ruler, each of these could be
a separate top-level window.  That way, not only is
less screen space wasted than if these two windows were placed within
a single rectangle, but the user can move the two windows around
separately using the window manager.  The user can also iconify them
separately when not needed.ID="IX-1013-14-169"XtCreateApplicationShellID="IX-1013-14-170"XtAppCreateShellID="IX-1013-14-171"XtVaAppCreateShellID="IX-1013-14-172"multipletoplevel shells
To create additional top-level application shell widgets, you call
XtAppCreateShell() or XtVaAppCreateShell().
(XtCreateApplicationShell() is now superceded.)
The class specified in the call should be
topLevelShellWidgetClass.As you may know, a single server may have several screens attached.
At present, all shells created will appear on the default screen.
ID="IX-1013-14-173"screenspecifying default
There is no way for the application to specify that a shell be created
on a particular screen, but then again, doing this is usually unwise
anyway because not many users actually have more than one screen.
The user can specify which screen is considered the default screen using
the -display command-line option.ID="S1-1013-14-12"Connecting to Multiple ServersOne of the great features of the server-client model is
that a single program can connect to several servers to
display on the screens of several users.  For example, this would allow
you to create an X-based version of the UNIX utility wall
in which one user can make a message appear on all user's screens
throughout a network.
You could also create a conferencing program in which each user has a
window on their screen in which they can type and view typing by
others in real time, and their typing will appear on all the other
user's screens.ID="IX-1013-14-174"displayconnecting to multiple displaysID="IX-1013-14-175"XtOpenDisplayID="IX-1013-14-176"application contextsXtOpenDisplay
The Xt application opens a connection
with a server using XtOpenDisplay() (this routine requires
an explicit application context argument).  Once you have opened
the connection, you will want to create a shell widget on the
server's default screen using XtCreateApplicationShell() or
XtAppCreateShell().  Then, you create widgets for each
server simply by using the appropriate Shell widget as parent.
Thereafter, XtAppMainLoop() dispatches events from all the
connections to the appropriate widget.
ID="IX-1013-14-177" SPAN="END"application contextsaboutID="S1-1013-14-13"Class Extension StructuresX Consortium standards, once adopted, can only be changed in
ways that are binary and source compatible with the original
standard specification.  Xt became an X consortium standard
in Release 3.  Therefore, Release 4 and later releases are
ID="IX-1013-14-178"Release 4 (R4)
required to be source and binary compatible with Release 3.
Source compatibility means that properly coded applications
ID="IX-1013-14-179"sourcecompatibility
and widgets written to the R3 specification should compile and
work under R4 and later releases.  Source compatibility is maintained
by keeping all programming interfaces intact while adding features
with new interfaces.  Binary compatibility means that
widgets written and compiled with R3 must be able to be linked
with R4 or R5 Xt and Xlib libraries and still run.  Source compatibility
is necessary but not sufficient for binary compatibility.  The
major addition requirement of binary compatibility is that
fields added to structures must be added to the end of the structure.In Chapter 6, Inside a Widget, you saw how a class structure for a widget class is
built by nesting the class part structures of all its
superclasses into one big structure, the class record.
The X consortium could not simply add fields to the class part
structures of the basic Xt classes
without breaking binary compatibility with existing subclasses
because the class parts of basic Xt classes appear in the middle of
the class record of subclasses.  Therefore, they used extension
structures to add these fields.Class extension structures allowed the X consortium to
ID="IX-1013-14-180"classextension structureID="IX-1013-14-181"extensionsstructures
add to the class structures of basic Xt classes.  The last field
of each basic Xt class is called extension.  This field
can be set to a pointer to the class's extension structure, which
contains its added fields.  New features that
required additional class structure fields were added to the
Composite and Constraint classes in R4.  Therefore, these two
classes now have extension structures.Some classes, such as Core, do not have an extension structure
because no additional class fields have yet been necessary.
They still have the extension field, but it is not used.A class extension structure is defined in the private header file
of a widget class.  The extension structure for Composite is
called CompositeClassExtensionRec
as shown in
LINKEND="EX-1013-14-2"Example 14-2.ID="EX-1013-14-2"Common fields in a class extension recordtypedef struct {
    XtPointer next_extension;/* 1st 4 mandated for all ext rec */
    XrmQuark record_type;    /* NULLQUARK; on CompositeClassPart */
    long version;            /* must be XtCompositeExtensionVersion */
    Cardinal record_size;    /* sizeof(CompositeClassExtensionRec) */
    Boolean accepts_objects;
} CompositeClassExtensionRec, *CompositeClassExtension;All extension structures start with the same four fields.
The only field in this structure actually used by Composite
is accepts_objects, the use of which is described
in LINKEND="S2-1013-12-17"Section 12.4.5, "The class_part_init Method."  The accepts_objects field is only
used by Composite widgets that have the code necessary to accept
gadget children.  When a widget class needs an extension feature, the
widget class initializes the extension structure in its .c
file, and then in the class_ initialize method sets the
extension field to point to the extension structure.When a widget class does not need an extension feature--for
example, a Composite widget that does not accept gadget
children--the widget class does not provide code in the
class_initialize method to set the extension field.The .c file of all widget classes should initially set all
extension fields to NULL.  The difference between
classes that use extension features and those that don't is only the
presence or absence of code in class_initialize to set the
ID="IX-1013-14-182"classclass_initialize methodextension fields.The four required fields in an extension structure are:next_extensionSpecifies the next record in the list, or NULL.record_typeSpecifies the particular structure declaration to which
each extension record instance conforms.versionSpecifies a symbolic constant supplied by
the definer of the structure.record_sizeSpecifies the total number of bytes allocated for the
extension record.When you initialize an extension structure of a given class in the .c
file, you always set these four fields to the same values.
LINKEND="EX-1013-14-3"Example 14-3 shows how to initialize the Composite extension structure.
The first two fields are usually NULL and NULLQUARK.
The reference page for each class that has an extension structure
will document how to initialize the third and fourth fields.ID="SC-1013-14-3"CompositeClassExtensionRec extension_rec = {
    /* next_extension */  NULL,
    /* record_type */     NULLQUARK,
    /* version */         XtCompositeExtensionVersion,
    /* record_size */     sizeof(CompositeClassExtensionRec),
    /* accepts_objects */ True,  /* only new field */
};The next_extension field implies correctly that you can nest
extension structures.  Perhaps a later release of Xt will require
the addition of more Composite class fields.  These could
be added to the end of the existing extension structure, or a
new extension structure could be defined and a pointer to it placed
in next_extension.  This allows additions to be made to
a class structure without breaking binary compatibility.You may be wondering whether you should use extension structures
when extending your own widgets.  Probably not.  Because you
are likely to release your set of widgets as a package, you have
no need for binary compatibility with previous releases (of your
own).  Binary compatibility would only be an advantage if you wanted
to replace a few widgets from a former release and save users who
may have subclassed the widgets you have replaced from
recompiling their widgets.
For the trouble involved, the benefit is very small.ID="S1-1013-14-14"Using Editres in Xt

editres can help programmers
create an app-default file and fallback resources and
test custom Xt widgets.  This section describes how to add support to
Motif applications, and how to use editres as an aid in
debugging widgets and applications.ID="S2-1013-14-4"A Tour of editresThe editres application is part of the core distribution in
Release 5.  This section is a brief tour of the editres resource
editor.  It will illustrate how to use editres to
customize an X Toolkit application.  When the
user starts editres it looks like 
LINKEND="FG-1013-14-1"Figure 14-1.ID="FG-1013-14-1"editres immediately after startupFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="14.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-14-3"The editres application contains four areas;
The Menu Bar, the Panner, the Message Area, and the Tree Display
(which is initially empty).  You begin by choosing Get
Widget Tree from the Command menu and, following the instructions in
the Message Area, select an X Toolkit application by clicking a
pointer button.  
LINKEND="FG-1013-14-2"Figure 14-2 shows the result of selecting the xman
application.  (Note that the application must have
support for editres.  All applications written using the
Athena widget set have that support built in as of R5.  Applications
written using Motif need to have support added, as shown later.ID="FG-1013-14-2"editres with widget tree displayedFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="14.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-14-4"The Tree Display now contains the widget hierarchy of xman, displayed
graphically.  You can now see the name of each widget in the
application, and the parent-child relationship of each of these
widgets.  By using the Tree menu or a keyboard accelerator the user
can also see the Class names, Widget ID's, or Window ID's.  
LINKEND="FG-1013-14-3"Figure 14-3 shows the same xman application, but with the Window ID's
displayed instead of the widget names.ID="FG-1013-14-3"editres display window IDs of widget treeFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="14.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-14-5"By selecting "Select Widget in Client" from the Tree
menu you can click a pointer button anywhere in the application,
and editres will highlight the corresponding widget in the
Tree Display.  
LINKEND="FG-1013-14-4"Figure 14-4 shows the
result of clicking in the topLabel widget of the xman
application.  Editres can also do the inverse of this;
selecting the "Flash Active Widgets" command from the Tree menu
will show you (by flashing widgets in the application)
which widgets are currently selected in the Tree Display.ID="FG-1013-14-4"Flashing widget in application by selecting it in editresFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="14.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-14-6"With these two commands you can easily determine
the correspondence between the application itself and the Tree
Display representation of it.
Because a resource specification is simply a description of the
widget's locations in the Tree Display and can be constructed by
concatenating the names of the widget and it ancestors, editres
can easily construct valid resource specifications that apply to
the widgets selected.  For example, the
fully specified resource name of the topLevel widget is 
xman.topBox.form.topLabel.Once you find the widget you want to modify you can
select the Show Resource Box command to bring up a dialog box that
will allow you to set the resource of that widget.  A Resource Box is
shown in 
LINKEND="FG-1013-14-5"Figure 14-5, as it would look after
changing the topLabel widget's resource to "Testing, Testing."ID="FG-1013-14-5"Resource box for the selected Label widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="14.05.gif" ID="GC-1013-14-7"At the top of the Resource Box is the resource line currently being
edited.  This is the actual string that will be inserted into the
resource file if you decide to save a change.  Below this
is an area that allows you to modify the widgets to be
affected by this change.  This area allows you to substitute
class names for instance names, and asterisks for periods in the left
hand side of the resource specification.  These changes will loosen the
binding of the resource specification allowing this one resource line
to apply to more and more widgets (see 
LINKEND="FG-1013-14-6"Figure 14-6).
Note that no matter how the bindings are modified (by changing
periods to asterisks) the original widget will always
match the specification.ID="FG-1013-14-6"Generalizing the widgets affected by the resource specificationFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="14.06.gif" ID="GC-1013-14-8"When taken to the extreme, the resource specification can apply to
every widget in the application.  As you change the bindings of
the resource specification, the Tree Display is updated to highlight
all the widgets that will be affected by the resource line displayed.
When this is combined with the Show Highlighted Widgets command, 
which flashes the widgets in the application that correspond to
those highlighted in the Tree Display, you can quickly
determine which widgets will match a given resource specification.The next area contains a complete list of normal and constraint
resources that are available for the originally selected widget.
This area is used to select the name of the resource that the user
wishes to modify.  Foreground, for example, will set the foreground
color.  Below this area is simply a text field to allow the user to
enter the
string that will represent the resource value.  The resource value
that is entered here should be exactly what would be entered into a
resource file, thus all new lines should be escaped by a backslash
(\) and backslash-n (\n) should be used to add a new line to the
resource value.Since editres specifies all
resources as strings, it can only set those resources that can be set
from resource files.  Motif 1.1 and 1.2 do not
provide support for certain resources to be set in resource files.
One example is the XmNleftWidget resource of the Form widget.)The commands at the bottom of the Resource Box allows the user to
select the file the resources
will be written into, write the resources to the file, apply the
resource immediately to the application, or just popdown the resource
box.Note that applying the resource to the
application will not always have the same effect as restarting the
application with the resource added to the user's customization file.
This is a design constraint of the X Toolkit.  Some resources are
designed to be read once at startup, and trying to coerce them into a
dynamic resource editor is problematic.
The basic problem is that the editres support in the
application uses XtSetValues() to change the resource of the
selected widgets.  An XtSetValues() call after startup will
override any hard-coded application defaults (but not
application defaults specified in files or as fallback resources),
whereas the same resource
specification in a resource file will not.  Therefore, the results of
applying a resource setting using editres are only a guide.Those are the basic features of editres.  You can see there is
much work to be done, but the basic task of finding and setting
resource values is much simpler with this tool.  This brief
tour should give you an idea of the capabilities of the resource
editor, and hopefully stir your imagination a bit.  I will next
describe the method editres uses to communicate
with the applications.ID="S2-1013-14-5"editres as a Programmer's ToolThe programmer can use editres
to help understand the structure
of the application or develop resource settings to be used as
the app-defaults file or fallback resources.The editres tool can also be useful for testing newly written or
modified widgets.  The test program can
be written generically and then editres lets you
see the results of various resource settings.
The tests allow the widget's geometry_manager and
set_values methods to be debugged more quickly and with
much less effort than is possible without editres.Before you can do debugging or testing with editres,
you need to find out if the application you will be using
has editres support, and if not, add it.ID="S2-1013-14-6"Adding editres Support to an Xt Applicationeditres support is native to the R5 Athena
widget set, but is not native in Motif 1.1 or 1.2.
When the support is not available, only a few lines of code need
to be added to an Xt application to link in the editres
communication routines.  Also note that if you use custom widgets
with a widget set that supports editres, the custom widgets are
automatically included and no code needs to be added.
If you know the widget set you use
already supports editres, you can skip to the next section.First check that editres is not supported by the widget set
you are using, by invoking the "Get Widget Tree"command from the editres command menu, and then clicking on
your application.  If editres is not supported, the command will fail
resulting in no tree display and the
message "It appears that this client does not understand the
Editres Protocol."  This message will be displayed only after the
editres command has timed out, a process that may take up to
sixty seconds.The R5 Xmu library provides an event handler that can send and receive
the editres protocol.  To add editres support to an Xt based
application, you need only to register this event handler on at least
one shell widget in the application.  But to allow the user to select
any window in the application and activate editres, you must add it to
every shell widget in the application.  Here is the code needed to add
the event handler to one shell widget:ID="EX-1013-14-3"Adding editres support in an application   #include <X11/Xmu/Editres.h>
   XtAddEventHandler(shell, (EventMask) 0, True, _XEditResCheckMessages, NULL);This code can be added anywhere after the shell widget has been
created.  The X11R5 Xmu library must be linked into the application to
provide the routines that actually decode the protocol and process the
editres events.  Because Xmu depends upon Xt and X11, the order of
linking is important.  The link command for the application should be:ID="SC-1013-14-4" % cc <objects> -lwidget set library -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lXextOnce the application has been recompiled and relinked editres support
should be available.  If the _XEditResCheckMessages() handler was
added to only one shell in the application, be sure to select that
shell or one of its normal (non-popup) children when editres
prompts you to "Click the mouse pointer on any Xaw client."ID="S2-1013-14-7"Using editres to Understand the Structure of an ApplicationPicking up maintenance of an X application that was written by someone
else can be an exercise in patience.  Because of the event driven
nature of X applications there is no single flow of control.  In order
to find out what is happening it is often necessary to locate the
place where a widget on the screen is created in the code and then
use this information to find its widget ID and display the data
contained in that widget.  editres can make this task much
simpler.To find the place where a widget is created, use the "Select widget in
client" command, and click the pointer on the widget
of interest within the target application.  This will highlight that
widget in editres's tree display.  The tree display will show the
name of the widget, which makes finding where it was created easier,
usually a simple matter of using grep(1).  You can also view the
widget's class name, widget ID and window ID by selecting various
commands from the Tree menu, or using the keyboard accelerators
described below.COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="63"AcceleratorLEFT="70" WIDTH="356"DescriptionLEFT="0" WIDTH="63"NLEFT="70" WIDTH="356"Show widget nameLEFT="0" WIDTH="63"CLEFT="70" WIDTH="356"Show widget classLEFT="0" WIDTH="63"ILEFT="70" WIDTH="356"Show widget ID (in hex)LEFT="0" WIDTH="63"WLEFT="70" WIDTH="356"Show widget's windowLBL="14-3"Table 14-3   editres acceleratorsIf the pointer is over a widget when the accelerator is used
then only that one widget is affected.
If the pointer is over the tree background then all widgets in
the application are affected.When viewing the widget windows, the programmer is also informed if
the widget is unrealized or if the widget in question is a
non-windowed object, such as an Object or a Motif Gadget.  This
information is often useful when attempting to decipher an X protocol
error, since it contains the XID of the offending widget.  The class
names can be useful to help understand the behavior, and geometry
constraints of the current application's window layout.  Widget ID's
are mainly useful when used in concert with a symbolic debugger such
as dbx or CodeCenter (formerly Saber-C), since the values in
the widget structure can be
viewed in the debugger by de-referencing this widget pointer.To provide a permanent hard copy of the widget hierarchy of an
application, either for future reference, or for inclusion in the
application's documentation, editres provides a command called
"Dump Widget Tree to a File."  The output is dumped in an outline
format and includes both the name and class of each widget currently
in the application.  Note that this command will only show those
widgets that had been created the last time a "Get Widget Tree", or
"Refresh Current Widget Tree" command was executed.In addition to allowing the programmer to understand the structure of
an application, editres can be used to add entries to an
application defaults resource file.  To use editres as an aid
simply use the "Set
Save File" button at the bottom of the Resource Box, and then use the
"Save and Apply" button to add entries to the application defaults
file.  editres immediately applies the resource change to the
application.ID="S2-1013-14-8"Using editres to Test or Debug a WidgetThe programmer can also use editres to test some of the
dynamic characteristics of a widget.  Since a widget's most
common interface to the outside world is through the setting of
resources, the "Apply" action in editres's resource box window provides
a very convenient mechanism for testing and debugging widget
resources.  This mechanism can be used to test the widget's
set_values and Constraint set_values procedures, as well as the
widget's geometry_manager.editres gets its list of resources for a widget by sending a message to
the application.  The editres support code in the application that
receives the message then calls the Xt functions XtGetResourceList() and
XtGetConstraintResourceList() to get the list of resources supported.
Xt does not provide
functions for getting the list of resources for application resources,
objects that are not Xt children or Xt popup children, and
subresources, so they are not visible to editres.
This limitation appears in most Text widgets, because they use either
objects or subparts that have subresources, and editres cannot
find these resources.Editres passes only string values across to the application to set
resources.  Therefore, the editres support code in the application
uses a StringTo<something> converter to actually set the widget resource.
If no such converter is available, editres will not be able to
set the resource.  Since these converters are required to allow the
resource to be set in the app-defaults file or user resource file,
your widget should have them anyway, so you should not need to add
any special code to your widget in order to debug it using
editres.ID="S3-1013-14-1"Testing a Widget's set_values ProceduresTo test a widget's set_values procedure you must first pop up the
resource box associated with that widget.  The resource box is popped
up by selecting the widget in question and selecting the "Show
Resource Box" command.  This will pop up a window that shows all the
resources available to this widget.  Selecting a
resource, entering a value, and hitting the Apply button at the bottom
of the Resource Box window allows the programmer to test each resource
of this widget to verify that it is responding to them correctly.Note that each widget must register a type converter from String to
each new type of resource it created, since editres sends all values
as strings.  Writing and registering these converters is a good idea
in any case, since it allows each widget resource to be specified in
the app-defaults file or another resource file as well as through the
set_values mechanism.It is important to note that changes to a resource defined by the
superclass may often require support from the subclass.  If your new
widget, which is a subclass of an existing widget, has added some
additional functionality to a resource that is not new to this widget,
but was defined by its superclass, you must test this resources as well
(e.g., a Label widget will need to test the sensitivity resource, since
it added support for stippling the text when it becomes insensitive).
Programmers should be sure to modify the value of each resource, not
just those new resources added to this widget,To test the Constraint set_values procedure of a widget the Resource
Box of a child of this widget must be popped up.  This Resource Box
window will list the constraint resources separately from the normal
resources.  These resources can be tested with the apply button in the
same fashion as normal resources.ID="S3-1013-14-2"Testing a Widget's geometry_managerAlthough it is not obvious at first, editres can be used to test a
widget's geometry manager.  Since the size and location of every
widget are stored in resources they can be modified on-the-fly with
editres.First identify the widget whose geometry manager is to be tested.  I
will call this widget the "parent."  To test its geometry manager we
must make a request to change the geometry of one of its children.
Therefore, use editres to select one of the children of the "parent"widget and pop up its Resource Box.  This will allow the child's size
and location to be changed by modifying the x, y, width and height
resources.  Changing these attributes will in turn call upon the
geometry manager of the parent widget, allowing the programmer to see
if the proper behavior is occurring.  By placing several different
kinds of children in the parent and seeing how changes to the geometry
of each child affects the others, extensive testing can be performed
in a short period of time.Since two resources cannot be modified in a single editres command
there is no direct way to make a simultaneous width and height change
to a widget.  But if a Xaw Label or XmLabel widget is used as a child
then a change to the font will often cause a change to both the width
and height of the widget.  The effects of such a change can then be
tested in the parent's geometry manager.Editres may be expanded to include additional features.

An internationalized application reads the user's language (called
a locale) from the environment or a resource file and operates in
that language without changes to its binary.  X internationalization
is based on the ANSI-C internationalization model.
The concepts and implementation of X internationalization are described
in the Third Edition of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.
Xt support of internationalization is trivial
in most applications: the only code needed is a call to
XtSetLanguageProc() just before the call to
XtAppInitialize().  However,
if your program directly manipulates text from widgets, or
you need to write widgets that accept text input or draws text,
you'll need to understand Xlib's internationalization features.ID="S2-1013-14-9"String Encoding and Locale Dependencies in XtID="IX-1013-14-187"X Toolkitand locale dependenciesID="IX-1013-14-188"X Toolkitand string encodingID="IX-1013-14-189"string encodingsin the X ToolkitID="IX-1013-14-190"localedependencies in X ToolkitThe X Toolkit specification has not been so thoroughly
revised as the Xlib spec to make explicit the expected
encodings of all strings.  Generally, it will be true
that Xt variables or arguments of type String should be in
the encoding
of the locale, but caution is necessary:  the widget
name passed to XtCreateWidget() is of type
String, for example, but since it may be used
in resource specifications it should be in the Host
Portable Character Encoding if the application is to
operate in more than a single locale.  Neither is the specification
explicit
about such
ID="IX-1013-14-191"translation tablesencoding
things as the encoding of translation tables or the
localized behavior of resource converters like
XtCvtStringToBoolean.  None of these are
critical problems; the Xt programmer who wishes to
write internationalized applications should be aware,
however, that there are internationalization issues
in Xt that remain to be worked out.ID="S2-1013-14-10"Establishing Locale in an Xt ApplicationID="IX-1013-14-192"X Toolkitlocale, establishingID="IX-1013-14-193"localeestablishing;in X ToolkitResource specifications in X11R5 are parsed in the
current locale, which means that an application should
have established its locale before reading its
app-defaults file and creating its resource database.
However, it should be possible to specify the locale
for an application using a resource, which means that
the resources should be read before the locale is set.
The Intrinsics as of X11R5 resolves this catch-22 by parsing
resources in two steps:  first it scans the command line and per-display
resource string for the setting of the locale, then, once the
locale is set, it fully parses all the resource specifications.ID="IX-1013-14-194"resourcesand specifying localesThe locale and resource initialization sequence is as
follows:NUMERATION="ARABIC"ID="IX-1013-14-195"language proceduresregisteringID="IX-1013-14-196"registering language proceduresID="IX-1013-14-197"XtSetLanguageProc
The application starts up in the default locale.
The programmer does not call setlocale, but
registers a language procedure
by calling XtSetLanguageProc().
This language procedure will later be called to set the locale.The application then typically calls XtInitialize() or
XtAppInitialize() or XtOpenDisplay().
These initialization routines call
XtDisplayInitialize() which scans (but doesn't
actually parse--this scan is done in a way that is
independent of the initial locale of the process) the
command line and the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of
the default screen for
ID="IX-1013-14-198"xnlLanguageID="IX-1013-14-199"-xnlLanguage optionID="IX-1013-14-200"native language optionID="IX-1013-14-201"XnlLanguage
the value of the xnlLanguage resource.  (The
class of this resource is XnlLanguage, and it
can be set from the command line using the -xnlLanguage
option.  The "nl" stands for "native language.")
The
language string obtained from this resource (or the
empty string if the resource doesn't exist) is passed
to the language procedure registered with
XtSetLanguageProc().  If no language procedure
ID="IX-1013-14-202"XtSetLanguageProc
was registered, XtDisplayInitialize()
continues exactly as it did in X11R4.The language procedure uses the passed string to set
the locale.  Note that the language procedure can pass
the empty string directly to setlocale which
will take it as a signal to set the locale based on the
value of the appropriate operating system environment
variable.  The language procedure should also call
XSupportsLocale() to verify that the locale is
supported and XSetLocaleModifiers() to set any
locale modifiers.  Finally, the language procedure must
return the name of the locale it set (which is the
return value of setlocale).Now XtDisplayInitialize() saves the return value
of the language procedure for use by
XtResolvePathname() as a pathname substitution
when searching for the appropriate application defaults file for
the locale.Note that XtDisplayInitialize() could make the
call to setlocale itself, but that this was
deemed inappropriate by the designers.  If no language
procedure is registered, XtDisplayInitialize()
behaves as it did in X11R4, and the locale is never
set.  For most applications
the default language procedure will be sufficient: it calls
setlocale, XSupportsLocale(), and
XSetLocaleModifiers() and it returns the name of the
locale it set.  Note that the default procedure is not
actually registered by default; you must explicitly
register it or you will get X11R4 behavior.  To register it, 
call XtSetLanguageProc() with a 
procedure argument of NULL.

for internationalized text output will be an important
resource for any internationalized widget that draws
text.  The purpose of the XFontSet is as follows.
An application needs more than
one X font in order to operate in a language like Japanese.
In Japanese, any useful text-based application needs a
Kanji font (final symbols), a Katakana font (phonetic font used in
typing), and an English font (for specialized terms) at the same
time.  So these are grouped together and called one XFontSet.The X11R5 Xt Intrinsics give XFontSet
almost the same support they give the
XFontStruct.  They define:MARK="BULLET"XtNfontSet, a name for an XFontSet
resource.XtCFontSet, a class for an XFontSet resource.XtRFontSet, the representation type for an
XFontSet resource.A pre-registered String-to-XFontSet converter.XtDefaultFontSet, a string constant guaranteed
to work with the pre-registered String-to-XFontSet converter.When the constant XtDefaultFontSet is passed to
the pre-registered String-to-XFontSet converter, it
queries the resource database for the value of a
resource with name xtDefaultFontSet and class
XtDefaultFontSet.  If this resource exists and
has a valid value, the XFontSet is created
using the resource value as the base font name list.
If the resource doesn't exist or no font set can be
created from it, the converter falls back onto an
implementation-defined default font set list.ID="IX-1013-14-209"-font optionlack ofUnfortunately there is no standard command-line
option analogous to -font defined by the
Xt Intrinsics which will set this
xtDefaultFontSet resource.  Applications can
provide this command-line option themselves, or a user can
ID="IX-1013-14-210"-xrm option
specify a font set with the -xrm option:ID="SC-1013-14-5"imail -xrm "*xtDefaultFontSet: -*-*-*-R-*-*-*-140-100-100-*-*-*-*"ID="S2-1013-14-12"Other Xt Changes for InternationalizationThe three other changes to Xt for internationalization
are as follows:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1013-14-211"error messageslocalization ofID="IX-1013-14-212"localizationof error messagesID="IX-1013-14-213"XtErrorDB~file
To allow the localization of error messages, the
high-level Xt error and warning handling routines are
no longer required to use the single file
/usr/lib/X11/XtErrorDB (on POSIX systems) as the error
message database.  Unfortunately, the app-context based
design of the error and warning handlers means that
these handers are not passed a handle to the Display
that the error occurred on.  This implies that they cannot
use XtResolvePathname() (which requires the display to
look up the language string to use in path
substitutions) to find an appropriate error
database for the locale.  For this reason X11R5 does not
specify a standard error database search path, but
simply states that the source of the error and warning
message text is implementation-dependent.  What this
means to the programmer of internationalized
applications is that you cannot portably rely on the default
high-level Xt warning and error handlers to find the
localized text of your error messages.  You should
register an error handler of your own or display your
error messages through some entirely different mechanism.ID="IX-1013-14-214"xnlLanguageID="IX-1013-14-215"language strings
X11R4 specified that the language string obtained from
the xnlLanguage resource should be in the form:language[_territory][.codeset]This was deemed an unnecessary restriction, and for X11R5 the
specification has been changed to state that the
language string (obtained from the
xnlLanguage resource or returned by the new
language procedure) has a "language part," a "territory
part," and a "codeset part," but that the format of the
string is implementation-dependent.ID="IX-1013-14-216"input methodsand text internationalizationThe internationalization of X text input with input
methods (see Xlib) requires that an input method
have a way to intercept X events before they are
processed by the application.  An input method does
this by registering an event filter, and all
applications that perform internationalized text input
are required to call the function XFilterEvent()
each time they receive an event.  To support
ID="IX-1013-14-217"XtDispatchEvent
internationalized input, XtDispatchEvent() has
been modified to make this required call to
XFilterEvent().  Furthermore, if an event arrives
that triggers a grab registered by XtGrabButton()
or XtGrabKey(), and that event is filtered by
XFilterEvent(), then XtDispatchEvent() breaks
the grab by calling XtUngrabPointer() or
XtUngrabKeyboard() with the timestamp of the
event.  This is done because when an input method
filters an event, the application should behave as if
that event never arrived.ID="S2-1013-14-13"Internationalization in Motif 1.2Since Motif 1.2 is built upon the R5 version of the Xt
Intrinsics, it has the same internationalization features.
In addition, however, Motif widgets that handle text have been
reimplemented to support wide character and multi-byte strings.ID="S2-1013-14-14"Text OutputThe Motif 1.2 XmFontList can contain
XFontSets as well as XFontStructs.  The 1.2
XmString drawing functions use the new X11R5
internationalized Xlib text drawing functions when they encounter
an XFontSet in an XmFontList.  In this way,
text display in all Motif widgets except Text and
TextField has been internationalized.  Note that
XmStrings can only be created from multi-byte
strings; there is no wide-character XmString
creation function.The XmString and XmFontList API have
changed; see below.ID="S2-1013-14-15"Text InputThe Text and TextField widgets have been extensively
re-written in Motif 1.2 to support internationalized text
input and output based on the X11R5 mechanisms.
Fortunately, the complexity of Xlib internationalization is
almost entirely hidden by these widgets.The text widgets have a new resource XmNvalueWcs
which expects a wide-character string value, and also
support a number of new callbacks which return text in
wide-character form.  The existing resources and callbacks
remain to support multi-byte strings.  Programmers may use
whichever style is more convenient for their application.Much of the interaction with the X Input Method is handled
by the Motif VendorShell widget.  It supports two new
resources, XmNinputMethod and XmNpreeditType,
which specify locale modifiers with which to select the
input method and the preedit interaction style desired.
When input method preedit or status information must be
displayed in "off-the-spot" style at the bottom of the
application window, the VendorShell widget provides and
manages this space.ID="S2-1013-14-16"Compound Text ConversionCompound Text is the X Consortium standard for inter-client
communication of internationalized text.  When performing
cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop in an internationalized
application, it may be necessary to convert 
between XmStrings and
Compound Text.  Motif 1.2 provides 2 new functions to do
this:  XmCvtXmStringToCT() and
XmCvtCTToXmString().ID="S2-1013-14-17"_XmGetLocalized()Motif 1.2 contains a new function, _XmGetLocalized()
intended for use by widget writers to obtain localized
equivalents for common strings such as "Ok", "Cancel", and "Help".ID="S2-1013-14-18"SummaryMotif 1.2 makes internationalization nearly transparent.  To
write an internationalized application with Motif, do the
following:MARK="BULLET"Place all strings and pixmaps in resource or UIL files.Specify a generic font set in your XmFontLists.Do not use multiple charset tags in your XmStrings.Call XtSetLanguageProc(NULL, NULL, NULL);

well on existing generic US platforms.  Operating system support for
locales and internationalization is also required.ID="AX-1013-A-1" NUMBER="A"Athena, OPEN LOOK, and MotifAppendix A: Athena, OPEN LOOK, and MotifThis appendix gives an overview of the widgets available in the
Sun's OPEN LOOK widget set (also known as OLIT, the OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit) and the OSF/Motif widget
set.  It gives
a sense of the look and feel of applications developed with each set,
and provides the inheritance hierarchy and overview of the available
widgets.This section provides an overview and comparison of the widgets
in MIT's Athena widget set, Sun's OPEN LOOK widget set (also known as OLIT),

test and demonstrate the Xt Intrinsics.  They are used as the
basis for some of the standard MIT clients and many public
domain applications, but are not expected to be used for most
commercial applications because Xaw is not a complete environment.A number of vendors have developed proprietary widget sets.  For
example, Sony Microsystems offers S-windows, a widget set for its
News workstations.  However, given that one of the purposes of
widgets is to provide a common look and feel for X applications,
it is natural there should be a shakeout as vendors align
themselves with one or two major contenders.ID="IX-1013-A-1"inheritanceamong OPEN LOOK widgetsID="IX-1013-A-2"inheritanceamong Motif widgets
As it has turned out, the two major contenders for a graphical
user-interface standard, OPEN LOOK and Motif,
are put forth by the two major contenders
for an underlying UNIX operating system standard, AT&T and the
Open Software Foundation.It is theoretically possible to write
an application that will run under either of these widget sets,
using one set of source code interspersed with #ifdef
symbols for conditional compilation.  This becomes difficult when
you use any of the Xt-level features Motif alone provides, however.OPEN LOOK is somewhat unusual in that it started out not as a set
of widgets, but as a user-interface specification.  The
specification, originally developed by Sun Microsystems with AT&T
backing, was widely circulated for comment before any
implementations were begun.  The objective was to develop a graphical
user-interface standard for UNIX workstations--one that would be
implementation-independent, and, it was hoped, implemented
separately by many different vendors.At present, the two major implementations of OPEN LOOK are
Sun's XView toolkit (which is not based on Xt, but instead
provides an application-programmer's interface similar to Sun's
proprietary SunView windowing system), and AT&T's OPEN LOOK
Xt-based widget set.  XView is on the R4 distribution from
MIT.  Both of these toolkits will be available to
all AT&T UNIX System V Release 4 licensees.  In our discussions,
we are referring specifically to AT&T's OPEN LOOK toolkit, which
does not necessarily include every OPEN LOOK feature.
Nor should
its implementation be considered the only way to provide features
called for by OPEN LOOK.The Open Software Foundation's Motif toolkit is based on a
combination of widget sets originally developed by two OSF
sponsors, Digital and Hewlett Packard.  The look and feel of the
widget set was proposed by HP/Microsoft.  It is designed to emulate the
look and feel of the IBM/Microsoft Presentation Manager standard
widely expected to be adopted in the microcomputer world.

widgets.0Comparable widgets share a line in the table.
Widgets for which no equivalent occurs in a given set are
indicated by a hyphen in the appropriate column.  Note that
comparisons are approximate only, since widgets have complex
behavior that may distinguish them significantly from another widget
with an ostensibly similar purpose.The following sections provide an overview of the widgets
available in the OPEN LOOK and Motif widget sets.  Throughout,
we contrast them with the Athena widgets, which have been
used as examples in this book, to give you an idea of the
additional features provided by the commercial widget sets.Keep in mind that the look and feel of an application is controlled by
the window manager as well as by the widget set.  Both AT&T and
OSF supply window managers to complement their widgets.Note that both widget sets make additions to the basic X Toolkit API.
In the AT&T OPEN LOOK widget set, these API additions are rather
minor.  There is one essential function,
OlInitialize, which sets initial values needed by other
routines and by certain widgets.  OlInitialize creates a
base window, which from the programmer's point of view is
identical to the Intrinsics-supplied TopLevelShell widget class,
but which automatically handles certain features of the OPEN LOOK
interface.
There are also several
convenience functions, mostly having to do with conversions between
pixel sizes and various standard units.  More importantly, there
is a facility for registering help screens for each element in an
application.In addition, Motif makes heavy use of convenience functions.
Rather than using XtCreateManagedWidget() to create
each widget, there is a separate creation routine for each
widget.  In some cases, a convenience routine creates more than
one widget.
Rather than using separate calls to XtCreatePopupShell() and
XtCreateManagedWidget() to create
a popup shell and the dialog box it displays, you might call a
function such as XmCreateMessageDialog() to create both
widgets at once.  Some convenience routines create special
configurations of a single, complex widget (e.g., a composite
widget with specific children.)In Motif, all resources are
referred to by names beginning with XmN or XmC
rather than the familiar XtN and XtC.Motif also uses the call_data argument of callback functions
extensively.  Almost every widget has
a structure defined as widgetclassCallbackStruct (e.g.,
XmToggleButtonCallbackStruct).  This struct contains different
fields for each widget, but each contains a field called
reason.  The reason field defines which callback has
been called.  So using this feature allows you to have a single piece of code
to handle all callbacks for a widget.Both Motif and OPEN LOOK offer clear advantages over Xaw.  Unfortunately,
however, the choice of which
one to use may depend on company marketing goals and
politics rather than on clear technical merit.  We encourage
independent developers to try both and to base your opinions on the ease of
programming and the preferences of your users, rather than on
marketing hype by one side or the other.  Both Motif and OPEN LOOK
come with their own window manager and have defined their own
protocols for communication between their Shell widgets and
their window manager.  By setting resources of Shell widgets
you can control some aspects of how these window managers will
handle your application.ID="S1-1013-A-1"The AT&T OPEN LOOK WidgetsID="IX-1013-A-8" SPAN="START"OPEN LOOK widgetsID="IX-1013-A-9" SPAN="START"widgetssets; OPEN LOOKLINKEND="FG-1013-A-1"Figure A-1 shows the overall look and feel of an OPEN LOOK application.ID="FG-1013-A-1"An OPEN LOOK applicationFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-4"ID="IX-1013-A-10"OPEN LOOKapplication's look and feelThe base window of an application always has these elements:MARK="BULLET"A title bar, or header, with a title supplied by the application centered
in the bar.  The title might be the application name, or the name
of a file being edited.  If the application doesn't provide a title,
the title bar displays the string "Untitled."A "window mark" on the left side of the title bar.  If the user
clicks on this mark with the first (leftmost) pointer button, the window
closes.A window menu that comes up automatically when you click on the
title bar with the third (rightmost) pointer button.One or more panes for input and display of application data.One or more control areas, containing buttons that invoke
application actions or menus containing additional actions.
Control areas can be horizontal, vertical, or both.Optional elements include resize corners (which allow the user
to resize the application by
dragging them with the first pointer button), horizontal and/or
vertical scrollbars, and a footer area for displaying messages.Some of these elements do not correspond to widgets, but are
produced by the OPEN LOOK window manager, olwm, as window
decoration.  For example, the header, including title bar, window mark
and window menu, are provided by the window manager, as are the
optional resize corners.  However, control areas, panes, scrollbars, and
the footer area do correspond to particular widgets.In addition to base windows, applications may have
several kinds of popup.  Both pulldown and pure popup
menus are supported, as well as several standard kinds of notices
and dialogs.  Probably OPEN LOOK's best-known feature is
the "pushpin" metaphor that allows
frequently-accessed popup menus to be kept on the screen rather
than hidden again after they have been used.The following sections discuss some of the widgets AT&T has
provided to support the OPEN LOOK user interface.
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-2"Figure A-2 shows the overall widget inheritance hierarchy.Note that there are a number of widgets that are never
instantiated by the application programmer, but are used by other
widgets.  For example, the checkbox is actually a
composite widget that manages a check widget as its child!
The Pushpin used in popups and the Magnifier used in Help windows
(and the Help window itself) are examples of other widgets that
are not instantiated directly.ID="S2-1013-A-1"Application ControlsMost applications will have at least one control area, with
pointer-selectable buttons that invoke commands or menus, or
choose settings.ID="IX-1013-A-11" SPAN="START"commandcommand widgets; OPEN LOOKID="IX-1013-A-12" SPAN="START"OPEN LOOK widgetscommand
One of the areas where OPEN LOOK clearly stands out over the
Athena widgets is in the rich set of controls it provides.
Athena has one kind of Command widget; OPEN LOOK has six.ID="S3-1013-A-1"Command ButtonsID="IX-1013-A-13"commandcommand buttonsID="IX-1013-A-14"buttonscommand buttonsThe Athena Command widget implements one of the most basic
user-interface idioms--a button that invokes an action when you
click on it with the pointer.  The Athena widgets include
a subclass of Command, the MenuButton widget, which includes code for
placing a popup menu.ID="FG-1013-A-2"Class inheritance hierarchy of the AT&T OPEN LOOK widgetsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-5"ID="IX-1013-A-15"inheritanceamong OPEN LOOK widgetsThe OPEN LOOK widget set implements similar functions using
the OblongButton and ButtonStack widgets.
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-3"Figure A-3 shows a Control Area containing OblongButton and ButtonStack
widgets.ID="FG-1013-A-3"An OPEN LOOK ControlArea with OblongButton and ButtonStack widgetsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.03.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-6"The OblongButton widget provides many niceties lacking from the
Athena Command widget.  One of the most important is that OblongButton
has a resource that allows one button among several to be designated as the
default, in which case the button is bordered by a double line,
to give the user immediate visual feedback about which button to
choose when several are available.The OblongButton also has the notion of a "busy"state in which it cannot perform the action because it is already
doing it.  (This is different from a widget that is insensitive
(meaning its function is unavailable), though in practice the
effect is quite similar.)  The label and border of an insensitive button
are dimmed; the background of a
busy button is filled with a stippled pattern.The ButtonStack widget is similar to the OblongButton but
invokes a menu rather than a single command.  Clicking on it
with one mouse button (usually Button 3) pops up a
menu (which may in turn include other ButtonStack widgets, for
cascading popups.)  Clicking on the ButtonStack with another mouse
button (usually Button 1) activates the default item for the menu.
Visually, a ButtonStack is differentiated from an OblongButton by
the presence of an arrowhead that points in the direction that the
menu will pop up.LINKEND="FN-1013-A-2"ID="FN-1013-A-2"In an earlier implementation of the toolkit,
a ButtonStack widget had a double border
on its bottom half, giving it the appearance of a stack of
regular buttons.  Hence its name, which is now merely historical.In addition, there is an AbbrevStack widget, which performs similar
functions as the ButtonStack widget, but shows up only as a small
unlabelled box with the default choice for the menu displayed
beside it.ID="S3-1013-A-2"Exclusive and Nonexclusive SettingsID="IX-1013-A-16"commandcommand buttonsThe Athena Toggle widget provides the concept of a button that
establishes a setting (for example, sets an application resource)
instead of performing an action.  It highlights itself when selected,
but remains highlighted until selected again.  However, in the Athena
Widget set, there is no visual distinction between a Command widget
and a Toggle widget.
ID="IX-1013-A-17" SPAN="END"commandcommand widgets; OPEN LOOKID="IX-1013-A-18" SPAN="END"OPEN LOOK widgetscommandOPEN LOOK provides such a distinction.  In contrast to OblongButton, which
always indicates that an action will be performed, a RectButton indicates
that an option setting will be chosen.  This setting may be exclusive or
nonexclusive, as determined by the RectButton widget itself,
depending on whether the widget is managed by an Exclusives,
or Nonexclusives composite widget.  The RectButton widget class will not
work correctly unless managed by one of these two composite
widgets.  The Exclusives and Nonexclusives widgets are themselves
usually children of a Menu or ControlArea widget.
ID="IX-1013-A-19"widgetsExclusives and NonexclusivesIn an Exclusives widget, RectButton widgets are laid out side by
side in one or more columns.  One or none of the RectButton
widgets is chosen as the default, which is indicated by a double
border.  Once a RectButton is selected, it is shown with a dark
border.  The Exclusives widget makes sure that no more than one
RectButton is selected at a time.In a Nonexclusives widget, RectButtons are displayed with
separation between each button.  As when used in an Exclusives
widget, a dark border indicates that the option has been chosen.
However, more than one button may be chosen at a time.LINKEND="FG-1013-A-4"Figure A-4 shows examples of exclusive and nonexclusive settings on menus.
Note that, like
the OblongButton, a RectButton may display a pixmap instead of a
label.  This makes the RectButton useful for a palette in a paint
program.ID="FG-1013-A-4"OPEN LOOK RectButtons controlled by Exclusives and Nonexclusives widgetsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.04.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-7"The CheckBox widget provides an alternate way to display
nonexclusive settings to the user.  It displays a small box next to
the label and displays a checkmark in the box when the option is
selected.  Checkboxes appear in ControlAreas rather than on menus.
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-5"Figure A-5 shows examples of CheckBox widgets.ID="FG-1013-A-5"An OPEN LOOK CheckBox widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.05.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-8"ID="S3-1013-A-3"Analog ControlsIn addition to the various kinds of buttons outlined above, OPEN LOOK provides an analog control called a Slider.
A Slider widget is used analogously to a Scrollbar but is used
for setting a numeric value.
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-6"Figure A-6 shows a Slider widget.ID="FG-1013-A-6"An OPEN LOOK Slider widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.06.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-9"ID="S2-1013-A-2"Composite WidgetsID="IX-1013-A-20"composite widgetsimportanceComposite widgets are in many ways the most important widgets in
any widget set.  They define the way that widgets work
together, and they give consistency to an application.ID="S3-1013-A-4"Menus and Control AreasID="IX-1013-A-21"menusaboutAs we've already discussed,
command buttons of any kind are usually displayed as part of a menu or
control area.Menus can either pop up below a ButtonStack or
an AbbrevStack, or
if the button is itself displayed on a menu, to the right, in a
menu cascade.
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-4"Figure A-4 showed examples of menus.The Menu widget is a popup widget created with
XtCreatePopupShell().  It has a single child, which is
a ControlArea widget.The ControlArea widget
places its children in rows or columns.  Resources allow the application
to specify a fixed width and/or height, or a fixed number of rows
or columns.  ControlArea widgets are usually used as the parent
of OblongButton, ButtonStack, Exclusives, or Nonexclusives widgets
(which in turn manage RectButton widgets, as described in the
next section).ID="S3-1013-A-5"General Purpose Composite WidgetsID="IX-1013-A-22"composite widgetsgeneral purposeWe've already discussed the Composite widgets relating to control
areas and menus.  However, there are several general-purpose
composite widgets in the OPEN LOOK set as well.ID="IX-1013-A-23"BulletinBoard widgetThe BulletinBoard widget provides a free-form area for placing
subwindows.  Widgets can be placed on a BulletinBoard at
arbitrary x and y coordinates; if no coordinates are specified,
they appear in the upper left corner.  The BulletinBoard provides
no management of its children, and is often used to establish the
base frame for an application, since it allows the application
programmer to place the major components of the application,
rather than having to go by some Composite widget's arbitrary
placement decisions.A BulletinBoard is often used as the main window of an
application.ID="IX-1013-A-24"Form widgetaboutThe Form widget is a constraint widget similar to
the Athena Form widget.  It allows the placement of widgets to be
specified relative to each other, and with rules governing their
separation or relative position.ID="IX-1013-A-25"Caption widgetThe Caption widget is like an Athena Label
widget turned inside out.  Like the Label widget, it prints a string.
However, while the label widget's string is printed inside a
visible widget border, a Caption string appears outside a
bordered area.  Caption
is a composite widget class, and its
label typically refers to a child widget of any size, which the Caption
widget manages.  The label can be aligned on either the right,
left, top or bottom of the child widget.The FooterPanel widget provides a consistent method for placing a
footer along the bottom of another window.  The footer panel
takes two children.  The top child is typically the main
composite widget of the application; the bottom widget may
contain a control or message area.  The basic feature of the
FooterPanel widget is that when the widget is resized, it applies
all the change in the vertical direction to the top child,
maintaining the bottom child at a constant height.ID="S3-1013-A-6"Scrollbars and Scrollable WindowsID="IX-1013-A-26"scrollbarsaboutOPEN LOOK scrollbars use the visual metaphor of an elevator on a
cable, but functionally they are similar to the
Athena Scrollbar widget.  The drag area (the thumb in an Athena
Scrollbar widget) doesn't change size; instead, as shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-7"Figure A-7, there is a separate area that indicates the proportion of the
data that is currently being displayed.ID="FG-1013-A-7"An OPEN LOOK ScrollbarFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.07.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-10"Scrollbars may be oriented either horizontally or vertically.Scrollbars are used as a component of a ScrolledWindow widget,
which, like the Athena Viewport widget, provides a scrollable view of a data
area in a child widget.  The child widget is typically larger
than the view area, but only the area in the parent's view area can be
seen at any one time.
LINKEND="FG-1013-A-1"Figure A-1 showed a ScrolledWindow widget as the main application
pane.
The ScrollingList widget displays a scrollable list of editable text fields,
and provides facilities for choosing and displaying one of the
fields as "currently selected."  Items can be selected from the
list, changed, copied, and so on.  This widget is useful for
providing an interface to select a file for reading or writing.LINKEND="FG-1013-A-8"Figure A-8 shows a ScrollingList widget.ID="FG-1013-A-8"An OPEN LOOK ScrollingList widgetFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.08.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-11"ID="S2-1013-A-3"PopupsID="IX-1013-A-27"popup widgetsOPEN LOOKID="IX-1013-A-28"OPEN LOOKpopup widgetsIn addition to Menu widgets, the OPEN LOOK widget set contains three
other special types of popup widgets: Notices, PopupWindows, and
Help windows.
A Notice is
used to request confirmation or other information from the user.
The widget contains a text area, where the message to the user is
displayed, and a control area containing one or more buttons, one
of which must be the default button.LINKEND="FG-1013-A-9"Figure A-9 shows an OPEN LOOK Notice widget.ID="FG-1013-A-9"An OPEN LOOK NoticeFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.09.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-12"A Notice grabs the pointer.  The only input allowed is to the
Notice.  Once the user has clicked a button, the Notice
disappears.The second special popup type is a PopupWindow, which can be
used for more complex popups.  Unlike a Notice, which is a
subclass of OverrideShell, a PopupWindowShell
is a subclass of WMShell, and so is decorated by the window
manager.  It
has all the visual attributes of a top-level window, including
resize corners, etc.
In addition, it displays a pushpin in the upper left corner.
If the user clicks on the pushpin with the pointer, the menu
doesn't go away when its action has been performed, but stays on
the screen.  This allows the user to keep menus (and other
frequently-referenced popups, such as help screens) "pinned" on
the display, where they can be moved like regular windows.
(Menus can also display a pushpin; its presence or absence is
controlled by a widget resource.)A PopupWindow typically contains an upper control area that may
include menus, and a lower control area that may be used for
buttons invoking widget actions.
Resources allow for automatic creation of several
buttons, including a "reset to factory" button, a "set defaults"button, and several other ways of setting standard properties for
an application.LINKEND="FG-10130-A-10"Figure A-10 shows a PopupWindow.ID="FG-10130-A-10"An OPEN LOOK PopupWindowFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.10.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-13"A Help window is not instantiated in the usual way.  Instead, an
application uses the OlRegisterHelp function to register
help text with the toolkit.  Text can be associated with a widget
class, a widget instance, or a window.  When the user clicks the
second pointer button on an object, the Help widget is
automatically displayed by the toolkit.  The Help widget includes
a Magnifier subwidget, which displays a magnifying glass
containing an image of the part of the screen on which the user
clicked the pointer.
LINKEND="FG-10130-A-11"Figure A-11 shows a Help window.ID="FG-10130-A-11"An OPEN LOOK Help windowFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.11.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-14"ID="S2-1013-A-4"Text WidgetsID="IX-1013-A-29"Text widgetOPEN LOOK text widgetsID="IX-1013-A-30"OPEN LOOK widgetstextOPEN LOOK offers three separate text widgets.  The StaticText
widget is similar to the Athena Label widget in that it displays
a fixed text string.  However, it can handle longer strings by
using wordwrapping to break the string onto multiple lines.The OPEN LOOK Text widget is very similar to the Athena Text widget.
It provides a general-purpose editable text widget, with editing
commands customizable via a translation table.One of the annoying weaknesses of the Athena Text widget is that it
is difficult and inefficient to use as a single-line editable field.
(A program
can add translations for the Return key to limit the text to a
single line.)  OPEN LOOK addresses this need with the TextField
widget, useful for developing form-driven applications.
TextField widgets were shown in
LINKEND="FG-10130-A-11"Figure A-11.The TextField widget provides simple editing commands, and scrolling
if the string is too long to be displayed.  When the keyboard focus
leaves the widget, or when the Tab or Return key is pressed, it passes
the data in the field to the application for validation.ID="S2-1013-A-5"Drawing AreasLike the Athena widget set, the AT&T OPEN LOOK widgets provide no
widget explicitly labeled as a drawing area.  As described in
this book, one is expected either to create a custom widget for
an application's main window, or to use a very basic widget
class, and add actions for drawing.The AT&T OPEN LOOK widget set does include a Stub widget class
(which is not documented in the manual, but is included in the
source), which is useful for providing a window for drawing.

widgets in other sets.The DrawnButton works similarly, but allows the programmer to provide
a pixmap for the appearance of the button.LINKEND="FG-10130-A-14"Figure A-14 shows a DrawnButton and a PushButton.ID="FG-10130-A-14"Motif DrawnButton and PushButton widgetsFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.14.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-17"The CascadeButton is similar in effect to OPEN LOOK's
ButtonStack--it can have a particular appearance that indicates that a
menu is invoked, rather than a single callback.  Typically, this
is simply an arrow pointing in the direction where the menu will

RectButton or CheckBox.

widgets into three areas: Menus and Control Areas,
General-Purpose Composite Widgets, and Scrollable Windows.
These distinctions are somewhat arbitrary and with menus the sections
overlap with the one on popups, which appears later.ID="S3-1013-A-9"Menus and Control AreasID="IX-1013-A-42"composite widgetsmenus and control areasMotif provides a special Shell widget class called MenuShell for
managing popup menus.  However, most actual menu displays are
managed by the RowColumn composite widget, which, like OPEN LOOK's ControlArea, displays buttons in rows or columns.Through resources, the RowColumn widget can be configured to
create such specialized, predefined elements as a MenuBar (which
can only accept CascadeButton widgets as children), several
different styles of pulldown or popup menu panes, and several
preconfigured control areas, such as a "Radio Box" containing
multiple exclusive ToggleButton gadgets.Here you can begin to see the wide divergence in programming
style made possible by the Xt Intrinsics.  It is possible to
create a hierarchy of relatively simple widgets to perform
separate parts of a task, or a single, very complex widget which
is highly configurable.  In one of its incarnations, the RowColumn
widget is equivalent to an OPEN LOOK ControlArea plus an
Exclusives widget; in another, a ControlArea plus a
Nonexclusives.In general, Motif widgets are more complex and have many more
resources than widgets provided in other widget sets.  To
simplify their use, though, Motif provides numerous convenience
functions.  For example, XmCreateRadioBox() will create a
RowColumn widget with one specialized set of resources, while
XmCreateMenuBar() will create one that is entirely
different in appearance and function.LINKEND="FG-10130-A-15"Figure A-15 shows a RowColumn widget configured as a MenuBar and

the menu and releasing it when the chosen item is highlighted.
Alternately, the pointer can simply be clicked on the menu title to drop
down the menu.  
Clicking on an item in the menu selects it;
clicking anywhere other than in the menu pops the menu down
without executing any item.Note also
that as a general feature, Motif menus support accelerators.
That is, there are keyboard equivalents for every menu item.
These keyboard accelerators are listed after the menu label, as shown
above.  In
addition, typing the underlined letter in any menu item label
when the pointer is in the menu will select that menu item.  These underlined letters are called "mnemonics."The items on a menubar or menu pane simply appear as labels but when
selected take on the 3-D appearance of a PushButton.ID="FG-10130-A-17"A Motif RowColumn widget configured as a drop-down windowFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="a.17.gif" ID="GC-1013-A-20"ID="S3-1013-A-10"General Purpose Composite WidgetsID="IX-1013-A-43"composite widgetsgeneral purposeThe BulletinBoard widget provides simple composite management,

slider that can be dragged up and down to scroll the associated
window.  You can also click above or below the thumb to move it a
screenful at a time.  Unlike the Athena widget, it also displays arrows at
either end that can be used to scroll line by line.  The
associated window scrolls in the indicated direction as long as
the pointer button is held down in one of the arrows.There are several different types of scrolling windows.  The
ScrolledWindow widget, like Athena's Viewport, provides a general
mechanism for attaching scrollbars to some other window.The MainWindow widget is a subclass of ScrolledWindow with a
special appearance reserved for application main windows.
LINKEND="FG-10130-A-14"Figure A-14 showed a MainWindow widget.Using the XmCreateScrolledList() function, a List widget
can be created as a child of a ScrolledWindow, giving the effect
of a simple scrolled list.  In addition, there are several
flavors of more complex scrolling lists.
These include the SelectionBox widget, and its two subclasses, 
Command and FileSelectionBox.A general-purpose SelectionBox is akin to a ScrolledWindow/List
combination, but adds a Text widget for
entering additional data not on the list. The SelectionBox
also adds at least three buttons labeled by default OK,
Cancel, and Help.LINKEND="FG-10130-A-20"Figure A-20  shows a SelectionBox.A FileSelectionBox is a SelectionBox specially designed to

their composite children.For example, functions exist to create a DialogShell with
a variety of pre-configured MessageBox widgets as the visible child.As we've already discussed, a specially configured RowColumn

class answers this need in Motif.  It provides a window for
drawing and provides very simple, bulletin-board like composite
management of children.Though the name of this widget class sounds promising,
you should be aware that Motif
really provides no more sophisticated drawing capabilities than
Athena or the AT&T OPEN LOOK widget set.  In each case, once you

Note that the RGB values in the color database provided by MIT
are correct for only one type of display; you may find that the
color you get is not exactly what you expect given the name.
To combat this, vendors may have corrected the RGB values to give
colors closer to what the name implies.  Or they may provide a
device-independent color database.  See Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual or
The X Color Management System for more
on device-independent color specification.At the command line, a color name should be typed as a single word
(for example, darkslategray).
However, you can type the words
comprising a color name separately if you enclose them in quotes, as
in the following command line:ID="SC-1013-B-4"% xterm -bg "light blue" -fg "dark slate gray" -bd plum &ID="S2-1013-B-2"Hexadecimal Color SpecificationID="IX-1013-B-7"colorhexadecimal specificationID="IX-1013-B-8"hexadecimal color specificationYou can also specify colors more exactly using a hexadecimal color
string.  You probably won't use this method unless you require a color
not available by using a color name.  This method is not
recommended in R5 and later: use the device-independent style
specification
instead.  Moreover, you shouldn't use
this method unless necessary because it tends to discourage the sharing
of colors between applications.  In order to understand how this
works, you may need a little background on how color is implemented
on most workstations.ID="S3-1013-B-1"The RGB Color ModelID="IX-1013-B-9"colorRGB modelID="IX-1013-B-10" SPAN="START"RGB color modelMost color displays on the market today are based on the RGB color
model.  Each pixel on the screen is actually made up of three
phosphors:  one red, one green, and one blue.  Each of these three
phosphors is excited by a separate electron beam.  When all three
phosphors are fully illuminated, the pixel appears white to
the human eye.  When all three are dark, the pixel appears black.
When the illumination of each primary color varies, the three
phosphors generate a subtractive color.  For example, equal
portions of red and green, with no admixture of blue, makes yellow.As you might guess, the intensity of each primary color is controlled
by a three-part digital value--and it is the exact makeup of this
value that the hexadecimal specification allows you to set.Depending on the underlying hardware, different servers may use a
larger or smaller number of bits (from 4 to 16 bits) to describe the
intensity of each primary.  To insulate you from this variation,
clients are designed to take color values containing
anywhere from 4 to 16 bits (1 to 4 hex digits), and the server then scales them to
the hardware.  As a result, you can specify hexadecimal values in any
one of the following formats:ID="SC-1013-B-5"#RGB
#RRGGBB
#RRRGGGBBB
#RRRRGGGGBBBBwhere R, G, and B represent single hexadecimal digits and determine
the intensity of the red, green, and blue primaries that make up
each color.When fewer
than four digits are used, they represent the most significant bits of
the value.  For example, #3a6 is the same as
#3000a0006000.What this means concretely is perhaps best illustrated by looking at
the values that correspond to some colors in the color name database.
We'll use 8-bit values (two hexadecimal digits for each primary)
because that is the way they are defined in the rgb.txt file:ID="SC-1013-B-6"#000000      black
#FCFCFC      white
#FF0000      red
#00FF00      green
#0000FF      blue
#FFFF00      yellow
#00FFFF      cyan
#FF00FF      magenta
#5F9F9F      cadet blue
#42426F      cornflower blue
#BFD8D8      light blue
#8F8FBC      light steel blue
#3232CC      medium blue
#23238E      navy blue
#3299CC      sky blue
#007FFF      slate blue
#236B8E      steel blueAs you can see from the colors given above, pure red, green, and blue
result from the corresponding bits being turned full on.  All
primaries off yields black, while all nearly full on gives white.
Yellow, cyan, and magenta can be created by pairing two of the other
primaries at full intensity.  The various shades of blue shown above
are created by varying the intensity of each primary--sometimes in
unexpected ways.The bottom line here is that if you don't intimately know the physics
of color, the best you can do is to look up existing colors from the
color name database and experiment with them by varying one or more of
the primaries till you find a color you like.  Unless you need precise
colors, you are probably better off using color names.If you do specify a color using a hexadecimal value, try to
use the same value for several applications so that they will
share a color cell.ID="IX-1013-B-11"color specificationnew-style RGBID="IX-1013-B-12"RGBnew-style color specification
In R5, the recommended way to specify specific RGB values is:ID="SC-1013-B-7"RGB:<red>/<green>/<blue>Where red, green, and blue are each between
1 and 4 hexadecimal digits.  Different
primaries may be specified with different numbers of
digits.  If fewer than 4 digits are specified, they do not simply
represent the most significant bits of the value;
instead they represent a fraction of the maximum value.
So the single digit 0xA does not mean 0xA000, but
10/15ths of 0xFFFF, or 0xAAAA.This form is now understood by all the Xlib functions that
accept color strings.

depends on the amount of memory available for color specification.ID="IX-1013-B-15"displaydepthID="IX-1013-B-16"colordisplaying
A color display uses multiple bits per pixel (also
referred to as multiple planes or the depth of the display)
to select colors.  Programs that draw
in color use the value of these bits as a pointer to a lookup table
called a colormap, in which each entry (or colorcell)
ID="IX-1013-B-17"colormapaboutID="IX-1013-B-18"colorcellcolormap
contains the RGB values for a particular color.LINKEND="FN-1013-B-2"ID="FN-1013-B-2"There is a type of high-performance display
in which pixel values are used directly to control
the illumination of the red, green, and blue phosphors, but far more
commonly, the bits per pixel are used indirectly, with the actual
color values specified independently, as described here.
As shown in
LINKEND="FG-1013-B-1"Figure B-1, any given pixel value is used as an index into
this table--for example, a pixel
value of 16 will select the sixteenth colorcell.This implementation explains several
issues that you might encounter in working with color
displays.First, the range of colors possible on the display is a function of
the number of bits available in the colormap for RGB specification.
If 8 bits are available for each primary, then the range of
possible colors is
256 3 
(somewhere over 16 million colors).  This means that you can create
incredibly precise differences between colors.However, the number of different colors that can be displayed
on the screen at any one time is a function of the number of
planes.  A four-plane system can index
2 4 colorcells (16 distinct colors); an eight-plane system can index
2 8 
colorcells (256 distinct colors); and a 24-plane system can index
2 24 
colorcells (over 16 million distinct colors).If you are using a four-plane workstation, the fact that you can
precisely define hundreds of different shades of blue is far less
significant than the fact that you can't use them all at the same
time.  There isn't space for all of them to be stored in the
colormap at one time.ID="FG-1013-B-1"Multiple planes used to index a colormapFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="b.01.gif" ID="GC-1013-B-1"This limitation is made more significant by the fact that X is a
multiclient environment.  When X starts up,
usually no colors are loaded into the colormap.  As clients are
invoked, certain of these cells are allocated.  But when all of the
free colorcells are used up, it is no
longer possible to request new colors.
When this happens, you will usually be given the closest possible
color from those that
have already been allocated.  However, you may instead be given
an error message and told that there are no free colorcells.In order to minimize the chance of running out of
ID="IX-1013-B-19"colorcellshared
colorcells, many programs use "shared" colorcells.
Shared colorcells can be used by any number of applications, but they
can't be changed by any of them.  They can be deallocated only by each
application that uses them, and when all applications have
deallocated the cell, it is available for setting again.  Shared
cells are most often used for background, border, and cursor colors.Alternately, some clients have to be able to change the color of
graphics they have already drawn.  This requires another kind of cell,
called private, which can't be shared.  A typical use of a private
cell would be for the palette of a color mixing application.  Such a
program might have three bars of each primary color, and a box which
shows the mixed color.  The primary bars would use shared cells, while
the mixed color box would use a private cell.In summary, some programs define colorcells to be
read-only and shareable, while others define colorcells to be
read/write and private.
ID="IX-1013-B-20"colorcellread-onlyID="IX-1013-B-21"colorcellread/writeTo top it off, there are even clients that may
create a whole private colormap of their own, which will be swapped
in by the window manager.
Because of the way color is implemented, if this happens, all other
applications will be displayed in unexpected colors.In order to minimize such conflicts, you should request
precise colors only when necessary.  By preference, use
color names or hexadecimal specifications that you specified for other
applications.For more information on color, see Chapter 7, Color, in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.ID="S1-1013-B-2"Font SpecificationID="IX-1013-B-22"screenfontsfontsID="IX-1013-B-23"printer fontsfontsID="IX-1013-B-24"fontsscreenID="IX-1013-B-25"fontsdisplay (xfd)ID="IX-1013-B-26"fontsprinterMost widgets that display text allow you to specify the font

These three directories (in this order) comprise X's default font path.
The font path can be changed with the fp option to the
xset client, as described in Volume Three,X Window System User's Guide, Motif Edition.  
(The font path, together with a great deal of
other information about the server defaults, can be listed with
xset query.)  The font path may include font servers, which
supply fonts over the network.
All fonts in the font path can be listed with
xlsfonts and fslsfonts, and the characters in a font can
be displayed on the screen with xfd.The names of each font file in the font directories has a
filename extension of .snf, which stands for server
natural format.  Fonts are distributed in
binary distribution format (bdf) in Release 4,
and need to be compiled for a given server.  Fonts are distributed
in portable compiled format (pcf) in Release 5, and do
not need compiling.ID="S2-1013-B-3"Font Naming ConventionsID="IX-1013-B-30"fontsnaming conventionID="IX-1013-B-31"conventionsfont namingIf you do a listing of any of the current font directories, you'll

names are defined by the X Logical Font Description convention, also
known as XLFD.  The complete XLFD is reprinted in Volume Zero,X Protocol Reference Manual.
Upon closer examination and XLFD name contains a great deal of
useful information:ID="FG-1013-B-2"A font nameFORMAT="EPS" FILEREF="b.02.gif" ID="GC-1013-B-3"This rather verbose line is actually the name of the font stored in the
file courBO10 (in the 75dpi directory).
This font name specifies the foundry (Adobe),
the font family (Courier), weight (bold),
slant (Oblique), set width (normal),
size of the font in pixels (10), size of the font in tenths of a point
(100--measured in tenths
of a point, thus equals 10 points), horizontal resolution (75dpi),
vertical resolution (75dpi), spacing (m, for monospace), average width
in tenths of a pixel
(60--measured in tenths of a pixel, thus equals 6 pixels)
and character set (iso8859-1).The meaning of many of these statistics is obvious.
Some of the less obvious information is explained below.FoundryThe type foundry (in this case, Adobe) that digitized and supplied the font.Set widthA value describing a font's proportionate width, according to the
foundry.  Typical set widths include:  normal, condensed, narrow,
double width.  All of the newer fonts have the set width normal.Pixels and pointsType is normally measured in points, a printer's unit equal to 1/72 of
an inch.
The size of a font in pixels depends on the resolution of
the display font in pixels.
For example, if the display font has 100 dots per inch (dpi) resolution,
a 12 point font will have a pixel size of 17, while with 75 dpi
resolution, a 12 point font will have a pixel size of 12.SpacingEither m (monospace, i.e.,
fixed-width) or p (proportional, i.e., variable-width).Horizontal and vertical resolutionThe resolution in dots per inch that a font is designed for.  Horizontal and vertical
figures are required because a screen may have different capacities for
horizontal and vertical resolution.Average widthMean width of all characters in the font, measured in tenths of a
pixel, in this case 6 pixels.Character setISO, the International Standards Organization, has defined character
set standards for various languages.
The iso8859-1 in
LINKEND="FG-1013-B-2"Figure B-2 represents the ISO Latin 1 character
set, which is used
by all of the fonts in the 75dpi and 100dpi directories.
The ISO Latin 1 character set is a superset of the standard ASCII
character set, which includes various special characters used in
European languages other than English.  See Appendix H of Volume Two,Xlib Reference Manual, for a complete listing of the characters in the ISO Latin 1 character set.This font-naming convention is intended to allow for the unique
naming of fonts of any style, resolution and size.
It is powerful, but unwieldy.To create a label widget that displays text in the
font stored in the file courBO10, you could use the resource
setting:ID="SC-1013-B-8"*label:  -adobe-courier-bold-o-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1Developers can specify default fonts using a complete font name.
However, requiring users to type a font name of this length is neither
desirable nor practical.  The X Window System developers have provided
two alternatives: wildcarding and aliasing.ID="S2-1013-B-4"Font Name WildcardingID="IX-1013-B-32"fontswildcardingID="IX-1013-B-33"wildcardsin font namesAny unnecessary part of a font name can be "wildcarded" by
specifying a question mark (?) for any single character and
an asterisk (*) for any group of characters.For example, using a wildcarded font name, the resource
specification above
could be written:ID="SC-1013-B-9"*label:  *courier-bold-o-*-100*(Note that when using wildcards with the -fn command line
option, you must take care to quote the font names,
since the UNIX shell has special meanings for the wildcard characters
* and ?.  This can be done by
enclosing the entire font name in quotes,
or by escaping each wildcard character by typing a backslash before it.)If more than one font in a given directory matches a wildcarded font name,
the server chooses the font to use.  If fonts from more than one
directory match the wildcarded name, the server will always choose
a font from the directory that is earlier in the font path.
Thus, if a wildcarded font name matches a font from both
the 75dpi and 100dpi directories, and the 75dpi
directory comes first in the font path, the server chooses the font
from that directory.In creating a wildcarded font name, you need to decide which parts of the
standard font name must be explicit and which parts can be replaced
with wildcards.  As the previous example illustrates,
you can use a single wildcard character for
multiple parts of the font name.  For instance, the final asterisk in
the example stands for the sequence:ID="SC-1013-B-10"-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1in the explicit font name.  The idea is to specify
enough parts of the font name explicitly so that the server gives you
the font you have in mind.It's helpful to familiarize yourself with
the available font families, weights, slants, and point sizes.
The following list gives these statistics for the fonts in the
directories 75dpi and 100dpi in the standard X
distribution from MIT.LINKEND="FN-1013-B-4"(The fonts in the misc
directory are holdovers from Release 2 and have short, manageable
names that should not require wildcarding.)

of a point (the 100 in the previous example, equal to 10 points), than
the pixel field (the 10).  This allows your wildcarded font name to
work properly with monitors of different resolutions.
For example, say
you use the following name to specify a 24 point (size), medium
(weight), Italic (slant) Charter (family) font:ID="SC-1013-B-11"*charter-medium-i-*-240-*This will match either of the following two font names

-bitstream-charter-medium-i-normal--33-240-100-100-p-136-iso8859-1depending on which directory comes first in your font path.
Specifying font size explicitly in pixels (25 for the first or 33 for the
second) rather than in points would limit
you to matching only one of these fonts.Given the complexity of font names and the rules of precedence used by
the server, you should use wildcards carefully.ID="S2-1013-B-5"Font Name AliasingID="IX-1013-B-36"fontsaliasingID="IX-1013-B-37" SPAN="START"aliasing font namesID="IX-1013-B-38"fontsaliasingAnother way to abbreviate font names is by aliasing--that is, by
associating them with alternative names.  You can create a
file (or files) called fonts.alias, in any directory in the font
search path, to set aliases for the fonts in that directory.
The X server uses both fonts.dir files (see LINKEND="S2-1013-B-7"Section B.2.5, "The fonts.dir Files") and
fonts.alias files to locate fonts in the font path.Be aware that when you create or edit a fonts.alias file,
the server does not automatically recognize the aliases in question.
You must make the server aware of newly created or edited alias files
by resetting the font path with xset.The fonts.alias file has a two-column format similar to the
fonts.dir file (described in a moment):  the first column
contains aliases,
the second contains the actual font names.
If you want to specify an alias that contains spaces, enclose the
alias in double quotes.  If you want to include double quotes or other
special characters as part of an alias, precede each special symbol
with a backslash.When you use an alias to specify a font in a command line,
the server searches for the font associated with that alias
in every directory in the font path.  Therefore, a fonts.alias file
in one directory can set aliases for fonts in other directories as well.
You might choose to create a single
alias file in one directory of the font path to set aliases for
the most commonly used fonts in all the directories.

this sample file contains aliases for three fonts (of different point
sizes) that are easily readable in xterm windows.You can also use wildcards within the font names in the right hand column
of an alias file.  For instance, the alias file above might also be written:ID="SC-1013-B-13"xterm12    *courier-medium-r-*-120*
xterm14    *courier-medium-r-*-140*

font name being equivalent to the name of the file in which it is
stored, without the .snf extension), there is a way to emulate this
convention using alias files.  In each directory in the
font path, create a fonts.alias file containing only the
following line:
ID="IX-1013-B-39"fontsusing filename as aliasID="IX-1013-B-40"aliasing font namesID="SC-1013-B-16"FILE_NAMES_ALIASESEach filename (without the .snf extension) will then serve as an
alias for the font the file contains.  Note that an alias file
containing this line applies only to the directory in which it is
found.  To make every font name equivalent to the name of the file in
which it is stored, you need to create a fonts.alias file such
as this in every font directory.If you've specified FILE_NAMES_ALIASES in an alias file,
you can choose the fonts in that directory by means of their
filenames, as we did in the resource example at the end of
Chapter 2, Introduction to the X Toolkit and Motif.ID="S2-1013-B-6"Making the Server Aware of AliasesAfter you create (or update) an alias file, the server does not

You must make the server aware of newly created or edited alias files

The xset option fp (font path) with
the rehash argument causes
the server to reread the fonts.dir and fonts.alias files in the

from several vendors,
you may have encountered frustrating problems with
the use of fonts.  If fonts have different names on one
host than they do on another,
an application that performs normally on one display
will abort with a "Can't load font" error on another.
Or you may have had to maintain separate defaults files
for use on different displays.ID="IX-1013-B-47"networked font servicefont serviceIdeally, the site administrator could simply place
fonts in a directory of a networked file system that is accessible to
all hosts at the site.  Unfortunately, no
binary format for font data has been standardized, and
the X servers supplied by different vendors
expect data in mutually incompatible formats.  If a
vendor wishes to support several font formats, the
server must include code to parse each one.R5 provides an elegant solution to these problems in
the form of a networked font service.  Under this
new model, an X server can obtain font data in a simple
bitmap format from a font server process running
somewhere on the network.  The font server does the
work of parsing font files for any supported format and
exports font data in a bitmap format standardized by
the X Font Service Protocol (reprinted in Volume Zero,X Protocol Reference Manual as of late 1992).  
ID="IX-1013-B-48"font serviceprotocolID="IX-1013-B-49"X Font Service Protocol
X servers that take advantage of font service no longer need to
do the work of parsing fonts themselves.  In the near
future, however, it is likely that workstation-based X servers
and X terminals will continue to
support file-based fonts along with their support for
font servers.The Font Service Protocol was designed by Jim Fulton of
Network Computing Devices.  The font server in the MIT
distribution was implemented primarily by Dave Lemke,
ID="IX-1013-B-50"Apple Computerfont servers
also of NCD.  In addition, Apple Computer has donated a
font server (which runs only on the Apple Macintosh
computer) to export the Apple bitmap fonts, and, if
available, the Apple TrueType fonts as well.Typically, a font server will run on one host per site
ID="IX-1013-B-51"font serviceconfigurationID="IX-1013-B-52"font servicearchitecture
and will export all the fonts available at the site,
but there are a variety of other ways that font service can
be configured.  A large site may choose to have
multiple font servers to prevent overloading of a single server
or to protect against service outages
caused by network trouble or server crashes.
A font server could export fonts parsed
from a variety of formats, or a separate server could
be used for each format.  A vendor of fonts with a
custom format might provide a special font server to
export those fonts, and might use the special server to
implement licensing policies--restricting the maximum
ID="IX-1013-B-53"font serviceused for licensing
number of simultaneous users of a font, for example.
Finally, note that in the terminology of X font
service, the X server is a font client, and that

Note that R5 defines a new abstraction, the XFontSet,
which is used in internationalized applications, but that
this has nothing whatsoever to do with font service.ID="S1-1013-B-4"Scalable FontsAnother new feature in R5 is font scaling.  In
ID="IX-1013-B-70"font servicescalingID="IX-1013-B-71"font scalingID="IX-1013-B-72"scalable~fonts
previous releases, each font was available only in a
limited number of standard point sizes and resolutions.
In the MIT distribution of R5, both the X server and
the font server implement a simple bitmap font-scaling
algorithm that allows fonts to be obtained at any
desired point size and resolution.  Bitmap fonts are
easily scalable, but the resulting scaled font is
generally jagged and difficult to read.  Fortunately,
R5 also provides a set of outline fonts.  Outline
fonts scale nicely, but the scaling process requires
significant computation, so an X server
might freeze for several seconds while scaling a large Asian font.
This is one of the
problems that font servers are intended to address.
The fonts and the scaling code
were donated by Bitstream, Inc.Until Release 5, X relied exclusively on non-scalable
bitmap fonts.  If there was no installed font in the
ID="IX-1013-B-73"bitmapfontsID="IX-1013-B-74"fontsbitmap
point size and resolution you wanted, then you were out
of luck--it is obviously not feasible to provide every
font in every point size and for every possible
resolution.  Bitmap fonts do not scale well, because
their pixel-by-pixel specification can only be made
smaller by omitting pixels or made larger by making
pixels bigger, resulting in a jagged, low-resolution
font.  The fonts shipped by MIT for Release 5 include
several "outline fonts" which describe characters by
their component curves rather than by individual
pixels.  This description allows for successful scaling
to any desired point size and resolution.  The font
ID="IX-1013-B-75"scaling~fonts
server shipped by MIT in Release 5 has the capability
to read and scale these outline fonts, and therefore
the number of fonts available to the user is greatly
increased.  (Note, however, that a good bitmap font that is
ID="IX-1013-B-76"hand-tuned~fonts
"hand-tuned" to a particular point size and screen
resolution will generally be better looking than an
outline font scaled to that size and resolution.  Font
design is an art, and the human touch is still
important.)The
following two sections apply equally
to all scalable and scaled fonts, whether outline or
bitmap, from the X server or the font server.ID="S2-1013-B-8"Finding Scalable FontsID="IX-1013-B-77"scalable fontsfindingSupporting scalable fonts raises some important

ID="IX-1013-B-78"XListFontsand scalable fonts
(theoretically) an infinite number of point sizes and
resolutions that a font could be scaled to, it is no
longer possible to list all available fonts in
all available sizes.  So some special syntax is
needed to indicate that a font is scalable and is
available in any desired size, even if that size is
not listed.  But backwards compatibility is also an
issue--the new point sizes provided by scalable fonts
should not be hidden from existing pre-R5
applications.These seemingly contradictory goals are resolved by
changing the semantics of the call to XListFonts()ID="IX-1013-B-79"XListFontsnew semantics

present in the name.  For example,ID="SC-1013-B-18" *-helvetica-bold-o-*-*-*-120-*is not a well-formed name, butID="SC-1013-B-19" -*-helvetica-bold-o-*-*-*-120-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1ID="IX-1013-B-91"font nameswell-formedis well-formed.  Shortcut names specified as in the first example
have come into common use, but with the increasing
variety of display resolutions and fonts with
non-standard charsets, it is good practice to specify
these extra fields, even if you are not interested in
using scaled fonts.  If XListFonts() is passed a
pattern that is not well-formed, it may not include
scalable fonts in the search at all.To list scalable fonts, call XListFonts() with
a well-formed pattern with "0" or "*" in its
PIXEL_SIZE, POINT_SIZE, and AVERAGE_WIDTH fields.
LINKEND="EX-1013-B-3"Example B-3 shows some queries that will return

and average width) of zero is not very useful by
itself.  If you call XLoadFont() on this font
name without a size (or specify such a font name for a font
resource), you will get some implementation-defined default
size.  Instead of listing scalable
Helvetica fonts, for example, you will more often want
to list all Helvetica fonts at some particular point
size.  The list you get may contain non-scaled bitmap
fonts as well as derived instances of scalable fonts.
In order to include derived instances of scalable fonts
in a search, it is necessary to specify some of the
size fields explicitly.  There are five scalable
fields in an XLFD font name:

AVERAGE_WIDTH (fields 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.)  In order
for XListFonts() to list a particular scaled size
of a scalable font,
enough of these scalable fields must be specified so that the
font name pattern matches exactly one
derived instance of the font.
ID="IX-1013-B-106"derived instancesID="IX-1013-B-107"scalable fontsderived instancesID="IX-1013-B-108"derived instancesof scalable fonts
If too few of the scalable fields are specified, there
will be no unique match, and if too many are specified,
there may not be any possible scaling that meets all of
those specified criteria.When searching for fonts at a particular size, you will
typically wildcard the pixel size and average width by
setting those fields to "*" and explicitly specify the
point size you want along with the x- and y-resolutions
of your screen.  (You can calculate screen resolutions
with macros like DisplayWidth and
DisplayWidthMM, as shown in a later example.)
These three fields specify all that is needed to
correctly scale the font.  You need not (and should
not) specify the pixel size, because the point size and
y-resolution of the screen determine the desired
pixel size.  You need not specify the average width
because the point size and x-resolution of the
screen, together with the height to width ratio
implicit to the font, determine the desired width.  It
is also possible to name a single derived instance of a
scalable font by specifying a pixel size plus x- and y-resolutions.  There are also other combinations of
fields that will work, but none are particularly useful
in practice.

                  50, &count);There are a number of reasons that a font name pattern
could fail to match derived instances of scalable
fonts.  It is difficult to devise an algorithm that will
correctly match scalable fonts against any font name
pattern.  For this reason, the X server or font server
is not required to include scalable fonts in its search
if the pattern it is given is not well-formed.  A
well-formed pattern must contain 14 hyphens.  Note in
particular that the first character in a well-formed
name must be a hyphen.An underspecified font name
ID="IX-1013-B-109"scalable fontsunderspecified namesID="IX-1013-B-110"font namesunderspecifiedID="IX-1013-B-111"underspecified font names
will not match any derived instances of
scalable fonts.  This is because your
font name could match any number of derived instances,
and it is not possible to list them all.
When only the point size and pixel size are specified, for
example, they are enough together to determine the
desired y-resolution for the font, but any x-resolution
(and therefore any average width)
is still possible.  To uniquely match a derived instance, you'd
have to specify the x-resolution of your screen or a
desired average width for the font.
The MIT implementation, however, makes reasonable
guesses for unspecified resolution values, so
underspecified font names do not occur.  If only point
size is specified, then default resolutions (75 or
100 dpi) are used.  If both point and pixel size are
specified as above, then the y-resolution they specify
is used for both x- and y-resolution fields.Similarly, an

overspecified font name, one with point size, pixel
size, and x- and y-resolutions, for example,
may not match any derived instances of
scalable fonts:  if the specified  y-resolution
is different from the y-resolution implicitly defined by the combination of
point size and pixel size, then there is no way that
the font can be scaled to satisfy your request.

ID="FN-1013-C-1"This appendix is based on a comp.windows.x network news posting
by Gene Dykes of Cornell University.MARK="BULLET"It will be much easier for programmers to move from toolkit to
toolkit without needing to constantly refer to manuals to figure out
how to properly name various items.It will be easier to mix widgets from different widgets sets in one
application.It will make it possible for automatic code
generators to work with lots
of widgets without making special modifications for any toolkit.These conventions are common between the OPEN LOOK and Motif
widget sets with a few minor differences.  However, the Athena widget
set currently does not follow the conventions described.It is important to note that these suggestions are
in no way blessed (or damned) by the X Consortium--they are simply a
guideline that we suggest you follow in the interests of promoting
the benefits listed above.  We will use Motif as an example.A toolkit uses a special prefix with all its widgets.  In the case of
Motif, this prefix is m.  Using that prefix and a hypothetical Label
widget as an example, the conventions are as follows:Toolkit library namelibXm.aWidget class nameXmLabelInclude directives<Xm/Label.h>class_name field in the core structureLabelEnumerated resource valuesXmCAPITALIZED_WORDSPublic function namesXmLabelFunctionName()Truncated include file namesStrip the lowercase letters a word at a time until the basename
is nine characters or fewer (but strip as few letters as possible
from the initial word).  Thus:<Xm/VeryLongWidgetName.h>becomes:<Xm/VeryLWN.h>but:<Xm/Verylongwidgetname.h>becomes:<Xm/Verylongw.h>(Note difference in VeryLong (two words) and Verylong
(one word).)Macro names for preprocessor in include files#ifndef XM_LABEL_HThis is to prevent header files from being included more than once.

to the widget name, so XmLabelGadget is the gadget class name.Widget class pointerxmLabelWidgetClassGadget class pointerxmLabelGadgetClassCreate function for widgets or gadgetsWidget XmCreateLabel (parent, name,
 arglist, argcount)This is a shortcut to using XtCreateWidget().  However, in the
case of top-level widgets (menus, dialogs, MainWindow), it
also creates the shell widget and creates the requested
widget within it.The special Create functions can also be used as convenience
routines for specialized widget instances.  For example,
XmCreateWorkingDialog() and XmCreateWarningDialog() actually
create a MessageBox whose XmDialogType resources are
respectively XmDIALOG_WARNING and XmDIALOG_WORKING.OPEN LOOK uses conventions similar to Motif, but leaves the prefixes
off the widget class name.  We recommend that you supply a prefix for
any widgets you write, especially if there is any chance that some
other widget set may use the same class name.  In other words, if we
wrote a new Label widget, we might call it OraLabel, not just Label,

Prior to X11R5, the Xt string constants (the
XtN, XtC, and XtR names) were
macros for constant strings.  With many compilers, each
occurrence of a constant string is compiled into the
object file, even when there are multiple instances of
the same string.  In the X11R5 MIT implementation of Xt,
these macros have been changed to pointers into a
single large array of characters (with embedded null
characters dividing the array into individual strings).
Under this new scheme, all of the Xt strings are
embedded in every application once, but none more than once.  
For many applications this will result in an overall memory savings.ID="IX-1013-D-13"X11/Intrinsic.hID="IX-1013-D-14"X11/Xos.h
Prior to X11R5, the MIT implementation of
<X11/Intrinsic.h> included the file
<X11/Xos.h>.  This inclusion was a violation of the specification,
and the file is no longer included.
<X11/Xos.h> defines System V and BSD-style
string indexing functions (index and
strchr), includes the appropriate
time-handling header file, and hides other, more
obscure, operating system dependencies.  The most
likely problem to result from this change in
<X11/Intrinsic.h> is that programs that
unknowingly relied on macro definitions of index
or strchr from <X11/Xos.h> will now fail
to compile.

These programs may be compiled with the -DXT_BC
flag which will restore the pre-X11R5 behavior.
Substantial effort has been put into the MIT X11R5
implementation to make it comply with ANSI-C and POSIX
standards.  New standard header files have been defined
that make it easier to write portable X applications.
They are <X11/Xfuncs.h>, <X11/Xfuncproto.h>, and

changes to the XmText widget.  In 1.2 the text widget has
changed significantly enough that any subclasses may need to
be re-written.MARK="BULLET"XmTextDisableRedisplay() and XmTextEnableRedisplay() 
are public; use them when making batched updates.XmTextFindString() searches for a string within
the text widget.XmTextGetSubstring() get just a portion of the
text value.  This can save memory for large text widgets
because the entire value does not need to be duplicated.There is now an overstrike mode, and an action
procedure toggle-overstrike() to toggle between
insert and overstrike modes.The annoying caret-cursor ("destination cursor") has been dropped.There is a new internal data structure, which makes
scrolling of long files much faster.XmTextField.  The 1.2 XmTextField widget has a substring function,
XmTextFieldGetSubstring(), and no longer has a
destination cursor.XmList.  The XmList widget now has items that are selectable with
drag-and-drop.  There are a number of new convenience
routines for adding, removing, and replacing items, as well
as setting and querying the position of the keyboard
traversal cursor, etc.XmMessageBox and XmSelectionBox.  The XmMessageBox and XmSelectionBox widgets now allow the
programmer to add a menubar and additional button children.
There is a new convenience dialog creation routine,
XmCreateTemplateDialog() which creates an
XmMessageBox containing only a separator gadget.  The
XmSelectionBox widget now uses an XmTextField widget rather
than an XmText widget.XmScrollBar.  There is now an action procedure that cancels a drag in
progress.XmScrolledWindow.  There is a new callback list invoked when the user attempts
to traverse to a widget that is not currently visible.
There is a new function, XmScrollVisible() which
will adjust the XmScrolledWindow to make one of its widget
children visible.XmFrame.  The XmFrame widget now supports an additional child (usually
a label) to serve as the "title" for the frame.XmRowColumn.  The XmRowColumn widget supports a new resource
XmNverticalAlignment which controls the vertical
alignment of its children.VendorShell.  The Motif VendorShell widget now has resources to control
input methods and provides geometry management for input
method preedit and status areas, when needed.  It also
supports a new resource XmNaudibleWarning which
controls whether a beep should accompany warning messages.
Text widgets determine the default value of their
XmNverifyBell resource from this VendorShell resource.ID="S2-1013-D-2"New Display and Screen ObjectsMotif 1.2 now automatically creates an XmDisplay object to
hold display-specific data and XmScreen object to hold
screen-specific data.  These objects may be obtained for a
specific display or screen with the functions
XmGetXmDisplay() and XmGetXmScreen().  The
XmScreen object has resources such as
XmNlightThreshold and XmNdarkThreshold which
control the automatic selection of colors, and resources
such as XmNdefaultSourceCursorIcon which control
default drag-and-drop visuals.ID="S2-1013-D-3"Default ColorsThe XmScreen object now has resources that allow fine
control over the procedures that automatically generate
shadow colors and a contrasting foreground color based on
the background color.  A new function
XmChangeColor() changes all the colors for a
specified widget.  There is a new interface to the pixmap
cache: XmGetPixmapByDepth() which allows pixmaps to
be obtained for Visuals of other than the default depth.ID="S2-1013-D-4"Insensitive VisualsThe XmList, XmText, XmTextField, XmScrollBar, and
XmArrowButton widgets now provide visual feedback when they
have been made insensitive.ID="S2-1013-D-5"Baseline AlignmentTwo new functions XmWidgetGetBaselines() and
XmWidgetGetDisplayRect() allow precise alignment of
text within widgets of different classes or with different
margins.ID="S2-1013-D-6"Geometry ManagementGeometry management code has been overhauled in Motif 1.2.
This should result in more uniform interactions between
primitive and manager widgets.ID="S2-1013-D-7"TraversalMotif 1.2 provides better support for programmers who need
to explicitly manage traversal.  There are five new public
functions: XmGetFocusWidget(),
XmGetTabGroup(), XmIsTraversable(),
XmIsVisible(), and XmGetVisibility().In addition, the XmManager widget has a new resource,
XmNinitialFocus which specifies which child will be
the first to receive keyboard focus.  This is independent of
the XmBulletinBoard resource XmNdefaultButton.XmTrackingLocate() has been improved to handle
keyboard events as well as mouse button events.ID="S2-1013-D-8"Representation Type Convenience FunctionsMotif 1.2 supports XmRepTypeRegister() and a series
of other XmRepType*() functions that allow the
simple registration of resource converters for enumerated
types.  With these functions it is no longer necessary to
write a resource converter procedure for every enumerated
type.ID="S2-1013-D-9"caddr_t Changed to XtPointerAll references to the type caddr_t have been changed
to XtPointer because caddr_t is not part of
the ANSI-C standard.ID="S2-1013-D-10"MwmIn Motif 1.2, mwm supports the non-rectangular window SHAPE
extension, supports opaque moves of windows, has the concept
of window "families" with their own internal stacking order,
and allows the user to specify the location of the feedback
window.  There are a number of other minor changes.ID="S2-1013-D-11"UIL and MrmIn Motif 1.2, the UIL compiler has been internationalized.
Invoking it with the "-s" option will cause it to call
setlocale() and run in the current locale.  There
are new primitives that allow the creation of wide character
strings and font sets from UIL.  The Mrm library contains a
new function MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay() which
supports different UID file search paths for each display.ID="AX-1013-E-1" NUMBER="E"The xbitmap ApplicationAppendix E: The xbitmap ApplicationThis appendix shows the complete code for the BitmapEdit widget
and a relatively complex version of xbitmap, which is described
in LINKEND="CH-1013-4-1""Chapter 4, An Example Application."ID="IX-1013-E-1"xbitmap applicationThis appendix shows the complete code for the BitmapEdit
widget (without selections), and for an advanced
version of the xbitmap application (xbitmap5 in the
example distribution) which is similar to 
xbitmap3 described in Chapter 4 except that it both reads and
writes X11 bitmap files (xbitmap3 was capable of writing them
only).All source code from this book is available free from numerous sources,

}ID="AX-1013-F-1" NUMBER="F"Sources of Additional InformationAppendix F: Sources of Additional InformationID="IX-1013-F-1"Xsource softwareThis appendix describes where you can get more information about Xlib
and about X in general, including other books on the subject and the
various ways to get the source code for X.This appendix lists a few of the official and unofficial sources for
information about the X Window System and associated software.Note that some of this detailed information may become dated rather quickly.
The best source of current information is the comp.windows.x network
news group, described later in this appendix.ID="S1-1013-F-1"Getting the X SoftwareAt this writing, the current public release level is Release 5.  This book
documents Release 4 and Release 5.  Many people will continue to use
R4 for a while, since there is a considerable lag time between the
date that MIT distributes a new release and the date by which vendors
integrate that release into their
own products and issue updates.  All changes to Xlib in R5 are backwards
compatible, although there are many new interfaces that provide
additional capabilities.You can get the X software directly from MIT on three 9-track 1600-BPI
magtapes written in UNIX tar format or on one 9-track 6250-BPI
magtape, along with printed copies of MIT's manuals, by sending a check
in U.S. currency for U.S. $400 to:MIT Software Distribution CenterTechnology Licensing OfficeMIT E32-30077 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA  02139Their telephone number is (617) 253-6966, and the "X Ordering Hotline"is (617) 258-8330.  If you want the tapes and manuals shipped overseas,
the price is $500.  The manual set alone is $125, including U.S. shipping,
or $175, including overseas shipping.Other distribution media or formats are not available from the MIT
Software Distribution Center but are from other independent vendors
such as ICS, mentioned later.  The Release tape comes with source code
for sample servers for Apollo, DEC, HP, IBM, Sony, Sun, and several other
workstations, source code for clients written by MIT, sources for the
toolkits Xt, XView, Interviews, and Andrew, contributed software
written outside MIT, and sources and Postscript files for all MIT's
documentation.  Note that the servers supplied are sample servers only;
commercial vendors typically release optimized (faster) servers for the
same machines.Sites that have access to the Internet can retrieve the distribution from
the following machines using anonymous ftp.  Here are the current sites:

DO NOT do anonymous ftp during normal business hours, and

Internet access.  The files are split up to be small enough for UUCP
distribution.ID="S2-1013-F-1"Bug FixesCritical bug fixes as well as a limited number of important new features
are available from the archive server xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu.
Electronic mail sent to this address is forwarded to a program which
responds with the requested information.  The rest of this section and
the two sections that follow it explain how to use xstuff.ID="IX-1013-F-2" SPAN="START"xstuff serverThe xstuff server is a mail-response program.  This means that you
mail it a request and it mails back the response.The xstuff server is a very dumb program.  It does not have much
error checking.  If you do not send it commands that it understands, it
will just answer "I don't understand you."The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything,
so you can have several different commands in a single message.  It treats
the "Subject:" header line just like any other line of the message.  You
can use any combination of upper and lowercase letters in the commands.The archives are organized into a series of directories and
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory
has an index.  The top-level index gives you an overview of what is
in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you
what it contains.If you are bored with reading documentation and just want to try
something, then send the server a message containing the line:ID="SC-1013-F-1"send index fixesWhen you get the index back, it will contain the numbers of all of
the fixes and batches of fixes in the archive.  Then you can send the
server another message asking it to send you the fixes that you want:ID="SC-1013-F-2"send fixes 1 5 9 11-20If you are using a mailer that understands "@" notation, send to
xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu.  If your mailer deals in "!" notation,
try sending to {someplace}!eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.
For other mailers, you're on your own.The server has four commands.  Each command must be the first word on a line.helpThe command help or send help causes the server to send
you the help file.  No other commands are honored in a message that
asks for help (the server figures that you had better read the help
message before you do anything else).indexIf your message contains a line whose first word is index, then
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the
archive.  If there are other words on that line that match the names
of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent
instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say:ID="SC-1013-F-3"indexor:ID="SC-1013-F-4"index fixesYou can then send back another message to the xstuff server,
using a send command (see below) to ask it to send you the
files whose names you learned from that list.index fixes and send index fixes mean the same thing:  you
can use send instead of index for getting an index.If your message has an index or a send index command, then
all other send commands will be ignored.  This means that you cannot
get an index and data in the same request.  This is so that index requests
can be given high priority.sendIf your message contains a line whose first word is send, then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the
line.  To name an item, you give its directory and its name.  For example:ID="SC-1013-F-5"send fixes 1-10Once you have named a category, you can put as many names as you like
on the rest of the line.  They will all be taken from that category.
For example:ID="SC-1013-F-6"send fixes 1-10 11-20 21-30Each send command can reference only one directory.  If you
would like to get one fix and one of something else, you must use
two send commands.You may put as many send commands as you like into one message
to the server, but the more you ask for, the longer it will take to
receive.  See LINKEND="S3-1013-F-2"Section F.1.1.2, "Fairness" for an explanation.  Actually,
it is not strictly true that you can put as many send commands
as you want into one message.  If the server must use UUCP mail to send
your files, then it cannot send more than 100K bytes in one message.
If you ask for more than it can send, then it will send as much as it
can and ignore the rest.pathThe path command exists to help in case you do not get responses
from the server when you mail to it.Sometimes the server is unable to return mail over the incoming path.
There are dozens of reasons why this might happen, and if you are a
true wizard, you already know what those reasons are.  If you are an
apprentice wizard, you might not know all the reasons, but you might
know a way to circumvent them.If you put in a path command, then everything that the server
mails to you will be mailed to that address rather than to the return
address on your mail.  The server host expo.lcs.mit.edu does
not have a direct UUCP connection to anywhere; you must go through
mit-eddie (the UUCP name of eddie.mit.edu) or somewhere else.ID="S3-1013-F-1"NotesThe xstuff server acknowledges every request by return mail.
If you do not get a message back in a day or two, you should assume
that something is going wrong and perhaps try a path command.The xstuff server does not respond to requests from users named
root, system, daemon, or mailer.  This is to
prevent mail loops.  If your name is "Bruce Root" or "Jane Daemon"and you can document this, we will happily rewrite the server to remove
this restriction.  Yes, we know about Norman Mailer and Waverley Root.
Norman doesn't use netmail and Waverley is dead.ID="S3-1013-F-2"FairnessThe xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not
monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data.  The mailer is set
up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day.  If
the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent
files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is
run to send its day's quota, it sends the shortest requests out first.If you have a request waiting in the work queue and you send in another
request, the new request is added to the old one (thereby increasing its
size) rather than being filed anew.  This prevents you from being able to
send in a large number of small requests as a way of beating the system.The reason for all of these quotas and limitations is that the delivery
resources are finite, and there are many people who would like to make
use of the archive.

Most of these companies are preparing products based on X.  It should
not be long before many different products are available that support X.ID="S1-1013-F-5"Finding Out for YourselfID="FN-1013-F-1"Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, BrazilID="IX-1013-F-11"serversguide to server codeX is unusual in that the source code is freely copyable by anyone as
long as the copyright notices are observed.  It should
be possible for most X programmers to get a copy of the X source code
from the sources listed above.  Once you understand how the code is
organized, you can look up certain details about how X works as long as
you have a good knowledge of C and a little persistence.  In "Star Wars,"the saying was "Use the Force, Luke."  In X, it is "Use the Source, Luke."Xlib and the server are two distinct chunks of code.  Each contains code
for sending and receiving information to and from the other over the
network using protocol requests, replies, events, and errors.  The source
tree as supplied on the X distribution tape places the Xlib source in the
directory base/lib/X, where base is the top of the entire
source tree.  Their server source is placed in base/server.The procedure for finding out something about an Xlib routine is
normally to search for the routine in the Xlib code and then figure
out what it does.  Sometimes the answer can be found there.  Many of
the routines, however, simply place their arguments in a protocol
request and send it to the server.  Then you will have to look in the
server code for the answer.  To find the correct place in the server
code, you will need the symbol for the protocol request, which is the
first argument in the GetReq call.The server code is much more involved than Xlib itself.  The
device-dependent portions are in base/server/ddx, and the
device-independent portions are in base/server/dix.  The
device-independent code should be your first stop, because it is here
that protocol requests from Xlib arrive and are dispatched to the
appropriate code.  Search for the protocol request symbol you found
in Xlib.  It will appear in several source files.  Start with the
occurrence in dispatch.c, and try to figure out what the code
does.  This will require following leads to other routines.If you do not find a routine in base/server/dix, then it must be
in the device-dependent code.  base/server/ddx has one directory
in it for each brand of hardware to which a sample server has been
ported.  It also contains the directories /cfb, /mfb,
/mi, and /snf, which contain routines used in writing the
sample server device-dependent code.  Note that servers may
include code ostensibly for other machines.  For example, the Sun sample server
appears to use code in several of the directories for other servers
such as dec and hp.Xlib and the X protocol are both defined by specification documents, not
by any particular implementation.  Never depend on the implementation
details of the Xlib or server code.  If you do, your code may not run on
a machine that has optimized X software.  This manual documents only those
features of Xlib and X in general that are governed by X Consortium standard
specifications.  If you follow the guidance you find in this volume and the
details in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual,  shape.ID="GL-1013-GLOSSARY-1"GlossaryGlossaryX uses many common terms in unique ways.  A good example is "chilldren."  While most, if not all, of these terms are defined where they are first used in this manual, you will undoubtedly find it easier to refresh your memory by looking for them here.This glossary is an expanded version of the glossary from Volume One,
Xlib Programming Manual (which in turn is based on the glossary in
the Xlib-C Language X Interface, by
Jim Gettys, Ron Newman, and Bob Scheifler). As such, it contains
definitions of many Xlib terms not actually used in this book, but
which you might come across in other reading, or in comments in code.
In some cases, these Xlib terms may be used in the definitions of the
Xt terms given in this glossary.  Any term used in a definition, for
which another entry exists in the glossary, is generally shown in
italics.acceleratorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-1"acceleratorsabout
An accelerator is a translation that maps events in one widget to actions in another.  The name is based on the most frequent use for this feature, namely to provide keyboard shortcuts to invoke application or widget functions that would otherwise have only a pointer-driven interface. accept_focus methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-2"methodsaccept_focus; about
The accept_focus method of a child is invoked when a parent offers the keyboard focus to a child by calling XtCallAcceptFocus().  This method is part of the Core widget class. access control listID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-3"access control list
X maintains lists of hosts that are allowed access to each server controlling a display.  By default, only the local host may use the display, plus any hosts specified in the access control list for that display.  This access control list can be changed by clients on the local host.  Some server implementations may implement other authorization mechanisms in addition to or instead of this one.  The list can currently be found in /etc/X#.hosts where # is the number of the display, usually 0 (zero). The access control list is also known as the host access list. actionID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-4"actionsabout
An action is a function bound by a translation, to be invoked in response to a user event. actions tableID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-5"actionsactions table; about
An actions table is an array of function pointers and corresponding strings by which actions can be referenced in a translation table.  The use of actions requires a widget to define both an actions table and a translation table. active grabID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-6"grabsabout
A grab is active when the pointer or keyboard is actually owned by a single grabbing client.  See also grab. ancestorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-7"ancestor
If window W is an inferior of window A, then A is an ancestor of W. The parent window, the parent's parent window, and so on are all ancestors of the given window. The rootwindow is the ancestor of all windows on a given screen. application contextID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-8"application contextsabout
An application context specifies a connection to a server.  When an application program has connections to multiple servers, the application context coordinates events and their dispatching, so all connections get processed. argument listID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-9"argumentsargument lists; about
An argument list is used in a call to create a widget in order to "hardcode" the value of widget resources, and also in calls to XtSetValues() or XtGetValues().  It consists of an array of Arg structures, each consisting of a resource name and the value to which it should be set. Athena widgetID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-10"Athena widgetsabout
MIT distributes a set of widgets developed by MIT's Project Athena in the AthenaWidget library, Xaw.  The include files for Athena widgets usually reside in /usr/include/X11/Xaw. atomID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-11"atomsabout
An atom is a unique numeric ID corresponding to a string name.  Atoms are used to identify properties, types, and selections in order to avoid the overhead of passing arbitrary-length strings over the network.  See also property. backgroundID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-12"backgroundabout
Windows may have a background, consisting of either a solid color or a tile pattern. If a window has a background, it will be repainted automatically by the server whenever there is an Expose event on the window. If a window does not have a background, it will be transparent.  By default, a window has a background.  See also foreground. backing storeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-13"backing_storeabout
When a server maintains the contents of a window, the off-screen saved pixels are known as a backing store.  This feature is not available on all servers.  Even when available, the server will not maintain a backing store, unless told to do so with a window attribute.  Use the DoesBackingStores Xlib macro to determine if this feature is supported. bit gravityID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-14"bitbit gravity window attribute
When a window is resized, the contents of the window are not necessarily discarded.  It is possible to request the server (though no guarantees are made) to relocate the previous contents to some region of the resized window.  This attraction of window contents for some location of a window is known as bit gravity.  For example, an application that draws a graph might request that the contents be moved into the lower-left corner, so that the origin of the graph will still appear in the lower-left corner.  See also window gravity. bit planeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-15"bitbit plane
On a color or gray scale display, each pixel has more than one bit defined. Data in display memory can be thought of either as pixels (multiple bits per pixel) or as bit planes (one bit plane for each usable bit in the pixel).  The bit plane is an array of bits the size of the screen. bitmapID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-16"bitmapabout
A bitmap is a pixmap with a depth of one bit.  There is no bitmap type in X11.  Instead, use a pixmap of depth 1.  See also pixmap. borderID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-17"borderabout
A window can have a border that is zero or more pixels wide. If a window has a border, the border can have a solid color or a tile pattern, and it will be repainted automatically by the server whenever its color or pattern is changed or an Expose event occurs on the window. button grabbingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-18"buttonsgrabbing
A pointer grab that becomes active only when a specified set of keys and/or buttons are held down in a particular window is referred to as a button grab. byte orderID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-19"byte order
The order in which bytes of data are stored in memory is hardware-dependent.  For pixmaps and bitmaps, byte order is defined by the server, and clients with different native byte ordering must swap bytes as necessary.  For all other parts of the protocol, the byte order is defined by the client, and the server swaps bytes as necessary. callbackID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-20"callbacksabout
A callback is an application function registered with a widget by the application using either of the calls XtAddCallback() or XtAddCallbacks() or through an argument list.  A widget declares one or more callback lists as resources; applications add functions to these lists in order to link widgets to applications code. change_managed methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-21"methodschange_managed; about
When a parent should change its managed widgets, the change_managed method is invoked, at which time a parent reorganizes its children. The change_managed method is part of the Composite widget class. child, children1) A widget created by XtCreateWidget() is a child of the widget specified as its parent.  The parent controls the layout of its children.2) The children of a window are its first-level subwindows.  All of these windows were created with the same window as parent. A client creates its top-level window as a child of the root window. classID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-22"classabout
1) (X Toolkit) A widget's class determines what methods will be called for it and what instance variables it has.  For widget users, a widget's class is declared in the .h file for the widget.2) (Xlib) There are two uses of the term class in X:  window class and visual class.  The window class specifies whether a window is InputOnly or InputOutput. The visual class specifies the color model that is used by a window. See the classes DirectColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor, StaticColor, StaticGray, and TrueColor. Both window class and visual class are set permanently when a window is created. class_initialize methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-23"methodsclass_initialize; about
This method--part of the Core widget--is invoked when a widget class is initialized.  That is, it is called when the first instance of a particular class is created. clientID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-24"clientabout
An application program connects to the window system server by an interprocess communication (IPC) path, such as a TCP connection or a shared memory buffer.  This program is referred to as a client of the window system server.  More precisely, the client is the IPC path itself; a program with multiple paths open to one or more servers is viewed by the protocol as multiple clients.  X Resources are available only as long as the connection remains intact, not as long as a program remains running.  Normally the connection and the program terminate concurrently, but the client's resources may live on if XChangeCloseDownMode() has been called. clipping regionID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-25"clipping region
In many graphics routines, a bitmap or list of rectangles can be specified to restrict output to a particular region of the window.  The image defined by the bitmap or rectangles is called a clipping region, or clip mask. Output to child windows is automatically clipped to the borders of the parent unless subwindow_mode of the GC is IncludeInferiors.  Therefore the borders of the parent can be thought of as a clipping region. colorcellID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-26"colorcellabout
An entry in a colormap is known as a colorcell.  An entry contains three values specifying red, green, and blue intensities.  These values are always 16-bit unsigned numbers, with zero being minimum intensity.  The values are truncated or scaled by the server to match the display hardware. See also colormap. colormapID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-27"colormapabout
A colormap consists of a set of colorcells.  A pixel value indexes into the colormap to produce intensities of Red, Green, and Blue to be displayed.  Depending on hardware limitations, one or more colormaps may be installed at one time, such that windows associated with those maps display with true colors.  Regardless of the number of installable colormaps, any number of virtual colormaps can be created.  When needed, a virtual colormap can be installed and the existing installed colormap might have to be uninstalled.  The colormap on most systems is a limited resource that should be conserved by allocating read-only colorcells whenever possible, and by selecting RGB values from the predefined color database. Read-only cells may be shared between clients. See also colorcell, DirectColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor, StaticColor, StaticGray, and TrueColor. Composite widgetID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-28"composite widgetsabout
A Composite widget is designed to manage the geometry of children; that is, a Composite widget instance can be passed in the parent argument to XtCreateWidget(). connectionID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-29"connection
The communication path between the server and the client is known as a connection.  A client usually (but not necessarily) has only one connection to the server over which requests and events are sent. Constraint widgetID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-30"constraint widgetsabout
The Constraint widget is a subclass of Composite.  A Constraint widget has more information about each child than a Composite widget. constraintsA Constraint widget provides a list of resources, or constraints, for its children.  The constraints give the Constraint widget information about how each child should be laid out. containmentID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-31"containment
A window contains the pointer if the window is viewable and if the hotspot of the cursor is within a visible region of the window or a visible region of one of its inferiors.  The border of the window is included as part of the window for containment.  The pointer is in a window if the window contains the pointer but no inferior contains the pointer. coordinate systemID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-32"coordinate system
The coordinate system has x horizontal and y vertical, with the origin (0, 0) at the upper-left.  Coordinates are discrete, and in terms of pixels.  Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate system.  For a window, the origin is inside the border, if there is one. The position of a child window is measured from the origin of the parent to the outside corner of the child (not the child's origin). Core widgetID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-33"Core widgetabout
The Core widget is the basic class in the Toolkit.  All widgets that can be displayed are subclasses of Core. cursorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-34"cursorabout
A cursor is the visible shape of the pointer on a screen.  It consists of a hotspot, a shape bitmap, a mask bitmap, and a pair of pixel values.  The cursor defined for a window controls the visible appearance of the pointer when the pointer is in that window. delete_child methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-35"methodsdelete_child; about
The delete_child method is invoked on a parent after its child is deleted.  This method is part of the Composite widget and is usually inherited. depthID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-36"depth
The depth of a window or pixmap is the number of bits per pixel. dereferenceID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-37"pointerdereferencing
To access the contents of a pointer, you must dereference it. descendantsID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-38"descendants
See inferiors. destroy methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-39"methodsdestroy; about
The destroy method is invoked when a widget has been destroyed. This method is part of the Core widget and is used to deallocate memory and GCs. deviceID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-40"device
Keyboards, mice, tablets, track-balls, button boxes, etc. are all collectively known as input devices.DirectColorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-41"DirectColorDirectColor is a visual class in which a pixel value is decomposed into three separate subfields for colormap indexing. One subfield indexes an array to produce red intensity values; the second subfield indexes a second array to produce blue intensity values; and the third subfield indexes a third array to produce green intensity values. The RGB (red, green, and blue) values in the colormap entry can be changed dynamically.  This visual class is normally found on high-performance color workstations. displayID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-42"displayabout
A display is a set of one or more screens that are driven by a single X server. The Xlib Display
structure contains all information about the particular display and its screens as well as the state that Xlib needs to communicate with the display over a particular connection.  In Xlib, a pointer to a Display
Structure is returned by XOpenDisplay().  In most Xt applications, the Display is part of the application context, and need not be referenced directly.  If necessary, a display can be opened directly with a call to XtOpenDisplay(), and a pointer to the currently open display can be returned by the XtDisplay()
macro. drawableBoth windows and pixmaps may be used as destinations in graphics operations.  These are collectively known as drawables.encapsulationID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-43"encapsulationEncapsulation is a key concept in object-oriented programming. Objects are defined in such a way that their internals are hidden from the programs that use them; the only way to access an object should be through its published interfaces. eventID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-44"eventsevent masks; about
An X event is a data structure sent by the server that describes something that just happened that may be of interest to the application.  There are two major categories of events: user input and window system side effects.  For example, the user pressing a keyboard key or clicking a mouse button generates an event; a window being moved on the screen also generates events--possibly in other applications as well if the movement changes the visible portions of their windows.  It is the server's job to distribute events to the various windows on the screen. event compressionID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-45"eventsevent compressionEvent compression is an Xt feature that allows some events to be ignored or repackaged before they are given to a widget.  This happens on the client side, rather than in the server. event handlerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-46"event handlersabout
An event handler is a function that is called by Xt when a particular event is received.  Event handlers have the same purpose as translations and actions--to call a function in response to an event--but event handlers have lower overhead and are not user-configurable. event maskID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-47"eventsevent masks; about
Events are requested relative to a window or widget.  The set of event types a client requests relative to a window is described using an event mask, a bitwise OR of defined symbols specifying which events are desired.The event_mask is a window attribute, which can be set in Xlib with XSelectInput(), and is also specified in calls that grab the pointer or keyboard. The do_not_propagate_mask attribute is also an event mask, and it specifies which events should not be propagated to ancestor windows.  In Xt, you never need to set a window's event_mask or do_not_propogate_mask directly. The translation manager automatically selects the required events. event propagationID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-48"eventsevent propagation
Device-related events propagate from the source window to ancestor windows until a window that has selected that type of event is reached, or until the event is discarded explicitly in a do_not_propagate_mask attribute. event sourceID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-49"eventsevent source
The smallest window containing the pointer is the source of a device-related event. expose methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-50"methodsexpose
When Expose events are received, the Intrinsics invoke the expose method. A widget should perform its redisplay activities in this method.  The expose method is part of the Core widget class. exposureID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-51"eventsFocusIn
Window exposure occurs when a window is first mapped, or when another window that obscures it is unmapped, resized, or moved. Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows when windows are obscured or reconfigured.  Expose events are sent to clients to inform them when contents of regions of windows have been lost and need to be regenerated. extensionID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-52"extensionsabout
Named extensions to the core protocol can be defined to extend the system.  Extension to output requests, resources, and event types are all possible, and expected.  Extensions can perform at the same level as the core Xlib. fontID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-53"fontsabout
A font is an array of characters or other bitmap shapes such as cursors.  The protocol does no translation or interpretation of character sets.  The client simply indicates values used to index the font array.  A font contains additional metric information to determine intercharacter and interline spacing. foregroundID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-54"foregroundabout
The pixel value that will actually be used for drawing pictures or text is referred to as the foreground.  The foreground is specified as a member of a graphics context.  See also background. frozen eventsID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-55"eventsfrozen
Clients can freeze event processing while they change the screen, by grabbing the keyboard or pointer with a certain mode.  These events are queued in the server (not in Xlib) until an XAllowEvents() call with a counteracting mode is given. GCID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-56"GCsgraphics contexts
The term GC is used as a shorthand for graphics context. See graphics context. geometry managementID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-57"geometry managementabout
A Composite parent controls its children through geometry management, thereby manipulating the size and placement of widgets within a window on the display. get_values_hook methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-58"methodsget_values_hook; about
The get_values_hook method is invoked by the Intrinsics when someone calls XtGetValues().  This method is part of the Core widget class.  Its role is to get the resource values of a subpart using XtGetSubvalues(). glyphID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-59"glyph
A glyph is an image, usually of a character in a font, but also possibly of a cursor shape or some other shape. grabID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-60"grabsabout
Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer, and the server can be grabbed for exclusive use by a client, usually for a short time period.  In general, these facilities help implement various styles of user interface.  Popup widgets generally make a passive grab.  Server grabs are generally used only by window managers. graphics contextID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-61"graphics contextsabout
Various information for interpreting graphics primitives is stored in a graphics context (GC), such as foreground pixel, background pixel, line width, clipping region, etc. Everything drawn to a window or pixmap is modified by the GC used in the drawing request. graphics primitiveID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-62"graphics primitive
A graphics primitive is an Xlib call that sends a protocol request to the server, instructing the server to draw a particular shape at a particular position.  The graphics context specified with the primitive specifies how the server interprets the primitive. gravityID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-63"gravity
See bit gravity and window gravity. GrayScaleID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-64"GrayScaleGrayScale is a visual class in which the red, green, and blue values in any given colormap entry are equal, thus producing shades of gray. The gray values can be changed dynamically. GrayScale can be viewed as a degenerate case of PseudoColor.hintID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-65"hintsabout
Certain properties, such as the preferred size of a window, are referred to as hints, since the window manager makes no guarantee that it will honor them. host access listID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-66"host access list
See access control list. hotspotID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-67"cursorhotspot
A cursor has an associated hotspot that defines the point in the cursor which corresponds to the coordinates reported for the pointer. identifierID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-68"identifier
Each server resource has an identifier or ID, a unique value that clients use to name the resource. Any client can use a resource if it knows the resource ID. inferiorsID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-69"inferiors
The inferiors of a window are all of the subwindows nested below it: the children, the children's children, etc.  The term descendants is a synonym. inheritance (single vs. multiple)ID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-70"inheritanceaboutInheritance is the ability to obtain methods from a superclass.  Multiple inheritance, which is not supported by Xt, would allow a class to obtain methods from multiple unrelated superclasses. initialize methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-71"methodsinitialize; about
The initialize method is invoked when a widget is created.  It initializes instance variables and checks resource values.  This method is part of the Core widget class. initialize_hook methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-72"methodsinitialize_hook; about
The initialize_hook method is called just after the initialize method, and is responsible for initializing subpart instance variables and checking subpart resource values. This method is part of the Core widget class. input focusID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-73"inputfocus
See keyboard focus. InputOnly windowID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-74"inputInputOnly window
A window that cannot be used for graphics requests is called an InputOnly window.  InputOnly
windows are invisible and can be used to control such things as cursors, input event distribution, and grabbing. InputOnly windows cannot have InputOutput windows as inferiors. InputOutput windowID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-75"inputInputOutput window
The normal kind of window that is used for both input and output is called an InputOutput window. It usually has a background. InputOutput windows can have both InputOutput
and InputOnly windows as inferiors. input managerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-76"inputmanager
Control over keyboard input may be provided by an input manager
client.  This job is more often done by the window manager. insert child methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-77"methodsinsert_child; about
A widget's insert child method is invoked when someone specifies it as a parent in an XtCreateWidget() call.  This method is part of the Composite widget class.  This method is usually inherited. instanceID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-78"instanceabout
An instance is a particular widget that has a class.  An instance ID is returned by XtCreateWidget(). instantiateWhen you instantiate a class, you create an instance of it. IntrinsicsID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-79"Intrinsicsabout
The X Toolkit defines functions and datatypes called Intrinsics. key grabbingA keyboard grab that occurs only when a certain key or key combination is pressed is called a key grab. This is analogous to button grabbing. Both are forms of passive grabs. keyboard focusID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-80"keyboardkeyboard focus; styles
The keyboard focus is the window that receives main keyboard input. By default the focus is the root window, which has the effect of sending input to the window that is being pointed to by the mouse. It is possible to attach the keyboard input to a specific window with XSetInputFocus().  Events are then sent to the window independent of the pointer position. keyboard grabbingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-81"keyboardkeyboard grabbinggrabs
All keyboard input is sent to a specific window (or client, depending on owner_events) when the keyboard is grabbed. This is analogous to mouse grabbing. This is very much like a temporary keyboard focus window. keycodeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-82"keycodesabout
A keycode is a code in the range 8-255 inclusive that represents a physical or logical key on the keyboard.  The mapping between keys and keycodes cannot be changed, and varies between servers. A list of keysyms is associated with each keycode. Programs should use keysyms instead of keycodes to interpret key events. keysymID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-83"keysymsabout
A keysym is a #define'd symbol which is a portable representation of the symbol on the cap of a key.  Each key may have several keysyms, corresponding to the key when various modifier keys are pressed. You should interpret key events according to the keysym returned by XLookupString() or XLookupKeysym(), since this translates server-dependent keycodes into portable keysyms. listenerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-84"window managerlistener
A listener style window manager sets the keyboard focus to a particular window when that window is clicked on with a pointer button. This is the window manager style used with the Apple Macintosh. This style is also referred to as click-to-type. localeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-85"Localedefinition
The international environment of a computer program defining the "localized"behavior of that program at run-time. This information can be established from one or more sets of localization data. ANSI C defines locale-specific processing by C system library calls. See ANSI C and the X/Open Portability Guide specifications for more details. In this specification, on implementations that conform to the ANSI C library, the "current locale" is the current setting of the LC_CTYPE setlocale
category. Associated with each locale is a text encoding.  When text is processed in the context of a locale, the text must be in the encoding of the locale. See the glossary in Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, for related terms. loose bindingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-86"loose bindings
A loose binding refers to the use of an asterisk (*) wildcard in a resource specification to indicate that the specification applies to zero or more hierarchy levels of widget instances or classes. mappingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-87"mappingabout
A window is said to be mapped if an XMapWindow() or XMapRaised() call has been performed on it. Unmapped windows are never viewable.  Mapping makes a window eligible for display.  The window will actually be displayed if the following conditions are also met:1) All its ancestors are mapped.2) It is not obscured by siblings.3) The window manager has processed the request, if for a top-level window. messageID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-88"messagesabout
In object-oriented programming, a message is used to invoke an object's methods.  In Xt, you can think of the Intrinsics functions used to create, destroy, and set resource values as sending messages to widget classes. methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-89"methodsabout
A method is a function internal to widget class that the Intrinsics invoke under specified conditions. Methods are provided as pointers to functions in widget class records. modal popupID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-90"popupsmodal; about
A modal popup is a popup widget that grabs the pointer when a mouse button is pressed in a particular window. modeless popupID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-91"popupsmodeless; about
A modeless popup is a popup widget that doesn't grab the pointer on a mouse button. modifier keysID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-92"modifierskeys
Shift, Control, Meta, Super, Hyper, Alt, Compose, Apple, Caps Lock, Shift Lock, and similar keys are called modifier keys. monochromeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-93"monochrome
A monochrome screen has only two colors:  black and white. Monochrome is a special case of the StaticGray visual class, in which there are only two colormap entries. non-maskable eventID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-94"nonmaskable eventseventsID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-95"eventsnonmaskable
A non-maskable event is an event that is not selected by the application or widget via an event mask, but is instead sent automatically by the X server.  The non-maskable events are MappingNotify, ClientMessage, SelectionClear, SelectionNotify, and SelectionRequest. objectID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-96"objectsabout
In object-oriented programming, an object is a self-contained program unit containing both data and procedures. object-oriented programmingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-97"objectsobject-oriented programmingObject-oriented programming is a way of defining classes and creating instances so that objects respond to messages with methods. One of its major benefits is the encapsulation of code. obscureID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-98"obscure
Window Aobscures window B if A is higher in the global stacking order, and the rectangle defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B.  See occlude. occludeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-99"occlude
Window Aoccludes window B if both are mapped, if A is higher in the global stacking order, and if the rectangle defined by the outside edges of A
intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B. The (fine) distinction between the terms obscures and occludes is that for obscures, the windows have to be mapped, while for occludes they don't. Also note that window borders are included in the calculation. Note that InputOnly
windows never obscure other windows but can occlude other windows. paddingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-100"padding
Some bytes are inserted in the data stream to maintain alignment of the protocol requests on natural boundaries.  This padding increases ease of portability to some machine architectures. parentID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-101"parentabout
A  parent is a Composite widget instance specified as the parent argument in XtCreateWidget().  Parents control a child's layout. parent windowID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-102"parentwindow
Each new window is created with reference to another previously-created window.  The new window is referred to as the child, and the reference window as the parent. If C is a child of P, then P is the parent of C. Only the portion of the child that overlaps the parent is viewable. passive grabID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-103"grabspassive
A passive grab is a grab that will become active only when a specific key or button is actually pressed in a particular window. pixel valueID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-104"pixel valuesabout
A pixel value is an N-bit value, where N is the number of bit planes used in a particular window or pixmap.  For a window, a pixel value indexes a colormap to derive an actual color to be displayed.  For a pixmap, a pixel value will be interpreted as a color in the same way when it has been copied into a  window. pixmapID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-105"pixmapabout
A pixmap is a three-dimensional array of bits.  A pixmap is normally thought of as a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel can be a value from 0 to 'br (2N-1), where N is the depth (z-axis) of the pixmap.  A pixmap can also be thought of as a stack of N bitmaps. A pixmap may have only one plane.  Such a pixmap is often referred to as a bitmap, even though there is no bitmap type in X11.   See also bitmap. planeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-106"plane
When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps, each bitmap is called a plane. ID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-107"planebit planeplane maskID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-108"plane mask
Graphics operations can be restricted to affect only a subset of bit planes in a drawable.  A plane mask is a bit mask describing which planes are to be modified. pointerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-109"pointerabout
The pointer is the pointing device currently attached to the cursor, and tracked on the screens.  This may be a mouse, tablet, track-ball, or joystick. pointer grabbingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-110"pointergrabbing
A client can actively grab control of the pointer, causing button and motion events to be sent to that client rather than to the client the pointer indicates. pointing deviceID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-111"pointerdevice
A pointing device is typically a mouse or tablet, or some other device with effective two-dimensional motion, that usually has buttons.  There is only one visible cursor defined by the core protocol, and it tracks whatever pointing device is currently attached as the pointer. popupID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-112"popupsabout
A popup is a widget outside the normal parental hierarchy of geometry management.  It is a child window of the root window that is popped up temporarily to give the user a piece of information, or to get some information from the user. post-order traversalID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-113"traversalpost-order
When a tree structure is subject to post-order traversal, its root is visited last; for example, a function might process the left descendant, the right descendant, and then the root. pre-order traversalID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-114"traversalpre-order
When a tree structure is subject to pre-order traversal, its root is visited first; for example, a function might process the root, and then the left and right descendant. private header fileID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-115"header filesprivate
A private header file contains the internal class definitions of a widget.  For example, the Label widget's internal class definitions are contained in the private header file LabelP.h. This file is included only in the widget .c file of this class and any subclasses, never in the application. propertyID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-116"propertiesabout
Windows may have associated properties, each consisting of a name, a type, a data format, and some data.  The protocol places no interpretation on properties; they are intended as a general-purpose data storage and intercommunication mechanism for clients.  There is, however, a list of predefined properties and property types so that clients might share information such as resize hints, program names, and icon formats with a window manager via properties. In order to avoid passing arbitrary-length property-name strings, each property name is associated with a corresponding integer value known as an atom.  See also atom. PseudoColorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-117"PseudoColorPseudoColor is a visual class in which a pixel value indexes the colormap entry to produce independent red, green, and blue values. That is, the colormap is viewed as an array of triples (RGB values). The RGB values can be changed dynamically. public header fileID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-118"header filespublic
A public header file contains the declarations (e.g., class widget pointer) necessary to use a widget.  For example, labelWidgetClass declarations are contained in the public header file label.h. This header file is included in the widget .c file and in the application source file. quarkID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-119"quarks
A quark is an integer ID that identifies a string.  In the context of Xt, this string is usually a name, class, or type string for the resource manager.  Like atoms and resource IDs, quarks eliminate the need to pass strings of arbitrary length over the network.  The quark type is XrmQuark, and the types XrmName, XrmClass, and XrmRepresentation
are also defined to be XrmQuark. query geometry methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-120"methodsquery_geometry; about
Parents call XtQueryGeometry() to invoke the child's query geometry method to find out a child's preferred geometry.  This method is part of the Core widget class. raiseID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-121"raise
Changing the stacking order of a window so as to occlude all sibling windows is to raise that window. real estateID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-122"window managerreal estate driven
The window management style characterized by the input being sent to whichever window the pointer is in is called real-estate-driven. This is the most common style of input management used in X. realize methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-123"methodsrealize; about
The realize method creates a window on the display and is part of the Core widget class. rectangleID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-124"rectangle
A rectangle specified by [x,y,w,h] has an (infinitely thin) outline path with corners at [x,y], [x+w,y], [x+w,y+h], and [x,y+h]. When a rectangle is filled, the lower-right edges are not drawn. For example, if w=h=0, nothing would be drawn when drawing the rectangle, but a single pixel when filling it. For w=h=1, a single pixel would be drawn when drawing the rectangle, four pixels when filling it. redirectID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-125"window managerredirect
Window managers (or other clients) may wish to enforce window layout policy in various ways.  When a client attempts to change the size or position of a window, or to map one, the operation may be redirected to the window manager, rather than actually being performed.  Then the window manager (or other client that redirected the input) is expected to decide whether to allow, modify, or deny the requested operation before making the call itself. See also window manager. reparentingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-126"reparentingwindow managerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-127"window managerreparenting
The window manager often reparents the top-level windows of each application in order to add a title bar and perhaps resize boxes.  In other words, a window with a title bar is inserted between the root window and each top-level window.  See also save-set.replyID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-128"reply
Information requested from the server by a client is sent back to the client in a reply.  Both events and replies are multiplexed on the same connection with the requests.  Requests that require replies are known as round-trip requests, and, if possible, should be avoided since they introduce network delays. Most requests do not generate replies.  Some requests generate multiple replies.  Xt caches frequently-used data on the client side of the connection in order to minimize the need for round-trip requests. See Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual, for a detailed discussion of the X Protocol. representation typeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-129"representation typesabout
A symbolic constant beginning with XtR, which is defined in <X11/StringDefs.h> or an application or widget header file, and which is used to define the data type of a resource.  Xt automatically converts between resource settings, which are strings, and various representation types. requestID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-130"serverrequest
A command to the server is called a request.  It is a single block of data sent over the connection to the server. See Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual, for a detailed discussion of the X Protocol. resize methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-131"methodsresize; about
The resize method of a widget is called when the widget's parent has changed its size.  This method is part of the Core widget class. In composite widgets, this method calculates a new layout for the children.  In simple widgets, this method recalculates instance variables so that the expose method can redraw the widget properly. resourceID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-132"resourcesabout
1) A widget or application variable whose value can be set by the user or application programmer via the Resource Manager.2) In the X Protocol and server documentation, windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, graphics contexts, and colormaps are known as resources.  They all have unique identifiers (IDs) associated with them for naming purposes. resource databaseID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-133"resourcesdatabase; about
The resource database is the collection of possible places where resource specifications can be made.  The most important of these are the app-defaults file, where the programmer specifies resource defaults, the RESOURCE_MANAGER server property, which the user can set with xrdb, and the .Xdefaults file in the user's home directory, where he or she specifies local resource preferences. Resource ManagerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-134"Resource Manager
The Resource Manager is a part of Xlib that merges a database consisting of several ASCII files, a server property, and values hardcoded by the application, and determines a unique value for each resource of each widget.  It resolves conflicts between multiple settings for the same resource according to its internal precedence rules, and provides the widget or application with the resulting value. resource settingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-135"resourcessetting; about
A resource setting is the actual value of a resource variable. resource specificationID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-136"resourcesspecifications; about
A resource specification describes a "pathname" to a widget resource, using widget class and/or instance names, resource class or instance names, and optional wildcards.  For example, the resource specification:xbox.box.quit.label: Quitspecifies that the label resource of the quit widget, which is contained in the box widget in the xbox application, should be set to "Quit."  The specification:*Command.background: blue which uses wildcards and widget classes, specifies that the background (color) resource of all Command widgets in any application should be set to "blue."  It is up to the Resource Manager to resolve differences between resource specifications, which may have varying levels of specificity in the various locations that make up the resource database. RGB valuesSee colorcell. rootID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-137"root window
The root of a window, pixmap, or graphics context (GC) is the same as the root window of whatever drawable was specified in the call to create the window, pixmap, or GC. These resources can be used only on the screen indicated by this window. See root window. root windowID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-138"root window
Each screen has a root window covering it.  It cannot be reconfigured or unmapped, but otherwise acts as a full-fledged window.  A root window has no parent. round-trip requestID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-139"serverround trip request
A request to the server that generates a reply is known as a round-trip request.  See reply. save-setID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-140"window managersave-set
The save-set of a client is a list of other clients' windows which, if they are inferiors of one of the client's windows at connection close, should not be destroyed, and which should be reparented and remapped if the client is unmapped.  Save-sets are typically used by window managers to avoid lost windows if the manager should terminate abnormally.  See reparenting for more background information. scan lineID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-141"scan line
A scan line is a list of pixel or bit values viewed as a horizontal row (all values having the same y coordinate) of an image, with the values ordered by increasing x coordinate values. scan line orderID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-142"scan line
An image represented in scan line order contains scan lines ordered by increasing y coordinate values. screenID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-143"screenabout
A screen may not have physically independent monitors. For instance, it is possible to treat a color monitor as if it were two screens, one color and the other black and white or to have two separate color and monochrome screens controlled by one server. There is only a single keyboard and pointer shared among the screens. A Screen
structure contains the information about each screen and the list is a member of the Display
structure. scrollbarID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-144"scrollbarsabout
A scrollbar is an area on a window that allows a user to view different portions of a window's information by scrolling, or moving. selectionID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-145"selectionsaboutSelections are a means of communication between clients using properties and events.  From the user's perspective, a selection is an item of data which can be highlighted in one instance of an application and pasted into another instance of the same or a different application. The client that highlights the data is the owner, and the client into which the data is pasted is the requestor. Properties are used to store the selection data and the type of the data, while events are used to synchronize the transaction and to allow the requestor to indicate the type it prefers for the data and to allow the owner to convert the data to the indicated type if possible. serverID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-146"serverabout
The server provides the basic windowing mechanism.  It handles IPC connections from clients, demultiplexes graphics requests onto the screens, and multiplexes input back to the appropriate clients.  It controls a single keyboard and pointer and one or more screens that make up a single display. server grabbingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-147"servergrabbing
The server can be grabbed by a single client for exclusive use.  This prevents processing of any requests from other client connections until the grab is complete.  This is typically a transient state for such tasks as rubber-banding, or to execute requests indivisibly. set_values methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-148"methodsset_values; about
The Intrinsics invoke a widget's set_values method when one of the widget's resource values is changed.  This method should return TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the widget's expose method should be invoked. set_values_almost methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-149"methodsset_values_almost; about
The set_values_almost method is invoked when a parent rejects a widget's geometry request, but the parent sends back a compromise.  This method is part of the Core widget class. set_values_hook methodID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-150"methodsset_values_hook; about
A widget can provide a set_values_hook method to allow the application to set resources of subparts. siblingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-151"sibling
Children of the same parent window are known as sibling windows. spring-loaded popupID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-152"spring-loaded menupopupsID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-153"popupsspring-loaded
When a button press triggers a popup, the popup is called a spring-loaded popup. stacking orderID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-154"stacking order
Sibling windows may stack on top of each other, obscuring lower windows.  This is similar to papers on a desk.  The relationship between sibling windows is known as the stacking order.
The first window in the stacking order is the window on top. StaticColorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-155"StaticColor
The StaticColor visual class represents a multiplane color screen with a predefined and read-only hardware colormap. It can be viewed as a degenerate case of PseudoColor. See PseudoColor. StaticGrayID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-156"StaticGray
The StaticGray visual class represents a multiplane monochrome screen with a predefined and read-only hardware colormap. It can be viewed as a degenerate case of GrayScale, in which the gray values are predefined and read-only.  Typically, the values are linearly increasing ramps. See GrayScale. stippleID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-157"stipple
A stipple is a single plane pixmap that is used to tile a region. Bits set to 1 in the stipple are drawn with a foreground pixel value; bits set to 0, with a background pixel value.  The stipple and both pixel values are members of the GC. statusID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-158"status
Many Xlib functions return a status of TRUE or FALSE. If the function does not succeed, its return arguments are not disturbed. subclassID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-159"subclassabout
A widget subclass has its own features plus many of the features of its superclasses. For example, since Composite is a subclass of Core, Composite has all the fields in Core plus its own unique fields. A subclass can inherit or replace most superclass features. superclassID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-160"superclassabout
One widget is a superclass of a second widget when the second widget includes the first, or the Core widget is a superclass of the Composite widget because the Composite widget's definition depends on, or includes, the Core widget. tight bindingID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-161"tight bindings
A tight binding refers to the use of a dot (.) in a resource specification to indicate that the widget class or instance on the right side of the dot is a child of the widget whose class or instance name is on the left side of it. tileID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-162"tilingabout
A pixmap can be replicated in two dimensions to tile a region.  The pixmap itself is also known as a tile. timeID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-163"time
A time value in X is expressed in milliseconds, typically since the last server reset. Time values wrap around (after about 49.7 days). One time value, represented by the constant CurrentTime, is used by clients to represent the current server time. top-level windowID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-164"top-levelwindow
A child of the root window is referred to as a top-level window. translationID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-165"translationsabout
A translation maps an event or event sequence into an action name. Once a translation is installed in a widget, the named action function will be invoked when the specified event sequence occurs in the widget. Translations are specified as ASCII strings. translation tableID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-166"translationstranslation table
A translation table lists one or more translations. TrueColorID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-167"TrueColor
The TrueColor visual class represents a high-performance multiplane display with predefined and read-only RGB values in its hardware colormap.  It can be viewed as a degenerate case of DirectColor, in which the subfields in the pixel value directly encode the corresponding RGB values. Typically, the values are linearly increasing ramps. See DirectColor. type propertyID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-168"type property
A type property is used to identify the interpretation of property data.  Types are completely uninterpreted by the server; they are solely for the benefit of clients. viewableID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-169"windowviewable
A window is viewable if it and all of its ancestors are mapped.  This does not imply that any portion of the window is actually visible, since it may be obscured by other windows. visibleID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-170"windowvisible
A region of a window is visible if someone looking at the screen can actually see it; that is, the window is viewable and the region is not obscured by any other window. visualID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-171"windowvisual
The specifications for color handling for a window, including visual class, depth, RGB/pixel, etc., are collectively referred to as a visual, and are stored in a structure of type Visual. visual classID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-172"visual classVisual class refers to DirectColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor, StaticColor, StaticGray, or TrueColor. It is a definition of the colormap type but not its depth. widgetID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-173"widgetsabout
The basic object in a toolkit, a widget includes both code and data, and can therefore serve as an input or output object. window gravityID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-174"windowgravity
When windows are resized, subwindows may be repositioned automatically by the server, relative to an edge, corner, or center of the window.  This attraction of a subwindow to some part of its parent is known as window gravity.
Window gravity is a window attribute.  See also bit gravity. window managerID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-175"window managerabout
The user manipulates windows on the screen using a window manager client. The window manager has authority over the arrangement of windows on the screen, and the user interface for selecting which window receives input.  See also redirect. XYPixmapID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-176"pixmapXYPixmap format
The data for an image is said to be in XYPixmap format if it is organized as a set of bitmaps representing individual bit planes. This applies only to the server's internal data format for images. It does not affect normal programming with pixmaps. ZPixmapID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-177"pixmapZPixmap format
The data for an image is said to be in ZPixmap format if it is organized as a set of pixel values in scan line order. This applies only to the server's internal data format for images. It does not affect normal programming with pixmaps. zoomed windowID="IX-1013-GLOSSARY-178"windowzoomed
Some applications have not only a normal size for their top-level window and an icon, but also a zoomed window size.  This could be used in a painting program (similar to the MacPaint fat bits).  The zoomed window size preferences can be specified in the window manager hints.
