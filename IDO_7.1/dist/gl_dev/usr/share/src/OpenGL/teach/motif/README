This directory contains very simple programs which illustrate
how to use the OpenGL Motif widget.

simplest.c	- minimal motif program - uses a single widget, but
		  handles expose, resize, and keyboard events

simple-popup.c	- minimal motif program with popup menu - uses a single
		  widget, but handles expose, resize, and keyboard events.
		  RIGHTMOUSE activates menu.

mouse.c		- simple double buffered motif program using mouse motion
		  events to update viewing transform
		  LEFTMOUSE pans, MIDDLEMOUSE rotates about X and Y axes,
		  LEFTMOUSE+MIDDLEMOUSE zooms

animate.c	- simple double buffered motif program.  uses an Xt
		  work proc to do animation.  popup menu is used to
		  enable and disable work proc

multi-widget.c	- uses two drawing area widgets with potentially different
		  dimensions with a single GLX context.  Also includes
		  a quit button.  The interactions are the same as in mouse.c

overlay.c	- a modification of the animate.c program which also creates
		  a transparent overlay window using the visual_info extension.
		  The program draws a static grid in the overlay window and
		  resizes or redraws the overlay window whenever it is
		  necessary.  The overlay window and main window are each
		  a separate drawing area widget and the two are sandwiched
		  together inside a form widget.

switch-visual.c	- another modification of the animate.c program which creates
		  two context/visual/widget pairs -- one single buffered
		  and one double buffered.  A cascading popup menu allows
		  the user to switch between the two visuals.
