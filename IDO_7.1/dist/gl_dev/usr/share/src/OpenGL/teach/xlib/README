This directory contains very simple programs which demonstrate
how to write OpenGL programs using only Xlib

too-simple.c	- this program is from the glXIntro man page. its here
		  to demonstrate the most minimal xlib program, but its
		  not recommended for general use since it doesn't
		  deal with expose, resize or any type of input.

simplest.c	- minimal xlib program - draws simple geometry and
		  has simple event loop which deals with expose, resize
		  and keyboard events.

mouse.c		- simple double buffered xlib program using mouse motion
		  events to update viewing transform
		  LEFTMOUSE pans, MIDDLEMOUSE rotates about X and Y axes,
		  LEFTMOUSE+MIDDLEMOUSE zooms

animate.c	- simple double buffered xlib program.  uses spacebar
		  to stop and start animation.  uses MapNotify and UnmapNotify
		  events to disable animation while window is unmapped.

image.c		- simple single buffered RGB program which displays
		  an SGI image library (libimage) file.
		  Usage: image [-n] file.rgb

overlay.c	- a modification of the animate.c program which also creates
		  a transparent overlay window using the visual_info extension.
		  the program draws a static grid in the overlay window and
		  resizes or redraws the overlay window whenever it is
		  necessary.

pixmap.c	- demonstrates OpenGL rendering to an X11 pixmap.
