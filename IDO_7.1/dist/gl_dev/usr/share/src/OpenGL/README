To build all of the OpenGL samples, type make. Look in the
makefile for the order in which directories must be built.

You can set the different object styles by setting the env variable GLSTYLE:

    setenv GLSTYLE 32
    setenv GLSTYLE n32
    setenv GLSTYLE 64

Note that all three styles are made by default.
If you do set one of the style flags above, do the following also:

    setenv INSTOPTS -t

This will insure that make install will still work since make install
will try to install all three styles.

You can enable debugging by setting the env variable GLDEBUG:

    setenv GLDEBUG y
