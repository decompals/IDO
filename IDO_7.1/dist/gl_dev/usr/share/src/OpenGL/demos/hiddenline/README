hiddenline.c -	Xlib-based program which uses the PolygonOffset
		extension to do a hidden line rendering.  Depth
		buffered black polygons are used to occlude the
		hidden lines.  The PolygonOffset extension offsets
		the polygons slightly so that their edges do not
		interfere with the lines.  The program shows an
		ordinary wireframe drawing, a hidden-line drawing
		without PolygonOffset, and a hidden-line drawing
		with PolygonOffset side-by-side so that it's easy
		to compare the three techniques.
