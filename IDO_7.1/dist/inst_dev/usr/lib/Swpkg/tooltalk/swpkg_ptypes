   MSG_EDIT_INSTALLATION is used by sgdx (Doug Young's Builder)
   and takes four string arguments:
  
      'cwd'	Directory to take the user too
      'spec'	Pathname of spec file to open	(application.spec)
      'idb'	Pathname of idb file to open	(application.idb)
      'distdir'	Distribution Directory pathname	(images)
  
   Specifying NULL for any of the argument values causes it to be ignored.
