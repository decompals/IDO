About the Static Analyzer
The Static Analyzer is a cross-reference tool for analyzing and navigating source code. It provides structural and relational information for C, C++, Fortran, or Ada (with purchase of ProDev Ada). You can analyze programs that don't compile, a useful feature when porting code.
Run the mouse over the main Static Analyzer window for a brief description of each of its functions. Click the bottom right arrow button when you are done.
