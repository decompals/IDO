"Call Tree View" is used when a "Function" query has been made.  It displays a tree diagram of functions and the static calls between functions.
"Class Tree View" is used when a "Class" query has been made.  It displays a class inheritance tree.
"File Dependency View" is used when a "File" query has been made.  It displays a tree diagram of the relationship between files.
