The ProDev WorkShop Advantage
ProDev WorkShop contains a Static Analyzer, a Debugger, and a Performance Analyzer.
These tools work cooperatively with each other.  They share information to maximize your power during any one task.

ProDev WorkShop also contains a build manager tool and a tester tool that will not be reviewed in this tutorial.
