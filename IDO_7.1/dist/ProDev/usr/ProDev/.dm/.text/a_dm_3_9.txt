#3.9
Specifying a Fileset
To build a static analysis database, you specify a set of source files (a fileset) and whether the database is to be built in parser mode (using the compiler) or in scanner mode (fast but language-insensitive).
Run the mouse over the Fileset Editor for descriptions.  Click the right arrow button when you are done.

The directory selection features let you specify a directory containing source files you want to analyze.
The directory move controls let you specify whole directories (and their subdirectories) to be included in the fileset in parser or scanner mode.
The Files selection features allow you to specify individual files.  
The file move controls allow you to include selected files in the fileset in either parser or scanner mode.
The fileset scrolling lists let you see which files are specified for parser mode and which are specified for scanner mode.
The Current Fileset field allows you to name the current fileset.
The language filter toggles let you select all source files written in that language.
