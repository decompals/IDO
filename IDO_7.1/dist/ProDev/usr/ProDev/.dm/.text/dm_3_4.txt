When you start the Static Analyzer with the -e option...

		% cvstatic -e [your_program] 

...your code is automatically "scanned" into the Static Analyzer.  


"Scanning" your code means that high-level static information is gathered and stored into a database.  This "Scanner" mode is great for quick program overviews because it's very fast and works on code that can't be compiled.
