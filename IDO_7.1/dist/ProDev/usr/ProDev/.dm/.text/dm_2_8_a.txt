The ProDev WorkShop Advantage
This tool has the capability to number each line of code, but the default is no line numbers.  To have the line numbers shown, you must select Show Line Numbers from the Display menu.  Here we show the code with the  line numbers.
The Debugger numbers each line of code.  Click to the left of a line number to set a breakpoint.  

Click again to remove the breakpoint.  When you are finished, click on the bottom right arrow to continue.
