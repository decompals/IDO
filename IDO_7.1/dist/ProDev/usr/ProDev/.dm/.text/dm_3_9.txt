Display File Dependencies
To graphically display the files dependencies of your program, "query" the database for a complete file listing. 

Then go to the "View" menu and choose the graphic file dependency view.  
Use the "Queries" and "View" menus to display your code's file dependencies.
Sorry.  You must first go to the "Query" menu and choose "List all files..."
Sorry.  You have already queried the database.

Now, go to the "View" menu and choose "File Dependencies"
