Getting Call Stack Information
The CallStack window displays the function; arguments names,values and types; the function's source file and line number, and the PC at the current context.  Double-clicking a frame in the CallStack displays the corresponding source code.
Double-click the "iterate" stack frame to shift the stack from the iterate function.  
Notice the stack frame has been shifted from the iterate function.  The source code display in the Debugger also updates.
