Display File Dependencies
Great.  This is a graphical depiction of the file dependencies in your code.

This graph also allows you to directly view any file's code, identify the exact reason for file dependencies, and hide/show children nodes.
Click on any node and then hold down your right mouse button.

Select a menu option from the menu that appears.
