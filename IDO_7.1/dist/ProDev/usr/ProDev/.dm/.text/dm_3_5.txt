Set Up Your Files
You can also ask the Static Analyzer to "parse" your code for detailed run-time information, such as pointer and data-type definitions.  

"Parser" mode takes longer and uses more memory, so its best used on specific files for detailed run-time information. You must be able to compile code to use parser mode.
