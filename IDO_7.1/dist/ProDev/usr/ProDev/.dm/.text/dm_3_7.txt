Using the Static Analyzer
The Static Analyzer extracts structure and location information from your code and organizes it into a database.  
This database lets you visually analyze your code's structure and locate where program elements are used or defined.  During static analysis, you "query" this database for code information.  
Click on the "Queries" menu to review the information stored in the Static Analyzer database.

"List All Global Symbols" returns all functions, macros, variables, classes, etc. found in your program files.
"List All Constants" returns all constants in the source code.
"Where Symbol Used" expects yu to type in a symbol (for example, function, macro, variable, etc.) and then identifies all source code locations where that symbol is referenced.
"Where Defined?" expects you to type in a symbol (for example, function, macro, variable, etc.) and then identifies all source code locations where that symbol is defined.
"Find String" expects you to type in a string and then identifies all source code locations that match that string.
"Find Regular Expression" expects you to type in a a general expression and then identifies all source code locations that match that regular expression string.
"List All Macros" returns all macros it finds in your program.
"Where Defined?" expects you to type in a macro name and returns the source code locations where the macro is defined.
"Where Undefined?"  expects you to type in a macro name and returns the source code locations where the macro is undefined.
"Who Uses?"  expects you to type in a macro name and returns the source code locations where the macro is used.
"List Unused Macros" lists all macros that are defined, but never used.
