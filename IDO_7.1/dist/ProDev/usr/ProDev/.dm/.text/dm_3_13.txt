Identify Source Files Using Include Files
To graphically display class hierarchies, "query" the database for a complete file listing. 

Then go to the "View" menu and choose the graphic file dependency view.  
Use the "Queries" and "View" menus to display your code's file dependencies.
Sorry.  You must first go to the "Query" menu and choose "List all files..."
Sorry.  You have already queried the database.

Now, go to the "View" menu and choose "File Dependencies"
