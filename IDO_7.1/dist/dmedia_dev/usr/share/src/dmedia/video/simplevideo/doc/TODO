* add control setting, method for returning errors;

* whack something in so it will work on *all* flavors of ev1;

* Add a routine to exit a context;

* When calling getframe, when we set the data ptr,
  make sure it isn't allready pointing at an malloced
  block!  If it is, we need to free it first!

* Hey, will different contexts in the same thread share the
  same server connection?

* Here's an idea - it might be interesting to have a function
  svWaitForPreemption() to keep a path open until someone
  else comes along...
