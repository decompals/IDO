		    README for video programming examples

This directory has example video programs for the SGI Video Library
that have been re-written in OpenGL.

The rest of the example programs appear in the Programmers' Guide. 
NOTE: In order to keep these examples as simple as possible event 
handling is not implemented in most of them. This means the examples
will not update their windows if they are moved.

contcapt:    
--------

Contcapt continuously captures a stream of live video to 
memory. Command line options provide the ability to set the 
number of memory buffers used in capture, set the number of 
frames to be captured, choose whether to display the video 
in a window on the computer's display, set the frame geometry 
and zoom ratio, set the frame rate and to report statistics
on frame rate.

vidtomem:
--------

Vidtomem captures a stream of video to memory and disk. 
Command line options provide the ability to set the filename 
of the file to receive the video data, disable writing the 
video data to disk, set frame size and zoom ratio and set
the output mode (RGB or YUV).

The OpenGL version calls "showgl" (included) to display
the image instead of the original "ipaste".

mtov:
----

Mtov is a simple example program that plays a movie-library movie out
the video output port.  Mtov requires video hardware with a video
output port.

Mtov has been enhanced to load all frames into memory with 
the "-n" switch and then blast them out as fast
as possible. Use with caution, since RAM is small
relative to movies!!

showgl
------

A simple program, similar to "ipaste", that displays an 
iris image to the display.
