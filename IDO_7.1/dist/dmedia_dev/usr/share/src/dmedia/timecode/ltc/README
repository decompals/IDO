LTC (longitudinal time code) is a scheme for encoding SMPTE time code 
information in an audio signal. LTC is the format used to stripe 
SMPTE timecode onto an audio tape or onto a longitudinal audio track on 
a video tape. For in-depth information about various time code formats
and their encoding, consult a reference such as ``Timecode: A User's
Guide'' by John Ratcliff, published by Focal Press, ISBN 0 240 51334 7.

There are two example programs in this directory, readltc and dmltc.

The dmltc example makes use of the LTC and time code support functions
in the Digital Media Library (libdmedia).  These are described in the
man pages dmLTC(3dm), dmTCAddTC(3dm), dmTCAddFrames(3dm),
dmTCFramesBetween(3dm), dmTCFramesPerDay(3dm), dmTCToSeconds(3dm),
dmTCFromSeconds(3dm), dmTCToString(3dm), and dmTCFromString(3dm).  The
dmltc program reads from an audio port via the audio library (AL) and
attempts to decode an LTC sequence in it.

The readltc program does not use the Digital Media library's supporting
functions, rather it has all of the decode logic right in it.

There are two ways in which readltc may be run.

If invoked as:  readltc filename.aiff
   readltc will read the file into memory, then decode the memory image as
   quickly as it can (much faster than real time).

Alternately if invoked w/o arguments:  readltc
   It will open a mono audio library input and decode ltc from that
   stream in real time.  A suggested test would be to use apanel to
   configure digital loopthrough, and to use playaifc to play the
   supplied aiff file:

   Make sure that nothing is plugged into the digital audio port, then
   type:

      apanel -source digital -outrate 22050
      readltc
      soundplayer smpte.aifc  (then hit the play button)

   Timecode should now be scrolling.  Experiment by changing the
   output rate up and down.  This corresponds to non-realtime
   cueing modes on a deck.  The audio file may be played repeatedly
   by selecting the play button on the soundplayer panel.

The timecode fields are displayed in the output from "readltc":

	forward/reverse:
		indicates direction of tape movement

	hours : minutes : seconds : frames

	ug:	user group bits 

                There are 8 user groups in an LTC time-
                code, each 4 bits long. User group bits are displayed
                in the order ug0 ... ug7.

	df:	drop flag bit value

	cf:	color lock flag bit value

	ua:    	unassigned bits from positions 27, 43, 58, 59 in the
                80-bit LTC timecode word
