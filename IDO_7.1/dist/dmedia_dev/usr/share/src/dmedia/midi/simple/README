Some simple MIDI examples.

simple_scale.c	- Plays a 12-note ascending scale eight times, using a 
		  different program number for each scale.  This is a 
		  good example to start with.

scale.c  	- Plays a scale in a specified mode.  This is a fairly complete
	   	  example that provides extensive control over how the scale
	          is played.  For a simpler example, check out simple_scale.c.

thru.c 		- Automatically copies MIDI messages from an input port to
		  an output port (a process knowing as "thruing").  This
		  program can be useful if you have a controller keyboard
		  connected to a MIDI input port and a tone generator 
		  connected to a MIDI output port and you simply want to
		  control the tone generator from the keyboard.

panic.c		- Turns off any stuck notes which might be left behind by
		  a buggy or interrupted MIDI application.  See the header
		  comment in panic.c for more information.
