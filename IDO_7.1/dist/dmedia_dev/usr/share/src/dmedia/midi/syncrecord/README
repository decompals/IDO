The syncrecord directory contains example programs that 
illustrate synchronized audio/MIDI recording and playback:

	- recordmidi.c++
	- playmidi.c++

Both programs demonstrate the use of synchronization primitives
in the MIDI Library (libmd) and the Audio Library (libaudio).

These programs also demonstrate use of the MIDI File Library
(libmidifile) which is provided as example source code. This
library allows you to read and write standard MIDI files.

recordmidi.c++:
	Records a MIDI file and audio file starting at the
	same time. Recordmidi.c++ creates test.mid and test.aifc
	by default, although alternate file names can be
	provided on the command line.

playmidi.c++:
	Plays the files created by recordmidi.c++. The file
	playback is synchronized by starting both files at
	the same time.
