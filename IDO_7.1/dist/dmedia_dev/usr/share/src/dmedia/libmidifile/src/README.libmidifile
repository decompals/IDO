I. Overview

The README provides an overview of the library "libmidifile". The main
function of libmidifile is to provide an interface to reading and writing
on-disk standard MIDI files. Two other READMEs, README.MFfile and 
README.MFtrack describe the methods associated with the MIDI File
abstraction. In addition to reading and writing MIDI Files, libmidifile
provides some useful function for MIDI Files events.

Include: #include <libmidifile.h>
Link:    -llibmidifile


II. MFfile, MFtrack, MFfileEvent, MDevent, and MFmeta

Several new classes have been defined for libmidifile. MDevent is provided
by the digital media midi library. MFmeta is a class which represents
Meta events. MFfileEvents are a container for MFmeta and MDevent objects.
An MFtrack is a time-ordered list of MFfileEvents. An MFfile is a list
of MFtrack objects.
