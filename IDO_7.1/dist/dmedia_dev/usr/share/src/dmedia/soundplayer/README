playaifc:    
--------

Playaifc parses AIFF-C (and AIFF) file(s) containing 8-bit or
16-bit audio sample data (single channel or stereo)
and plays the samples through the audio hardware.

Playaifc supports decompression of CCITT G.722, CCITT G.711 u-law,
Aware MPEG, and Aware MultiRate AIFF-C file formats.

Please see the man page for more details.

recordaifc:
----------

Recordaifc creates an AIFF-C (or AIFF) output file 
containing 16-bit stereo sample data recorded 
through the audio hardware.  Recordaiff records 
audio input until the user sends it an interrupt. 
It writes the current hardware input sample rate 
into the appropriate location in the AIFF Common 
chunk.  When recordaiff receives a user interrupt, 
it writes all sample data
currently in the audio buffer out to disk before it
exits. 

Recordaifc supports compressing to CCITT G.722 4:1, CCITT G.711 
u-law 2:1, Aware MPEG, and Aware MultiRate compression for the 
AIFF-C file format.

Please see the man page for more details.

aifcinfo:    
--------

Parses an AIFF or AIFF-C file and prints out a 
detailed description of the audio data and header
information inside the file.

aiff2aifc, aifc2aiff, aifccompress, aifcdecompress:
---------------------------------------------------

These sample programs are all generated from the same
source file:   aifcconvert.c

aiff2aifc: 
    Converts an AIFF file to the newer AIFF-C standard
    format. Preserves all header and auxiliary information
    (strings, MIDI exclusive data, etc) during the conversion.

aifc2aiff:
    Converts an AIFF-C file to the older AIFF format.
    Preserves all header and auxiliary data chunks (strings,
    MIDI exclusive data, etc) common to both formats.

    Provides backward compatability for applications which
    do not support the newer AIFF-C format. Applications 
    linked with the SGI Audio File Library can automatically
    parse files in either format. 

aifccompress:
    Converts an AIFF-C file which contains uncompressed audio data to
    an AIFF-C file which contains compressed data. Nonaudio and 
    auxiliary header information is preserved.

    Compression algorithms supported by the SGI Audio File Library are:
    CCITT G.722 ADPCM, CCITT G.711 mu-law, CCITT G.722 A-law, and
    Aware MPEG and MultiRate algorithms.
    The SGI Audio File Library does not support Apple proprietary
    compression schemes. 

aifcdecompress:
    Converts an AIFF-C file which contains compressed audio data to
    an AIFF-C file which contains uncompressed data. Nonaudio and
    auxiliary header information is preserved.
