playaifc / sfplay
-----------------

Playaifc parses AIFF-C, AIFF, WAVE, Sun/NeXT, MPEG-1 layer I and II
audio bitstream, IRCAM BICSF, and Sound Designer II file(s)
and plays the samples through the audio hardware.

Playaifc supports decompression of CCITT G.722, CCITT G.711 u-law,
MPEG-1 layers I and II, and Aware MultiRate data stored in AIFF-C files.

Please see the man page for more details.

Previous IRIX releases included two slightly different command-line
programs for playing back audio data: "playaifc" and "sfplay". 
The former program played back only AIFF-C and AIFF files, but was
written on top of the Audio File Library and was capable of handling
AIFF-C files containing compressed data. The latter program was not
written on top of the Audio File Library, but handled Sun/NeXT and WAVE
files (as well as raw audio data files).

For IRIX 6.2, the two programs have been merged into a single program which
is written on top of the Audio File Library. The Audio File Library
now supports all the formats described in the first paragraph above.
The combined program understands both the "playaifc" command-line
syntax and the "sfplay" command-line syntax.


recordaifc:
----------

Recordaifc creates an AIFF-C (or AIFF) output file 
containing audio stereo sample data recorded 
through the audio hardware.  Recordaifc records 
audio input until the user sends it an interrupt. 
It writes the current hardware input sample rate 
into the appropriate location in the AIFF Common 
chunk.  When recordaiff receives a user interrupt, 
it writes all sample data
currently in the audio buffer out to disk before it
exits. 

Recordaifc supports CCITT G.722 4:1, CCITT G.711 
u-law 2:1, and Aware MultiRate compression for the 
AIFF-C file format.

Please see the man page for more details.


aifcinfo:    
--------

Parses an AIFF or AIFF-C file and prints out a 
detailed description of the audio data and header
information inside the file.

NOTE: The source file "aifcinfo" included here is no longer the
source code for the actual "aifcinfo" 
executable which is shipped in /usr/sbin. Starting with IRIX 6.2,
the "aifcinfo" command is a wrapper around the general-purpose
"dminfo" command. This wrapper translates from "dminfo" style output
to the older "aifcinfo" output format.  The source for the pre-6.2 
version of "aifcinfo" is still included here as an Audio File Library
programming example.

aiff2aifc, aifc2aiff, aifccompress, aifcdecompress:
---------------------------------------------------

These sample programs are all generated from the same
source file:   aifcconvert.c

NOTE: The source file "aifcconvert.c" included here is no longer the
source code for the actual "aiff2aifc", "aifc2aiff", "aifccompress", and
"aifcdecompress" executables which are shipped in /usr/sbin. Starting with
IRIX 6.2, these commands are implemented as wrappers around the general-purpose
"dmconvert" command. These wrappers translate between "dmconvert" command-line
arguments and output format and their native command-line arguments and
output formats. The source for the pre-6.2 version of "aifcconvert" is
still included here as an Audio File Library programming example.

aiff2aifc: 
    Converts an AIFF file to the newer AIFF-C standard
    format. Preserves all header and auxiliary information
    (strings, MIDI exclusive data, etc) during the conversion.

aifc2aiff:
    Converts an AIFF-C file to the older AIFF format.
    Preserves all header and auxiliary data chunks (strings,
    MIDI exclusive data, etc) common to both formats.

    Provides backward compatability for applications which
    do not support the newer AIFF-C format. Applications 
    linked with the SGI Audio File Library can automatically
    parse files in either format. 

aifccompress:
    Converts an AIFF-C file which contains uncompressed audio data to
    an AIFF-C file which contains compressed data. Nonaudio and 
    auxiliary header information is preserved.

    Compression algorithms supported by the SGI Audio File Library are:
    CCITT G.722 ADPCM, CCITT G.711 mu-law, CCITT G.722 A-law, and
    Aware MPEG and MultiRate algorithms.
    The SGI Audio File Library does not support Apple proprietary
    compression schemes. 

aifcdecompress:
    Converts an AIFF-C file which contains compressed audio data to
    an AIFF-C file which contains uncompressed data. Nonaudio and
    auxiliary header information is preserved.
