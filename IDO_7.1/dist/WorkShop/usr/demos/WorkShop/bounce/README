The files in this directory are from the book "Object-Oriented Programming
with C++ and OSF/Motif", by Doug Young, available from Prentice Hall early
1992.  The ISBN number is 0-13-630252-1.  All source is copyrighted by

The files in this directory implement a small application framework, called
MotifApp, and a program that shows a simple animation. The demo program,
"bounce", creates a "Stage" on which the user can place bouncing balls of
various colors.  The speed of the animation can be controlled with a
slider, and the animation can be started, stopped, and single stepped.

This directory has been re-organized to serve as a simple self-contained
collection of C++ classes to use for CASEVision/WorkShop demos. Normally, the
files that make the applciation framework would be built in a separate library
and linked with the files in the program. The "application framework" part
consists of the files:

	Actor.C
	Clock.C
	Cmd.C
	CmdInterface.C
	CmdList.C
	ColorChooser.C
	ColorModel.C
	ColorView.C
	DialogManager.C
	HSVView.C
	InfoDialogManager.C
	Main.C
	MainWindow.C
	MenuBar.C
	MenuWindow.C
	NoUndoCmd.C
	QuestionDialogManager.C
	QuitCmd.C
	RGBController.C
	RGBView.C
	SwatchView.C
	TextView.C
	UIComponent.C
	UndoCmd.C
	WarnNoUndoCmdC


The files that belong to the bounce program itself are:

	AddBallCmd.C
	BounceApp.C
	BounceClock.C
	BounceWindow.C
	BouncingBall.C
	ControlPanel.C
	RunCmd.C
	Stage.C
	StepCmd.C
	StopCmd.C


To build the program, just type "make". To run the demo, type "bounce". The
file Bounce.appdefaults contains some useful resource settings for the
program. You should install this as "Bounce" in your app-defaults directory
(usually /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults).

All code is preliminary, subject to change, and provided for purposes of
demonstration only. In particular, there will be minor differences between
the sources included here and the final form of the sources that appar in
the book.
