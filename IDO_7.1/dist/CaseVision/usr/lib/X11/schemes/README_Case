	When WorkShop 2.4 was installed on your system,
  you may have noticed a large number of new scheme names appearing
  under /usr/lib/X11/schemes.  These new schemes are named for
  places (e.g. Arizona) rather than the artist names (e.g. VanGogh)
  that you have currently.  The new schemes will not be
  supported until Irix 5.3 so please stick with using the just the
  artist names in your .Xdefaults file for now.  

	When you upgrade to 5.3, you will have the opportunity to
  use the new scheme browser in the toolchest to preview and specify 
  your scheme choice.  The 5.3 scheme browser will allow you to see 
  a small sample picture of each system scheme before selecting the 
  one you want for your entire desktop.  Before using the scheme 
  browser to set your scheme choice, remove the "*scheme: <name>" 
  setting from your .Xdefaults file so that the two mechanisms for
  setting your scheme preference don't clash.  If you are using
  an application that depends upon the old schemes and was not 
  re-released for 5.3, say tvquery for example, prefix the scheme 
  resource in your .Xdefaults file with the name of the application:

	tvquery*scheme: Rembrandt

  and the application will go on using the old schemes until a new
  version is released that plays with the new ones.

	In 5.3, only the place name schemes will be officially 
  supported; the artist name schemes will still exist for the sake of
  backward compatibility but they will not appear in the scheme browser.  
  Some of the more popular artist schemes have been incorporated 
  under new names into the official 5.3 scheme set.  The map between
  these old scheme names and the new names is as follows:

	Gainsborough	->	RedGreenSafe
	Leonardo	->	Bayou
	Monet		->	RoseGarden
	Print		->	GrayScale
	Rembrandt	->	Mendocino
	Turner		->	Potrero
	VanGogh		->	Buckingham
	Whistler	->	Gotham
	Willis		->	BlackAndWhite
