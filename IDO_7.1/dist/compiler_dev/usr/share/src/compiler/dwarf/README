This implementation of libdwarf is not complete.  Among the
missing features are consumer support for .debug_macinfo and
support for .debug_loc.  Many paths have not yet been tested.

The .ps files are postscript. So those who cannot deal with mm
format files but do have a postscript printer can print the
documents.

libdwarf2.1.ps documents a way for a debugger to read dwarf information.
libdwarf2p.1.ps documents a way for a compiler to generate dwarf information.
dwarf.v2.ps documents Dwarf Version 2.
index.v2.ps is an index to dwarf.v2.ps.
indexDW.v2  is a plain text index of dwarf #defines to dwarf.v2.ps

The commands used to generate the postscript were:
 pr -t -e libdwarf2.1.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >libdwarf2.1.ps
 pr -t -e  libdwarf2p.1.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >libdwarf2p.1.ps
 pic dwarf.v2.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >dwarf.v2.ps 2> newIndex
 pic index.v2.mm | tbl | psroff -t -mm >index.v2.ps

The index.v2.mm was generated by the dwarf-document writer
using some local ATT/USL tools:

To build libdwarf.a, type
	make -f Makefile.gifts

To use dwarf or libdwarf, you may want to install dwarf.h and
libdwarf.h somewhere convenient.
