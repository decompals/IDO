.SH NAME
\*LXmDragContext \*O\(em The DragContext widget class
.iX "XmDragContext"
.iX "widget class" "DragContext"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sS
.iS
\&#include <Xm/DragDrop.h>
.iE
.sE
.SH DESCRIPTION
DragContexts are special widgets used in drag and drop transactions.
A DragContext is implemented as a widget, but a client does not
explicitly create a DragContext widget.  Instead, a client initiates
a drag and drop transaction by calling \*LXmDragStart\*O, and this
routine initializes and returns a DragContext widget.  There is a
unique DragContext for each drag operation.  The toolkit frees a
DragContext when a transaction is complete; therefore, an application
programmer should not explicitly destroy a DragContext.
.PP
Initiator and receiver clients both use DragContexts to track
the state of a transaction.  When the initiator and receiver of
a transaction are in the same client, they share the same
DragContext instance.  If they are in different clients, there
are two separate DragContexts.  In this case, the initiator calls
\*LXmDragStart\*O and the toolkit provides a DragContext for the
receiver client.  The only resources pertinent to the receiver
are \*LXmNexportTargets\*O and \*LXmNnumExportTargets\*O.  These
can both be passed as arguments to the \*LXmDropSiteRetrieve\*O
function to obtain information about the current drop site.
.PP
In general, in order to receive data, a drop site must share at least
one target type and operation in common with a drag source.  The
DragContext resource, \*LXmNexportTargets\*O, identifies the selection
targets for the drag source.  These export targets are compared with the
\*LXmNimportTargets\*O resource list specified by a drop site.
The DragContext resource, \*LXmNdragOperations\*O, identifies the
valid operations that can be applied to the source data by the
initiator.  The drop site counterpart resource is
\*LXmNdropSiteOperations\*O, which indicates a drop site's supported
operations.
.PP
A client uses DragIcon widgets to define the drag-over animation
effects associated with a given drag and drop transaction. 
An initiator specifies a set of drag icons, selects a blending
model, and sets foreground and background cursor colors with
DragContext resources.
.PP
The type of drag-over visual used to represent a drag operation
depends on the drag protocol style.  In preregister mode, the server
is grabbed, and either a cursor or a pixmap may be used as a drag-over
visual.  In dynamic mode, drag-over visuals must be implemented
with the X cursor.  If the resulting drag protocol style is
Drop Only or None and the \*LXmNdragInitiatorProtocolStyle\*O is 
\*LXmDRAG_DYNAMIC\*O or \*LXmDRAG_PREFER_DYNAMIC\*O,  
then a dynamic visual style (cursor) is used.  Otherwise, a preregister
visual style is used.
.SS "Classes"
DragContext inherits behavior and resources from \*LCore\*O.
.PP
The class pointer is \*LxmDragContextClass\*O.
.PP
The class name is \*LXmDragContext\*O.
.SS "New Resources"
The following table defines a set of widget resources used by the
programmer to specify data.  The programmer can also set the
resource values for the inherited classes to set attributes for
this widget.  To reference a resource by name or by class in
a .Xdefaults file, remove the \*LXmN\*O or \*LXmC\*O prefix and use
the remaining letters.  To specify one of the defined values for a
resource in a .Xdefaults file, remove the \*LXm\*O prefix and use
the remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but include
any underscores between words).  The codes in the access column
indicate if the given resource can be set at creation time (\*LC\*O),
set by using \*LXtSetValues\*O (\*LS\*O), retrieved by using
\*LXtGetValues\*O (\*LG\*O), or is not applicable (\*LN/A\*O).

when it is invoked.
.LI "\*LXmNconvertProc\*O"

client.
The \*Vwidget\*O argument passed to this procedure is the DragContext
widget.
The selection atom passed is _MOTIF_DROP.
If \*LXmNincremental\*O is False, the procedure should ignore the
\*Vmax_length\*O, \*Vclient_data\*O, and \*Vrequest_id\*O arguments and
should handle the conversion atomically.
Data returned by \*LXmNconvertProc\*O must be allocated using
\*LXtMalloc\*O and will be freed automatically by the toolkit after the
transfer.
For additional information on selection conversion procedures, see \*EX
Toolkit Intrinsics\(emC Language Interface\*O.
.LI "\*LXmNcursorBackground\*O"
Specifies the background pixel value of the cursor.
.LI "\*LXmNcursorForeground\*O"

The value \*LXmDROP_NOOP\*O for this resource indicates that no
operations are valid.
For Text and TextField widgets, this resource is set to
\*LXmDROP_COPY\*O | \*LXmDROP_MOVE\*O; for List widgets, it is set to
\*LXmDROP_COPY\*O.

Specifies the list of callbacks that are invoked when the drop
is completed.   The type of the structure whose address is passed to

can be converted to.
.LI "\*LXmNincremental\*O"
Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the transfer on the
initiator side uses the Xt incremental selection transfer mechanism
described in \*EX Toolkit Intrinsics\(emC Language Interface\*O.
If the value is True, the initiator uses incremental transfer; if the
value is False, the initiator uses atomic transfer.
.LI "\*LXmNinvalidCursorForeground\*O"

.PP
If the toolkit has just called a DropSite's \*LXmNdragProc\*O, the
toolkit initializes \*Voperation\*O to the value of the \*Voperation\*O
member of the \*LXmDragProcCallbackStruct\*O at the time the DropSite's
\*LXmNdragProc\*O returns.
.PP
If the toolkit has not called an \*LXmNdragProc\*O and the pointer is

selecting an operation from the bitwise AND of the initial value of the
\*Voperations\*O member and the value of the DropSite's
\*LXmNdropSiteOperations\*O resource.
The toolkit searches this set first for \*LXmDROP_MOVE\*O, then for
\*LXmDROP_COPY\*O, then for \*LXmDROP_LINK\*O, and initializes
\*Voperation\*O to the first operation it finds in the set.
If the toolkit finds none of these operations in the set, it initializes
\*Voperation\*O to \*LXmDROP_NOOP\*O.

\*LXmNdragOperations\*O resource.
.PP
If the toolkit has not called an \*LXmNdragProc\*O and the user does
select an operation, the toolkit initializes \*Voperations\*O to the
