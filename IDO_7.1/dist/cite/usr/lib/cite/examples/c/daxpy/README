When you try to annotate the innerloops in the two subroutines, you
will see that the first loop gets software pipelined and scheduled
in much fewer cycles than the second one. 

The reason for this is potential aliasing that could occur between the
parameters in the second subroutine. Therefore the scheduler has no way of
moving the loads and stores. In the second loop you will see code
sequences of the form 
  ld
  ld
  madd
  st
  ld
  ld
  madd
  st
etc.
