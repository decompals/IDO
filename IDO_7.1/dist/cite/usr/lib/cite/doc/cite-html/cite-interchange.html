<H1>Loop Level Information through CITE</H1>

<P>
In this section we will use a simple program to show the kinds of things
that are possible from within CITE. Think of it as a short tutorial on
using CITE.
</P>

<P>
Consider the following program (it has been loaded into
XEmacs/CITE).  It has two loop nests. As written the <I>first loop nest</I> 
suffers from performance problems. Any guesses why?

<P>
Remember that fortran arrays are stored in memory in column major
order.  So what does that mean? Each iteration of the inner loop (<tt>
'j' </tt> loop) might result in a cache miss for the array reference
<tt> a(i,j) </tt>.  So this loop nest has <B> poor cache
performance</B>.  The <I>second loop nest</I> is in the <B>correct
order</B> and achieves <B>better cache performance</B>. 
</P>

<P>
Since MIPS Pro Compiler is a cache aware compiler it will automatically interchange
the loops in the first loop nest we will see from CITE
