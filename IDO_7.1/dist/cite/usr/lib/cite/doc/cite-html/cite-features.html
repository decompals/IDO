<H1><A NAME=CITE> Features of CITE</A></H1>
<P>

The following is a list of the high-level features of CITE:
<OL>
<LI> A lightweight browser for loop level compiler information from the loop
nest optimizer, the software pipeliner, and other portions of the
code generator.
<LI> Context sensitive toolbars (each cite toolbar is buffer local), so
for example you could be using the "Annotate Toolbar" for one file and
using the "View Toolbar" for another.
<LI> Context sensitive menus (LNO menu, SWP menu etc) with flyby help.
<LI> Works for Fortran, C, and C++ (sometimes) languages.
<LI> Hooks into modes for Vi, so that both Emacs and Vi users can
be comfortable in it. 
<LI> Generation of scripts for compilation as well as a convenient
graphical user-interface for controlling the compiler commmand line
options.
</OL>

Future List:
<OL>
<LI> Integrating hardware counter information with the compiler information.
<LI> Parallelization information.
<LI> An interactive transformation tool. CITE would know about all of the
directives/pragmas that users can put in their programs to achieve
desired transformations.
<LI> A browser for inlining information on functions when IPA is
run (there is a first cut implementation but it needs more work).
</OL>
