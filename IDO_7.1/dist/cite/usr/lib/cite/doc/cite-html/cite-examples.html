<P>
The easiest way to learn to use CITE is to check out the examples.
The fortran examples are kernels from several applications. Each of
the examples are in their own directory with a Makefile. The Makefiles
have examples of compiler options/flags that generate the necessary
files for CITE to use.
</P> 

<P> The examples are all located in
<tt>/usr/lib/cite/examples</tt>. Most of the examples at present are
fortran ones. There is a small daxpy C example. In future there will
be more C examples and some C++ ones as well.
</P>

<P> The interchange and matrix multiply examples that were used earlier
are both there in the <tt>/usr/lib/cite/examples/{interchange,mm}</tt>
directories. </P>

<P>
For some examples of how inlining (using IPA) affects the choice of
inner loops, check out the <tt>/usr/lib/cite/examples/inlining-btrix</tt>
example.
