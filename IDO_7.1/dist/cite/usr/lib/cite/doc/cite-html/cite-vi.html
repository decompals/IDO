<H1> The Vi or Emacs dilema</H1>
<HR>

<P>
Much of XEmacs is mouse/menu driven so switching to it should be
fairly easy. But if you are a Vi diehard there is still hope so read on!
</P>

<P>
After you load CITE and bring up a source file a button -- "Vi Mode"
-- appears in the menubar (right in the middle) and clicking on it
takes you to Vi Emulation and changes the button to be "Emacs Mode"
allowing you to toggle back and forth between Vi mode and Emacs.
</P>

<P> The package used for Vi emulation is called Viper. You should read
a little bit about viper. You can do this by starting up xemacs and
clicking on the <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="info.gif" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="36" ALT="info"> 
info icon in the toolbar. 
</P>

<P>
You will then get a new window. Use the scrollbar to go right to the
end. Select Viper by clicking on it using the left mouse. The new
window has a seperate toolbar that you can use for navigating through
the info buffers.
