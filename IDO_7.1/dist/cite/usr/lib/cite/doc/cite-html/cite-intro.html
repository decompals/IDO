<H1><A NAME=CITE> Introduction to the CITE (Compiler Information Through Emacs) prototype</A></H1>
<HR>

<P>
CITE is a package that works inside XEmacs to present detailed compiler
information from the MIPS Pro compiler at the level of the source program.
It is mostly meant to be used to understand how the program maps
on to the machine -- in essence the program performance -- by providing
access to information from the optimizations performed by the compiler. 
</P>

<P>
It uses the familiar metaphor of hypertext that all of us use in World
Wide Web browsers. It also uses context sensitive toolbars, context
sensitive menus, flyby help to facilitate convenient access to compiler
information.  </P>

<P> 
CITE works by reading information produced by the MIPS Pro compiler in
the listing, trace, and assembly files. It then creates extents --
regions in the XEmacs text buffer -- and adds the information that it
reads as properties of the extents. These extents are set to respond
to key and mouse events that would enable users to query the compiler
information within these extents. These extents are also highlighted
-- for example loops are highlighted/hypertexted as well as colored to
show which loop was picked to be the inner most loop -- to enable
users to know where to look for information.
</P>

<P>
CITE also enables users to understand the interplay between optimizations.
For example, what is the effect of high-level loop transformations on inner 
loop optimizations such as software pipelining. Or how does inlining enable
high-level loop transformations.
</P>

<P>
CITE is a free package that any user of the MIPS Pro compiler interested 
in understanding the performance of their program can get.
