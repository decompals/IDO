<P>
In CITE there are several ways of annotating loop nests. The most
convenient is using the Annotate/Hypertext toolbar. Clicking on the
Annotate/Hypertext toolbar button brings up a new toolbar on the right
as the following figure suggests. Clicking on the toolbar button
"Original Loop Nests" would cause CITE to annotate and hypertext the
loopnests in the source.

After we annotate the loop nests we get the following. What does
this mean?  The loop that LNO picks to be the innermost loop is
highlighted in cyan and rest of the loops are highlighted in yellow.
So in the first loop nest we see that LNO has
<B>interchanged</B> the two loops to improve locality. It has left
the 2nd loop nest in the same order as it was in the source.
