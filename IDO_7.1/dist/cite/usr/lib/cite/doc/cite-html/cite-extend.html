<P>
All of the sources for CITE (written in Emacs Lisp) is available in 
<tt> /usr/lib/cite/xemacs-elisp </tt>. You could extend CITE by
adding or modifying the sources.
</P>

<P>
For example here is a small program I wrote that runs after CITE
has annotated the post LNO loops. It generates a report that contains
the various loops as well as the number of cycles each loop is estimated
to take. Loops that did not software pipeline have a "*" at the end.

(defvar my-own-info '())

(defun obtain-cycles (string)
  (string-match "[0-9]+\\s-+cycles" string)
  (let ((m (match-data)))
    (substring string (first m) (second m))))

(defun is-swps (string)
  (if (null (string-match "#<swps>" string))
      "*"
    ""))

(defun collect-into-my-own-info ()
  (interactive)
  (setq my-own-info '())
  (let ((e (next-extent nil))
	(n nil))
    (while (not (null e))
      (let ((prop (extent-property e 'cg-loop-note)))
	(setq n (next-extent e))
	(if prop
	    (setq my-own-info 
		  (cons (list (extent-string e)
			      (obtain-cycles prop)
			      (is-swps prop)
			my-own-info)))))
	(setq e n))))

(defun script-out ()
  (interactive)
  (mapcar (function 
  	    (lambda (x)
	      (princ (first x))
	      (princ "   ")
	      (princ (second x))
	      (princ "   ")
	      (princ (third x))
	      (princ "\n"))) (reverse my-own-info)))

<P>
First put this in a file or an emacs buffer and evaluate it. 
After that in the post LNO buffer first do an 
<tt> M-x collect-into-my-own-info </tt> to collect all of the CG information
into the list <tt> my-own-info </tt>. Next evaluate <tt> (script-out) </tt>
in the <tt> *scratch* </tt> buffer.  This should produce an output of
the form (this example is from an industry code called Abacus in which one
of the big loops gets fissioned into 15 smaller loops and that hurts 
performance). We wanted to get details on each of the 15 smaller loops
as well as see which ones got software pipelined.
