<HR>

The following are some of the known problems. There might be other bugs, if
you encounter any please email them to <A HREF="mailto:ssuresh@mti.sgi.com">ssuresh@mti.sgi.com</A>.

<LI> When LNO does not do optimization on a loop, it could be due to 
several problems. One of them is dependence problems. CITE does not
print out the details. In other case LNO might not optimize because of
a scalar that it couldnt expand. The name of the scalar comes out wrong.

<LI> CITE uses several heuristics to correlate the information produced
by the code generator to the post LNO loop structure. If the code generator
fails to produce the relevant information, the correlation will be wrong
sometimes. I have seen examples of this for DO WHILE loops.

<LI> Sometimes reverse if conversion destroys failure notes from the
software pipeliner. There might be no information on the reason the inner
loop did not software pipeline.
