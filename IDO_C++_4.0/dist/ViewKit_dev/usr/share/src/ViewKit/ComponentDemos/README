This directory contains demos of some of the pre-existing viewkit
components. The examples are:

read from stdin. The input is expected to consist of lines of the
form:

names should be unique, but labels do not need to be. For example, one
could input:

1 2 one two
1 3 one three
3 4 three four

Displays a simple checkbox, demoing the VkCheckBox component.

=========

complete <directory>

resizer
=========

Demonstrates the VkResizer component, whcih allows users to
iteractively resize a widget.

modified
=========

the contents of the text field displays a "dog-ear" in the upper right
corner. Clicking on this dog-ear reverts the text field to its former
value.
