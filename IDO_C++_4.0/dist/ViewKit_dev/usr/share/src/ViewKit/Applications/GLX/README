This directory builds Rotate, a sample application that uses GLX to do
GL rendering in an X window.

VkGLX is a ViewKit component which creates a GlxMDraw widget for GL
rendering.  Virtual methods provide hooks for the application for
graphics initialization (ginit), exposure of the component (expose),
resize of the component (resize), and keyboard/pointer events (input).

Box is a subclass of VkGLX which draws a 3D box and rotates it when
the user presses one of the three mouse buttons.

The GL source to draw the box and rotate it were taken from the
GlxMDraw widget demo installed as:

  /usr/people/4Dgifts/examples/GLX/glxwidget/demos/mscrn_rotate.c

from the 4Dgifts/src/basicw subsystem.
