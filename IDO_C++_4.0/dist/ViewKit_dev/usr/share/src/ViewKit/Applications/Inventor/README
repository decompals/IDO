This directory builds IvClock, a ViewKit implementation of
the Inventor clock sample program from Inventor 2.0.

VkInventorApp is a very simple subclass of VkApp which initializes
Inventor at creation time.

Clock is a ViewKit component which models the scene using Inventor.
The modeling source and datafile was taken from the Inventor demo
installed as:

  /usr/share/src/Inventor/samples/clock/ivclock.c++

from the inventor_dev.src.sample subsystem.
