This directory contains small programs that demonstrate some basic
features of the the ViewKit, displaying windows, handling command line
options, interacting with the window manager, and so on. The examples
are:

generic
=======

The simplest possible ViewKit application. Just displays an empty
window. 

generic2
=========

Extends the generic example by adding a menu pane to the window.

hello
======

The basic "hello world" program, viewkit style. This example
demonstrates subclassing from VkSimpleWindow.


callback
=========

Demonstrates how to use Xt-style callbacks with ViewKit and C++.


cmdline
========

Show how to use the Xt-style command-line argument mechanism to set a
resource from the command line.


cmdline2
==========

Extends the above example by retrieving the value of a resource and
placing it in a class data member.

busy
=====

Demonstrates the use of the "busy()" and "notBusy()" functions.

stopwatch
==========

A simple "stopwatch" program that demonstrates a more complex widget
tree in a ViewKit window. This example also show some other viewkit
facilties, including the VkPeriodic class, which provides a simple
interface to XtAppAddTimeout, and also uses the XmGrid widget. This
example also uses a viewkit-style C++ member function callback to
interface with the timer.
