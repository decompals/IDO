This directory contains examples that demonstrate the ViewKit support
for tooltalk messages between applications. The examples are:

sample1
=======

This simple program displays two scale widgets.  The user can select a
value on the one labeled sender. A button can be used to broadcast a
"notice" of the new value. The program also recieves such notices and
updates the "reciever" slider accordinly. You can run multiple
instances of the program, and all will send and recieve notices.


sample2_client, sample2_service
=================================

These two program work together to simulate an application that
requests a service of another. Sample2_client appears the same as
sample1, but sends a request to sample2_service. The program
sample2_service increments the value in the request and sends back a
reply to the client, which then updates it's recieved slider.

NOTE: You must have the tooltalk library libtt.a to compile these
examples.
