For two function types to be compatible, both shall specify compatible
return types.  Moreover, the parameter type lists, if both are present,
shall agree in the number of parameters and in use of the ellipsis
terminator; corresponding parameters shall have compatible types.  If
one type has a parameter type list and the other type is specified by
a function declarator that is not part of a function definition and
contains an empty identifier list, the parameter list shall not have
an ellipsis terminator and the type of each parameter shall be
compatible with they type that results from application of the default
argument promotions.  If one type has a parameter type list and the
other is specified by a function definition that contains a (possibly
empty) identifier list, both shall agree in the number of parameters,
and the type of each prototype parameter shall be compatible with the
type that results from application of the default argument promotions
to the type of the corresponding identifier.  (For each parameter
declared with function or array type, its type for these comparisons
is the one that results from conversion to a pointer type.  For each
parameter declared with qualified type, its type for these comparisons
is the unqualified version of its declared type.)  There you have it!

compatible with the type that results from application of the default
argument promotions.
3.5.4.3(15)
prototype declaration and non-prototype definition found for %s, the type of this parameter is not compatible with the type after applying default argument promotion

prototype parameter shall be compatible with the type that results
from application of the default argument promotions to the type of the
corresponding identifier.

Internal error in parameters to function substr; loc: '%s'; len: '%s'.
Internal error in parameters to function insertstr; indx: '%s'.
Internal error in function get_tag_name; input is a non-tagged type.
Internal error in function gen_type_str -- not a type tree '%s'
Cannot open file '%s'
Prototype should be moved after tag or a typedef declaration.
Please look for comments in the extracted header file.
The extracted header file includes prototypes for static functions,
which should be removed, if you wish to include the header in a source file
other than the originator.
ANSI C requires formal parameter before "..."
This extension is meant to be used for compatibility with varargs.h
3.5.4.3(35)
syntax error: "&..." invalid
extension used to access "..." formal arguments.
function '%s' initialized like a variable
The type of entity to be initialized shall be an object type or an
array of unknown size.
3.5.7(31)
initializer not an array aggregate
The initializer for an object that has aggregate type shall be a
brace-enclosed list of initializers for the members of the aggregate,
written in increasing subscript or member order.
3.5.7(20)
'%s' type is incomplete; cannot initialize
Was the struct ever defined?
3.5.7.(31)
'%s' is not standard ANSI.
This keyword/type is not defined in strict ANSI mode.
3.1.1
not a legal asm string
The first operand of an asm string should be, after argument substitution,
a legal assembly string.
The -float option will be ignored in ANSI mode.
The -float option is ignored, since otherwise program semantics would
violate the ANSI standard.  In particular, fp constants are always
'double' with ANSI-C, while with -float the type of fp constants will
depend on the context and may be 'float'.
ANSI C support unavailable with C compiler bundled with RISC/os
The C compiler bundled with RISC/os does not support ANSI C.  ANSI
C support requires a separate license.
Ignored invalid warning number(s) in -woff option, %s%s !
Warning numbers must be in the range %s to %s.
The set of warning numbers in cfe is disjoint from the set of warning numbers
in accom, since accom warnings cannot be mapped one-to-one to cfe warnings.
'%s' not handled as an intrinsic due to incompatible argument types .
'__unalign' only qualifies pointers
'__unalign' indicates the object pointed at by pointer is unaligned (e.g.,
int * __unalign p).  This is an extension to ANSI C and like 'volatile'
and 'const' can follow the '*' in pointer declarations, but unlike both
cannot qualify a base type.
index expression is an anachronism
ANSI C++ doesn't support array index expressions in delete.
5.3.4
member cannot be of function or incomplete type.
3.5.2.1(12)
Illegal lint option, '%s', is ignored.
cannot open header message buffer file
cannot write header message buffer file
cannot read header message buffer file
cannot seek in header message buffer file
struct/union/enum '%s' is used, but not defined
static '%s' unused
nonportable character comparison (chars may be signed or unsigned)
redundant comparison of unsigned with constant expression
redundant statement, control flow cannot reach this statement
'%s' may be used before set
function parameter '%s' is not used in function '%s'
'%s' is not used in function '%s'
'%s' set but unused in function '%s'
control may fall through %s statement
function '%s' has return(e); and return;
function '%s' may return random value to place of invocation %s
label without goto: '%s'
width of %s constant is smaller than size of type (%s)
explicit conversion from '%s' to '%s' %s
implicit conversion from '%s' to '%s' %s
'%s' may be indistinguishable from '%s' due to internal name truncation
Promoted formal parameter and promoted argument have incompatible types
No prototype for the definition of '%s' %s
       (as included in %s)
==============
unsupported language linkage
string-literal specifies an unsupported linkage
7.4(1)
No prototype for the call to %s
To achieve better type-checking, there should be a full prototype for
the function being called.
3.5.4.3
'inline' only applies to function declarations
leave statment can occur only within try body
Microsoft extension
Use of a Microsoft extension detected without usage of the
compiler option -msft.
No parameter mentioned
A file with no declarations or definitions is accepted as an extension to ANSI C
The translation unit must contain at least one external definition.
3.7
Incompatible signed and unsigned version of a type
Yacc initialization error
Internal error: yacc cannot initialize itself.
The option %s may not be supported in future releases; please contact SGI.
We suggest that you not use this option.
Incompatible char and unsigned char versions of a type
Lshift with undefined behaviour.
Lshift with a negative right operand, or a right operand that is greater 
than or equal to the width in bits of the promoted left operand, results 
in undefined behaviour.
