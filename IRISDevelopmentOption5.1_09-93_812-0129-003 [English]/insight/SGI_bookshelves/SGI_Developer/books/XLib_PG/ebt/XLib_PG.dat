interface to Version 11 of the X Window System.  The X library,
known as Xlib, is the lowest level of programming interface to
X.  This library enables a programmer to write applications
with an advanced user interface based on windows on the screen,
with complete network transparency, that will run without changes
on many types of workstations and personal computers.Xlib is powerful enough to write effective applications without
additional programming tools and is necessary for certain tasks
even in applications written with higher-level "toolkits."There are a number of these toolkits for X programming, the most
notable being the DEC/MIT toolkit Xt, the Andrew toolkit developed
by IBM and Carnegie-Mellon University, and the InterViews toolkit
from Stanford.  These toolkits are still evolving, and only Xt is
currently part of the X standard.  Toolkits simplify the process of
application writing considerably, providing a number of widgets
that implement menus, command buttons, and other common features of
the user interface.This manual does not describe Xt or any other toolkit.
ID="IX-1002-CH00-1"X libraryID="IX-1002-CH00-2"Xt Toolkit
That is done in Volumes Four and Five of our X Window System
series.
Nonetheless, much of the material described in this book
is helpful for understanding and using the toolkits, since the
toolkits themselves are written using Xlib and allow Xlib code to
be intermingled with toolkit code.ID="S1-1002-CH00-2"Summary of ContentsThis manual is divided into two volumes.  This is the first
volume, the Xlib Programming Manual.  It provides a
conceptual introduction to Xlib,  including tutorial material
and numerous programming examples.  Arranged by task or topic,
each chapter brings together a group of Xlib functions, describes
the conceptual foundation they are based on, and illustrates how
they are most often used in writing applications (or, in the case
of the last chapter, in writing window managers).  Volume One is
structured so as to be useful as a tutorial and also
as a task-oriented reference.The second volume, the Xlib Reference Manual, includes
reference pages for each of the Xlib functions, organized
alphabetically for ease of reference; a permuted index; and
numerous appendices and quick reference aids.Volume One and Volume Two are designed to be used together.
To get the most out of the examples in Volume One, you will
need the exact calling sequences of each function from Volume Two.
To understand fully how to use each of the functions described
in Volume Two, all but the most experienced X "hacker"will need the explanation and examples in Volume One.Both volumes include material from the original Xlib and X11
protocol documentation provided by MIT, as well as from other
documents provided on the MIT release tape.  We have done our
best to incorporate all of the useful information from the MIT
documentation, to correct code references we found to be in error,
to reorganize and present it in a more useful form, and to supplement
it with conceptual material, tutorials, reference aids, and examples.
In other words, this manual is not only a replacement but is a
superset of the MIT documentation.Those of you familiar with the MIT documentation will
recognize that each reference page in Volume Two includes
the detailed description of the routine found in Gettys,
Newman, and Scheifler's Xlib-C Language X Interface,
plus, in many cases, additional text that clarifies ambiguities
and describes the context in which the routine would be used.
We have also added cross references to related reference pages
and to where additional information can be found in Volume One.ID="S1-1002-CH00-3"How to Use This ManualVolume One is intended as an introduction to all the basic
concepts of X programming and also as a useful reference for
many of the most common programming techniques. It is divided
into 14 chapters, which describe and demonstrate the
use of the X programming library, and numerous appendices.You will find it necessary to read at least Chapters 1, 2, and 3
before attempting to program with the X library.
Chapter 1, Introduction, provides a discussion of the
context in which X programs operate.  Chapter 2, X Concepts,
describes the conceptual foundations underlying X programming.
Chapter 3, Basic Window Program, presents a simple program.Chapters 4 through 9 (Window Attributes, The Graphics Context,
Drawing Graphics and Text, Color, Events, and
The Keyboard and Pointer) discuss various programming techniques
that are used in all X programs.  These chapters can be read as a
tutorial and consulted for reference later.Chapter 10, Internationalization, and Chapter 11,
Internationalized Text Input describe the Xlib features
for making an application usable in any language without
changes to the application binary.  These features were added
in Release 5.Chapter 12, Interclient Communication, is a description of
communication between applications and between applications and
the window manager, including properties and selections.  The
proposed conventions for interclient communication are presented
in Appendix L, Interclient Communcation Conventions,
of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual (as of the second printing).Chapter 13, Managing User Preferences, describes the facilities
provided for database management, parsing the command line, and
managing user preferences.  Xlib calls this the resource manager.
ID="IX-1002-CH00-3"resource managerChapter 14, A Complete Application, provides an example
of a complete application.  This chapter is especially useful
in demonstrating managing user preferences with the resource manager.Chapter 15, Other Programming Techniques, describes
programming techniques that will be useful to some but not
all programs.  It should be scanned for applicable techniques
and read in detail when needed for a particular project.Chapter 16, Window Management, describes what window
managers do and how they work.  This information should provide
a more complete knowledge of the variety of contexts in which
X applications may function.  It also describes the Xlib
functions that are intended primarily for window management.
A simple window manager program is described.Appendix A, Specifying Fonts, describes how the
programmer should specify default font names.Appendix B, X10 Compatibility, describes the routines
supported in X11 for compatibility with X Version 10.Appendix C, Writing Extensions to X, is a guide to writing
extensions to X.  This is for experienced X programmers only.
It is provided so that this manual can serve as a complete
replacement for the MIT Xlib documentation.Appendix D, The basecalc Application, presents the
complete code for basecalc, the complete application
described in Chapter 12, A Complete Application.Appendix E, Event Reference, describes each event type in a
reference page format.  Included is how to select the events, when
they are generated, the contents of the event structures, and notes
on how to use them.  This information is vital in using the numerous
events.Appendix F, The Xmu Library, describes the routines in this
miscellaneous utilities library that are useful in Xlib programming.
This library is not an X Consortium standard but is widely available.Appendix G, Sources of Additional Information, lists where to
get the X software, companies that offer training in X programming,
and descriptions of additional published books on the subject.Appendix H, Release Notes, describes the changes between
Releases 3, 4 and 5.  This manual describes Release 4 and Release 5.The Glossary gives you somewhere to turn should you run across
a term with which you are unfamiliar.  Some care has been taken to see
that all terms are defined where they are first used in the text, but
this assumes a sequential reading of the manual.Volume Two consists of a permuted index, reference pages to each
library function, and appendices that cover macros, structures,
function groups, events, fonts, colors, cursors, keysyms, and
errors.  Finally, Volume Two concludes with at-a-glance charts
that help in setting the graphics context (GC) and the window
attributes.  This volume should be consulted to obtain the
specifics of calling each Xlib function.ID="S1-1002-CH00-4"Getting the Example ProgramsThe example programs in this book are available electronically
in a number of ways: by ftp, ftpmail, bitftp, and uucp.
The cheapest, fastest, and easiest ways are listed first.  If
you read from the top down, the first one that works for you is
probably the best.  Use ftp if you are directly on the
Internet.  Use ftpmail if you are not on the Internet but can send
and receive electronic mail to internet sites (this includes
CompuServe users).  Use BITFTP if you send electronic mail via BITNET.
Use UUCP if none of the above works.ID="S2-1002-CH00-1"FTPTo use FTP, you need a machine with direct access to the
Internet.  A sample session is shown, with what you should type in
boldface.ID="SC-1002-CH00-1"%ftp ftp.uu.net

receive electronic mail to and from Internet sites.  This includes
most workstations that have an email connection to the outside
world, and CompuServe users.
You do not need to be directly on the Internet.
Here's how to do it.You send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  In the message body, give
the name of the anonymous ftp host and the ftp commands you want to
run.  The server will run anonymous ftp for you and mail the files
back to you.  To get a complete help file, send a
message with no subject and the single word "help" in the body.
The following is an example mail session that should get you
the examples.  This command sends you a listing of the files in the
selected directory, and the requested examples file.  The listing is
useful in case there's a later version of the examples you're
interested in.ID="SC-1002-CH00-5"%mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

IBM-compatible PCs and Apple Macintoshes.
The examples are available by UUCP via modem from UUNET; UUNET's
connect-time charges apply.You can get the examples from UUNET whether you have an account or
not.  If you or your company has an account with UUNET, you will have
a system with a direct UUCP connection to UUNET.  Find that system,
and type:ID="SC-1002-CH00-7"uucp uunet\!~/published/oreilly/xbook/xlib//xlibprgs3.tar.Z yourhost\!~/yourname/The backslashes can be omitted if you use the Bourne shell (sh)
instead of csh.  The file should appear some time later (up to a
day or more) in the directory
/usr/spool/uucppublic/yourname.
If you don't have an account but would like one so that you can
get electronic mail, then contact UUNET at 703-204-8000.If you don't have a UUNET account, you can set up a UUCP connection
to UUNET using the phone number 1-900-468-7727.  As of this writing,
the cost is 50 cents per minute.  The charges will appear on your
next telephone bill.  The login name is "uucp" with no password.
For example, an L.sys/Systems entry might look like:ID="SC-1002-CH00-8"   uunet Any ACU 19200 1-900-468-7727 ogin:--ogin: uucpYour entry may vary depending on your UUCP configuration.
If you have a PEP-capable modem, make sure s50=255s111=30 is set before
calling.It's a good idea to get the file /published/oreilly/xbook/xlib//ls-lR.Z
as a short test file containing the filenames and sizes
of all the files in the directory.Once you've got the desired file, follow the directions under FTP
to extract the files from the archive.ID="S1-1002-CH00-5"Compiling the Example ProgramsOnce you've got the examples and unpacked the archive as described
above, you're ready to compile them.  The easiest way is to
use imake, a program supplied with the X11 distribution that
generates proper Makefiles on a wide variety of systems.
imake uses configuration files called Imakefiles which are
included.  If you have imake, you should go
to the top-level directory containing the examples, and type:ID="SC-1002-CH00-9"% xmkmf
% make Makefiles
% makeAll the application-defaults files are in the main examples directory.
The application-defaults files are not automatically installed in
the system
application-defaults directory (usually
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults on UNIX systems).
(See Chapter 9, Resource Management and Type Conversion, for
details.)  If you have permission to
write to that directory, you can copy them there yourself.
Otherwise, you can set the XAPPLRESDIR environment
variable to the complete path of the directory where you installed
the examples.  The value of XAPPLRESDIR must end with a / (slash).
(Most of the examples will not function properly without the
application-defaults files.)ID="S1-1002-CH00-6"AssumptionsReaders should be proficient in the C programming language,
although examples are provided for infrequently used features
of the language that are necessary or useful when programming
with X.  In addition, general familiarity with the principles
of raster graphics will be helpful.ID="S1-1002-CH00-8"Related DocumentsThe C Programming Language by B. W. Kernighan and D. M.

The X Window System software and these documents were written
under the auspices of Project Athena at MIT.  In addition, this

presentation, which was given at the MIT X Conference in
January 1988, and from David Rosenthal's
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual.
I owe a great debt to the X Consortium policy allowing
others to build on their work.I would like to thank the people who helped this book come into
being.  It was Tim O'Reilly who originally sent me out on a contract
to write a manual for X Version 10 for a workstation manufacturer
and later to another company to write a manual for X Version 11,
from which this book began.  I have learned most of what I know
about computers and technical writing while working for Tim.
For this book, he acted as an editor, he helped me reorganize
several chapters, he worked on the
Color and Managing User Preferences chapters when
time was too short for me to do it, and he kept my spirits up
through this long project.  While I was concentrating on the
details, his eye was on the overall presentation, and his efforts
improved the book enormously.This book would not be as good (and we might still be working on it)
had it not been for Daniel Gilly.  Daniel was my production assistant
for critical periods in the project.  He dealt with formatting issues,
checked for consistent usage of terms and noticed irregularities in
content, and edited files from written corrections by me and by others.
His job was to take as much of the work off me as possible, and with
his technical skill and knowledge of UNIX, he did that very well.This manual has benefitted from the work and assistance of the entire
staff of O'Reilly and Associates, Inc.  Sue Willing was responsible
for graphics and design, and she proofed many drafts of the book;
Linda Mui tailored the troff macros to the design by Sue Willing and
myself and was invaluable in the final production process; John Strang
figured out the resource manager and wrote the original section on
that topic; Karen Cakebread edited a draft of the manual and
established some conventions for terms and format.  Peter Mui
executed the "at-a-glance" tables for the inside back cover; Tom
Scanlon entered
written edits and performed copy fitting; Donna Woonteiler wrote the
index of the book; Valerie Quercia, Tom Van Raalte, and Linda Walsh
all contributed in some small ways; and Cathy Brennan, Suzanne Van Hove,
and Jill Berlin fielded many calls from people interested in the X manual
and saved me all the time that would have taken.
Ruth Terry, Lenny Muellner, and Donna Woonteiler produced the
Second Edition, with graphics done by Chris Reilley.
Mike Sierra produced the Third Edition.  A special thanks to
everyone at O'Reilly and Associates for putting up with my habits of
printer and terminal hogging, lugging X books around, recycling paper,
and for generally being good at what they do and good-natured to boot.David Flanagan wrote much of the material on X11R5, which appeared
originally in his book Programmer's Supplement for Release 5.
I'm sincerely grateful to him for doing such a great job.I would also like to thank the people from other companies that
reviewed the book or otherwise made this project possible:  John
Posner, Barry Kingsbury, Jeff MacMann and Jeffrey Vroom of Stellar
Computer; Oliver Jones of
Apollo Computer; Sam Black, Jeff Graber, and Janet Egan of Masscomp;

Despite the efforts of the reviewers and everyone else, any errors that
remain are my own.-- Adrian NyeID="CH-1002-1-1" NUMBER="1"IntroductionIntroductionThis chapter gives the big picture:  what X is all about and some
fundamentals of how it works.  Everyone should look at this chapter,
though readers who are already familiar with X may only want to skim
it.In September 1987, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released
the first snapshot of what may well become one of the most significant
software technologies of the 1990s:  Version 11 of the X Window
System, commonly referred to as X11.  X11 may not change the world,
but it is likely to change the world of workstations.The X Window System is being adopted as a standard by nearly
every workstation manufacturer and should eventually replace
or be supported under their proprietary windowing systems.
Versions will also be available for personal computers and
supercomputers.For the first time, portable applications can be written for an
entire class of machines rather than for a single manufacturer's
equipment.  Programmers can write in a single graphics language and
expect their applications to work without significant modifications
on dozens of different computers.What's more, since X is a network-based windowing system,
applications can run in a network of systems from different vendors.
Programs can be run on a remote computer, and the results displayed
on a local workstation.  Proprietary networks have been around for
a while.  However, network cooperation of different computers
has been held up by the lack of a common applications language.
Now there is one.Vendors hope that X will lead to a software explosion similar
to the one that occurred in response to the PC standard on
microcomputers.ID="S1-1002-1-1"Versions of XID="IX-1002-1-1"versions of XID="IX-1002-1-2"Xversions ofX was developed jointly by MIT's Project Athena and Digital
Equipment Corporation, with contributions from many other
companies.  It was masterminded by Robert Scheifler and
colleagues at MIT, though it owes some debt to the "W"windowing package developed by Paul Asente at Stanford.ID="IX-1002-1-3"Xhistory ofID="IX-1002-1-4"history of X
There have been numerous research versions of X.  Version 10,
Release 4 (popularly known as X10.4), which was released in 1986,
became the basis for several commercial products.  Development of
most X10.4 products was curtailed, however,
when it became apparent
that Version 11 would not be compatible with it.  Version 11, Release 1
became available in September 1987, Release 2 in March 1988, Release 3
in February 1989, Release 4 in January 1990, and Release 5 in August
1991.Version 11 is a complete window programming package.  It offers
much more flexibility in the areas of supported display features,
window manager styles, and support for multiple screens and provides
better performance than X Version 10.  It is fully extensible.
But just as important, the X11 subroutine library (Xlib) is expected
to be stable for several years and to be at least a de facto
industry standard.  That means that programs written with this
library will not need major revisions because of software updates.
While there may be additions to this library, there will not be
incompatible changes to it.With X11 Release 2, control of X passed from MIT to the
X Consortium, an association of major computer manufacturers who plan
to support the X standard.  The Consortium was formed in January 1988
and includes virtually all large computer manufacturers.  Many software
houses and universities are associate members, who also have a voice
in controlling the standard and receive advance access to newly released
software.ID="S1-1002-1-2"X Window System ConceptsID="IX-1002-1-5"XconceptsThe X Window System is complex, but it is based on a few premises that
can be quickly understood.  This section describes these major concepts.ID="S2-1002-1-1"Displays and ScreensThe first and most obvious thing to note about X is that it is a
windowing system for bitmapped graphics displays.LINKEND="FN-1002-1-1"ID="FN-1002-1-1"In bitmapped graphics, each dot on the screen (called a pixel,
or picture element) corresponds to one or more bits in memory.
Programs modify the display simply by writing to display memory.
Bitmapped graphics are also referred to as raster graphics, since
most bitmapped displays use television-type scan line technology:  the
entire screen is continually refreshed by an electron beam scanning
across the face of the display tube one scan line, or raster, at a
time.  The term bitmapped graphics (or memory-mapped graphics) is
more general, since it also applies to other dot-oriented displays,
such as LCD screens.  We assume that you are familiar with the basic
principles of bitmapped graphics.
It supports color as well as monochrome and gray-scale displays.ID="IX-1002-1-6"displaydefinitionA slightly unusual feature is that a display is defined as a
workstation consisting of a keyboard, a pointing device such as a
mouse, and one or more screens.  LINKEND="FN-1002-1-2"Multiple screens can work
ID="FN-1002-1-2"As of Release 5, there is a standardized extension called the X
Input Extension that supports multiple input devices other than
keyboards or mice.
together, with mouse movement allowed to cross physical screen
boundaries.  As long as multiple screens are controlled by a single
user with a single keyboard and pointing device, they comprise only
a single display, as shown in Figure 1-1.ID="FG-1002-1-1"A display consisting of more than one screenFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.1.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-1-1"ID="S2-1002-1-2"The Server-Client ModelID="IX-1002-1-7"Xnetworking aspectsID="IX-1002-1-8"server-client modelThe next thing to note is that X is a network-oriented windowing
system.  An application need not be running on the same system that
actually supports the display.  While many applications can execute
locally on a workstation, other applications can execute on other machines, sending
requests across the network to a particular display and receiving
keyboard and pointer events from the system controlling the display.ID="IX-1002-1-9"networkssupported by XID="IX-1002-1-10"TCP/IPID="IX-1002-1-11"DECnet
At this point, only TCP/IP and DECnet networks are supported by the X
Consortium and most vendors, though that may change before long.ID="IX-1002-1-12"serversThe program that controls each display is known as a server.
At first, this usage of the term server may seem a little odd--when
you sit at a workstation, you tend to think of a server as something
across the network (such as a file or print server) rather than the
local program that controls your own display.  The thing to remember
is that your display is accessible to other systems across the network,
and for those systems, the code executing in your system does act as a
true display server.The server acts as an intermediary between user programs (called
clients or applications) running on either the local
or remote systems and the resources of the local system.  The
server (without extensions) performs the following tasks:MARK="BULLET"Allows access to the display by multiple clients.Interprets network messages from clients.Passes user input to the clients by sending network messages.Does two-dimensional drawing--graphics are performed by the display
server rather than by the client.Maintains complex data structures, including windows, cursors,
fonts, and "graphics contexts," as resources that can be
shared between clients and referred to simply by resource IDs.
Server-maintained resources reduce the amount of data that has
to be maintained by each client and the amount of data that has
to be transferred over the network.Since the X Window System makes the network transparent to clients,
these programs may connect to any display in the network if the host
they are running on has permission from the server that controls that
display.  In a network environment, it is common for a user to have
programs running on several different hosts in the network, all invoked
from and displaying their windows on a single screen, as shown in Figure 1-2.ID="FG-1002-1-2"Applications can run on any system across the networkFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.1.02.gif" ID="GC-1002-1-2"ID="IX-1002-1-13"distributed processing definitionIn practice, each user is sitting at a server and can start
applications locally to display on the local server or can
start applications on remote hosts for display on the local
server, if the remote hosts have permission to connect to the
local server.  All other users in the network are in a similar
situation--they can run applications on their own system or on
yours, but they will, for the most part, be displaying on their own
server. This use of the network is known as distributed processing.
Distributed processing helps solve the problem of unbalanced system
loads.  When one host machine is overloaded, the users of that
machine can arrange for some of their programs to run on other hosts.One extreme of this arrangement is the PC server or X terminal.
Because these single-task systems can run only the X server (and
sometimes a window manager), a user
sitting at one of these servers must run all clients on systems
across the network, with their results displayed on the PC or X
terminal screen.  This makes the single-tasking PC or X terminal
look and work just like X on a multitasking workstation.ID="S2-1002-1-3"Window ManagementID="IX-1002-1-14"window managementintroduction toAnother important concept in X programming is that applications do not
actually control such things as where a window appears or what
size it is.  Given multiprocessor, multiclient access to the same
workstation display, clients must not be dependent on a particular
window configuration.  Instead, a client gives hints about
how long and where it would like to be displayed.  The screen
layout or appearance and the style of user interaction with the
system are left up to a separate program, called the
window manager.The window manager is just another program written with Xlib,
except that it is given special authority to control the layout of
windows on the screen.  The window manager typically allows the user
to move or resize windows, start new applications, and control the
stacking of windows on the screen, but only according to the window
manager's window layout policy.  A window layout policy is
ID="IX-1002-1-15"windowslayout policyID="IX-1002-1-16"layout policy
a set of rules that specify allowable sizes and positions of
windows and icons.ID="IX-1002-1-17"window managerrights ofID="IX-1002-1-18"window managerresponsibilities of
Unlike citizens, the window manager has rights but not responsibilities.
Programs must be prepared to cooperate with any type of window manager
or with none at all (there are fairly simple ways to prepare programs
for these contingencies).  The simple window manager
ID="IX-1002-1-19"twm window managertwm does not enforce any window layout policy, but clients should
still assume that there could be one.  For example, the window manager
must be informed of the desired size of a new window before the window
is displayed on the screen.  If the window manager does not accept
the desired window size and position, the program must be prepared to
accept a different size or position or be able to display a message
such as "Too small!"If you are having trouble visualizing this situation, imagine
a window manager where no windows are allowed to overlap.  This
is known as a tiled window manager.  The Siemens RTL
ID="IX-1002-1-20"RTL window managerID="IX-1002-1-21"Siemens RTL window managerID="IX-1002-1-22"tiled window manager
tiled window manager lets only transient windows (such as pop-up menus)
overlap.  The twm window manager, on the other hand,
ID="IX-1002-1-23"real-estate-driven
is referred to as real-estate-driven because keyboard input
is automatically assigned to whatever window the pointer currently
happens to be in.ID="IX-1002-1-24"listener window managerThere is at least one other window manager variety that you
will encounter, called a listener or click-to-type.
Its distinguishing feature is that it assigns all keyboard input
to a single window when that window is selected by clicking on it
with the pointer.  A listener may or may not allow windows to overlap.
Apple Macintosh‘ users will recognize this type of interface.
ID="IX-1002-1-25"tiled window managerX is somewhat unusual in that it does not mandate a particular type
of window manager.  Its developers have tried to make X itself as
free of window management or user interface policy as possible.
And, while the X11 distribution includes twm as a sample window
manager, individual manufacturers are
expected to write their own window managers and user interface guidelines.
In fact, two commercial window managers with user interface guidelines
are already becoming established.  They are olwm, the OPEN LOOK‘
window manager from AT&T and Sun, and mwm, the Motif‘ window
manager from Open Software Foundation.
The OSF Motif window manager mwm, and OPEN LOOK window manager
olwm both can be configured to be real-estate-driven or
click-to-type.In the long run, the developers of X may well have made the right
choice, in that the lack of clear user interface guidelines will allow
a period of experimentation in which the marketplace could come up
with better designs than are presently available.  Some industry
observers, however, decry this move, pointing out that it undercuts X's
appeal as a standard user platform--X programs may be portable
across systems from multiple vendors, but if users have to deal with a
different user interface on each system, half the benefit of that
portability will be lost.  Until a clear user interface standard
emerges from the marketplace, developers must be careful to write
their programs in such a way that they can run under different
window managers and user interface conventions.ID="S2-1002-1-4"EventsID="IX-1002-1-26"eventsdefinitionAs in any mouse-driven window system, an X client must be prepared
to respond to any of many different events.  Events include
user input (keypress, mouse click, or mouse movement) as well as
interaction with other programs.  (For example, if an obscured
portion of a window is exposed when another overlapping window is
moved, closed, or resized, the client must redraw it.)  Events of
many different types can occur at any time and in any order.  They
are placed on a queue in the order they occur and usually are
processed by clients in that order.  Event-driven programming
makes it natural to let the user tell the program what to do
instead of vice versa.The need to handle events is a major difference between programming
under a window system and traditional UNIX or PC programming.  X
programs do not use the standard C functions for getting characters,
and they do not poll for input.  Instead there are functions for
receiving events, and then the program must branch according to the
type of event and perform the appropriate response.
But unlike traditional programs, an
X program must be ready for any kind of event at any time.
In traditional programs the program is in control, asking for
certain types of input at certain times.  In X programs, the
user is in control most of the time.ID="S2-1002-1-5"Extensions to XID="IX-1002-1-27"Xextensions toThe final thing to know about X is that it is extensible.
The code includes a defined mechanism for incorporating extensions,
so that vendors are not forced to hack up the existing system in
incompatible ways when adding features.  These extensions are used
just like the core Xlib routines and perform at the same level.
Some extensions are standards of the MIT X Consortium, such as
the Shape extension, which supports non-rectangular windows, and
the X Input extension, which supports input devices other than
keyboard and mouse.  There is also a standard 3-D graphics extension called
PEX, with two APIs called PHIGS and PEXlib.  Other extensions are
under development.Extensions have both client-side and server-side code.  A
server vendor is not required to provide support for all the
standard extensions.  Therefore, before using an extension, you must
query the server to see if the extension is supported.
At this writing, only the Shape extension is widely supported.

Xlib provides functions for connecting to a particular display server,
creating windows, drawing graphics, responding to events, and so on.
Xlib calls are translated to protocol requests sent via tcp/ip either
to the local server or to another server across the network.  Some
of the many sample applications available on the X release include
xterm (a terminal emulator), xcalc (a calculator),
xmh (a mail handler), xclock (a clock), and a troff
previewer.ID="IX-1002-1-33"window managerdefinitionThe window manager is just another program written with the
X library, except that by convention it is given special authority
to control the layout of windows on the screen.Client is a slightly more general term than application,
ID="IX-1002-1-34"clientdefinition
although they are almost synonymous.  All clients except the window
manager are called applications.  When a statement in this manual
applies only to the window manager or only to the applications
managed by the window manager, the appropriate term is used.  In
other instances, whichever term seems more natural is used.Applications and window managers can be written solely with Xlib
or with a set of higher-level subroutine libraries known as
toolkits.  Toolkits implement a set of user interface features
ID="IX-1002-1-35"toolkitsdiscussion of
such as menus or command buttons (referred to generically as toolkit
widgets) and allow applications to manipulate these features
using object-oriented programming techniques.  Toolkit intrinsicsID="IX-1002-1-36"intrinsics
allow programmers to create new widgets.ID="IX-1002-1-37"toolkitslist ofThere are several toolkits distributed with the X11 release, the most
notable of them being the Xt Toolkit, which was developed by Digital
and MIT, and the Interviews toolkit, which was developed by Stanford
University.  Xt is now officially part of the X11 standard.Toolkits can make programming much, much easier and the finished
project more thorough.  Toolkits have built-in user configurability
and built-in code for interaction with the window manager, which will
save you a lot of trouble.  You are advised to use a toolkit for most
of your X programming.  However, all existing toolkits in C also require
or allow you to use Xlib code.  And, more than that, they use Xlib internally;
so understanding Xlib will help you understand how the toolkits work.Another reason to use a toolkit is to take advantage of
established user interface conventions.  Several of these
are available, such as OSF's Motif and Sun's
OPEN LOOK.  If you use Xlib for all your X programming, either
you will have to reimplement one of the established conventions
such as OPEN LOOK or your program will be an oddball that will
not look or respond as people expect.There are tradeoffs in using toolkits, however.  One is that the
executable for a given program using a toolkit is considerably
larger than the equivalent program written using Xlib.  Another
is that the toolkits utilize highly abstract concepts and require
strict programming conventions because of their object-oriented
design.  These take time to learn.This manual describes how to write programs with Xlib.  Other volumes
in our X Window System series cover the toolkits.ID="S1-1002-1-4"Overview of XlibJust what does the X library contain?  Table 1-1 groups the

X was
designed to allow any style of user interface, and that requires
a very flexible set of routines.  But not all the routines are
necessary or intended for writing normal applications.  Many are
intended for window management or for other specialized purposes.A more detailed listing that provides the name and a brief

You should read this chapter even if you are the type of person who
likes to jump right into the code.  (If you are desperate, you can
skip ahead to Chapter 3 and return to this chapter when you get
confused.)  "An hour or so spent reading about the system in general
can save many hours of programming that leads to a dead end when the
approach turns out to be wrong."When learning a new programming language, many programmers
prefer to look at a few code samples and then begin programming
right away, looking up more information as they need it.  This
manual is organized so that most of it is useful both as a tutorial
and as a reference.  There are lots of code samples and fragments
in this manual to help the person who likes to read code more than
words.  Around the code they will find many of the concepts described
that are necessary for understanding that particular example.The "just-look-at-the-examples" approach works up to a point.  It
allows a sharp individual to get "something" running in a very short
time.  Eventually, however, programmers find that in order to get the
most out of a system--and sometimes even to get it do anything
useful--a lot of underlying issues must be understood.  In X,
there are a lot of interrelated concepts and assumptions that are
so basic that the programmer should know them cold.  An hour or so
spent reading about the system in general can save many hours of
programming that leads to a dead end when the approach turns out
to be wrong.This chapter describes those underlying issues and assumptions
that are so important to programming with Xlib.  It goes into
considerably more detail than the brief conceptual overview provided
in LINKEND="CH-1002-1-1"Chapter 1, "Introduction."
After reading this chapter, you will
be well prepared to understand the rest of this manual and will
have a sound idea of what is required to write an X application.
This chapter describes how Xlib works, including a description of
window concepts and characteristics, graphics, and events, and reviews
the issues that you will need to think about in order to program.ID="S1-1002-2-1"How Xlib WorksID="IX-1002-2-1"Xlibhow it worksLet's start by describing the problem that X was designed to
solve and then describe how it goes about solving it.First of all, X was designed to provide windows on bitmapped
terminals.  This has been done before but not in a way
designed to be easily portable to many different brands of
hardware, from PCs to supercomputers.  The code was designed
to stress easy portability, even between different operating
systems, but still to allow high performance.Second, X was designed to allow many different types of machines
to cooperate within a network.  This was one of the major
innovations in the X design.  There are several standard networking
protocols, but there was lacking a widely adopted standard for a
higher-level protocol specifying what should be sent over the network
to drive a window system.  The first thing that was determined about
X was the protocol used to communicate across the network.ID="IX-1002-2-2"user interfacelack of policyThird, the developers of X decided that it should not require
(or even imply) a particular style of user interface.  Practically
speaking, X would not have been adopted as a standard by many companies
if it had implied a user interface incompatible with their proprietary
window systems.  In addition, the developers of X felt that the issues
surrounding the design of a window-based user interface for X were
not sufficiently worked out at present.  An important design goal was
thus to make X "policy free."To accomplish these goals, the X Window System had to be designed from
the bottom up.  To work over a network, there had to be programs running
at both ends of the connection to send and receive the information and
to interpret it.  The end that controls the display and input devices
was named the server.  At the other end are clients--programs written
using Xlib to interface with the X protocol.  This is shown
in Figure 2-1.ID="FG-1002-2-1"Clients and serversFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.2.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-2-1"Actually, although this manual describes Xlib, the C language interface
ID="IX-1002-2-3"XLisp interface
to the X protocol, there is also a Lisp interface, and there are likely
to be others.  Any language binding that can generate and receive
X protocol requests can communicate with a server and be used with
the X Window System.  But, at present, Xlib is the most popular low-level
programming interface used with X, because C is so widely available.ID="S2-1002-2-1"The X ProtocolID="IX-1002-2-4"X protocolThe X protocol specifies what makes up each packet of information
that gets transferred between the server and Xlib in both
directions.  Even when the server and Xlib are running on the
same machine, the protocol is used for communication,
through some internal channel instead of the external network.
There are four types of packets that get transferred via the
protocol:  requests, replies, events, and errors.
ID="IX-1002-2-5"requestsdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-6"replydefinitionID="IX-1002-2-7"eventsdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-8"errorsdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-9"protocol requestsA protocol request is generated by Xlib and sent to the server.
A protocol request can carry a wide variety of information, such
as a specification for drawing a line or changing the color
value in a cell in a colormap or an inquiry about the current
size of a window.  Most Xlib routines generate protocol requests.
The exceptions are routines that only affect data structures local
to Xlib and do not affect the server (regions and the resource
manager are the primary examples of these exceptions).A protocol reply is sent from the server to Xlib in response to
certain requests.  Not all requests are answered by replies--only
the ones that request information.  Requests that specify drawing,
for example, do not generate replies.  When Xlib receives a reply,
it places the requested data into the arguments or returned value
of the Xlib routine that generated the request.  An Xlib routine that
requires a reply is called a round-trip request.  Round-trip
ID="IX-1002-2-10"round-trip requestID="IX-1002-2-11"requestsround-trip
requests have to be minimized in clients because they lower
performance when there are network delays.An event is sent from the server to Xlib and contains information
about a device action or about a side effect of a previous request.
The data contained in events is quite varied, because it is the
principal method by which clients get information.  Events are kept
in a queue in Xlib and can be read one at a time by the client.
The range of types of events that the server sends to a client is
specified by the client.ID="IX-1002-2-12"errorsevents andID="IX-1002-2-13"eventserrors and
An error tells the client that a previous request was invalid.
An error is like an event, but it is handled slightly differently
within Xlib.  Errors cannot be read by the Xlib calls that read
events.  Instead, errors are sent to an error-handling routine in
Xlib.  The default error handler simply prints a message and exits;
it can be replaced by a client-specific error-handling routine.ID="S2-1002-2-2"BufferingID="IX-1002-2-14" SPAN="START"bufferingID="IX-1002-2-15"queueID="IX-1002-2-16"networksefficiencyXlib saves up requests instead of sending them to the server
immediately, so that the client program can continue running
instead of waiting to gain access to the network after every
Xlib call.  This is possible because most Xlib calls do not
require immediate action by the server.  This grouping of
requests by the client before sending them over the network
also increases the performance of most networks, because it
makes the network transactions longer and less numerous,
reducing the total overhead involved.Xlib sends the buffer full of requests to the server under three
conditions.  The most common is when an application calls an Xlib
routine to wait for an event but no matching event is currently
available on Xlib's queue.  Since, in this case, the application
must wait for an appropriate event anyway, it makes sense to
flush the request buffer.  Second, Xlib calls that get information
from the server require a reply before the program can continue, and
therefore, the request buffer is sent and all the requests acted on
before the information is returned.  Third, the client would like to
be able to flush the request
buffer manually in situations where no user events and no calls
to query the server are expected.  One good example of this third
case is an animated game, where the display changes even when there
is no user input.Let's look at how this works in practice.
When the application starts up, all the
requests that create the initial appearance of the application
are queued up by Xlib.  Then the application goes into its
event loop and calls XNextEvent().  Since nothing has yet
been sent to the server, there are no windows and therefore no events
have yet been generated.  So XNextEvent() causes all the
requests to be sent to the server, displaying the application.
Meanwhile, the application is still waiting for the first user
input.  When the user moves the mouse or presses a button or key, the
server, sends the events to Xlib as soon
as the network allows--it does not queue them or group
them (except under rare conditions involving grabs discussed
in LINKEND="S1-1002-9-4"Section 9.4, "Grabbing the Keyboard and Pointer").  Normally, once an event arrives, the
application generates more requests to draw--for example,
highlighting the border of a button.  These stay queued in Xlib
until all the events that have already arrived have been processed.
Once the application arrives at XNextEvent() and no
more events are in the queue, the queued requests are sent to
the server and the process starts again.Using Xlib calls, the client can flush the connection in three

ways:  by calling a routine that requires an immediate reply (a
routine with Query, Fetch, or Get in its
name); by calling certain event-reading routines when no matching
event exists on Xlib's queue; or by calling the routines
XFlush or XSync().  LINKEND="FN-1002-2-1"ID="IX-1002-2-22"XFlushID="IX-1002-2-23"XSyncID="FN-1002-2-1"In this manual, whenever you see typewriter font (such as that
used for the routine XSync()), it means this word would be
typed verbatim into C code as a symbol, structure name, structure
member, or Xlib routine.  Italic typewriter font is used for dummy
arguments to Xlib routines, since they could be typed into code as
shown but are arbitrary.  The argument names used in this volume
are the same as the names used on the reference pages in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.
The first of these actions says to the server, "I need some information;
please act on these requests right away and then give me the information."The second says, "I'm waiting for a certain kind of event, so I'll check
if you already sent the event over to Xlib.  If not, please act on these
requests immediately, and then I'll be waiting for the event."  The last
one says, "I don't need any information from you now, but I need you to
act on these requests immediately."  Normally, the last method is not
used much because there are enough of the first two types of Xlib
calls in the client to make the transactions frequent enough.You should already know that Xlib maintains a queue of the events for each
server to which an application is connected, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Whenever events arrive from the server, they are queued until the
client reads them.

application programming and especially in debugging.  It means that
drawing requests will not appear in a window until the request buffer
is flushed.  It means that errors are not discovered by the server until
the requests arrive at the server and are processed, which happens only after
Xlib flushes the request buffer.  Once discovered, the error is reported
immediately to the client.  In other words, several Xlib routines may be
called before an error caused by an earlier routine is reported.  These
are two of the most visible examples of the effects of buffering.
See LINKEND="S2-1002-2-28"Section 2.6.3, "Debugging an X Application" for more details on how buffering affects
programming and debugging.
ID="IX-1002-2-26" SPAN="END"bufferingID="S2-1002-2-3"ResourcesID="IX-1002-2-27"resourcesdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-28" SPAN="START"resourcesX uses several techniques to reduce network traffic.  One major
technique is to have the server maintain complex abstractions
such as windows or fonts and have the client allocate an integer
ID number for each one as a nickname.  Each of these abstractions
is called a resource.  A resource can be a window, pixmap,
colormap, cursor, font, or graphics context (these will be
described in a moment).Whenever an operation is to be performed on a window (or any
other resource), the ID of the window is used in one argument
to the Xlib routine.  This means that instead of an entire
structure full of data being sent over the network
with an Xlib routine call, only a single integer that refers to
that structure need be sent.  Remember that since the client and
the server may be running on different machines, pointers cannot
be used to refer to structures.  The caveat of the resource
approach is that the client must query the server when it needs
information about resources, which, as mentioned above, leads to
network delays.  As it turns out, clients normally do not need to
query the server very often, and the resource abstraction greatly
simplifies programs.If any client knows the ID of a resource, that client can manipulate
that resource even if some other client created the resource.
That means that more than one client can draw into the same window,
although that is not often desirable.  More importantly, this
is how window managers are implemented--they can move and resize
application windows because they know the IDs.
ID="IX-1002-2-29"multiple processesID="IX-1002-2-30"processesmultipleBe warned that there is another use of the term "resource" in X
that pertains to the resource manager.  A resource in the context
ID="IX-1002-2-31"resource manager
of the resource manager is a user-preference specification that
controls user-customizable elements of an application.  Fortunately,
these two uses of the term resource apply to different
parts of X and therefore are not too difficult to keep separate.
One use applies to server-maintained data structures, and the other
to user customization of an application.
ID="IX-1002-2-32" SPAN="END"resourcesID="S2-1002-2-4"Properties and AtomsID="IX-1002-2-33"propertiesintroduction toThe developers of X needed a way to allow clients to communicate
arbitrary data with each other, and they came up with properties.
A property is a packet of information associated with
ID="IX-1002-2-34"propertiesdefinition
a window, made available to all the clients running under a
server.  Properties are used by clients to store information
that other clients might need or want to know and to read
that information when set by other clients.Properties have a string name and a numerical identifier called
an atom.  An atom is an ID that uniquely
ID="IX-1002-2-35"atomsdefinition
identifies a particular property.  Property name strings are
typically all upper case, with words separated by underscores,
such as "WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS".  Atoms are used to refer to
properties in routine calls so arbitrary-length property name
strings do not need to be sent over the network.  An application
gets the atom for a property by calling XInternAtom().
You specify the string name for the property as an argument to
XInternAtom(), and it returns the atom.  From this point
on, the application uses only the atom to refer to that property.
Every application that uses this procedure will get the same
atom for the same property name string, if it is
connected to the same server (that has not been reset).Some atoms, called predefined atoms, are defined when
the server initializes.  An application does not need to use
XInternAtom() to get these atoms.  Instead, these atoms
are available as symbolic constants beginning with XA_.
These atoms identify properties whose contents have a certain
meaning known by convention to all clients.  The properties
themselves do not have any contents until a client or the window
manager sets them.  Some of the properties described in this
manual have predefined atoms and others do not, for historical
reasons.  Where predefined atoms are available, such as
XA_WM_HINTS, we will use them in the text to refer to
the property.  For properties with no predefined atoms, we will
use the string property name such as WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS,
which does not begin with XA_ and is not in Courier typeface.
This tells you whether you will need to call XInternAtom()
before using the property.A group of related clients or an extension may define other
properties and atoms that will have a meaning known to all
the clients in the group or using the extension.Atoms for properties are analogous to the IDs used to refer to
server resources, except that both an atom and a window are
needed to uniquely identify a property.  The same atom would be
used to identify a property on one window as on another--only
the window is different in the calls to set or read this property
on two windows.  Only the type Atom is ever used in client
code; properties are the underlying data managed by the server.One of the most important uses of properties is to communicate
ID="IX-1002-2-36"communicationthrough properties
information from applications to the window manager and vice versa.
The application sets the standard properties on its top-level
window to specify the range of sizes it prefers for its top-level
window and other information.  These properties are called "standard"because they are the minimum set that an application should specify.
Properties also communicate the other way; for example, the window
manager specifies what sizes of icon pixmaps it prefers.For more information on properties and atoms, see LINKEND="S1-1002-12-1"Section 12.1, "Properties and Atoms."ID="S2-1002-2-5"The Window ManagerID="IX-1002-2-37"window managerdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-38"window managerauthority ofThe window manager is just another client written with Xlib, but
by convention, it is given special responsibilities.
It mediates competing demands for the physical resources of a
display, including screen space and the colormap.  Usually it
has a user interface to allow the user to move windows about
on the screen, resize them, and start new applications.Most window managers decorate the main windows of all applications
with a titlebar and various tools for iconifying and resizing the
application.  The window manager does this by creating a separate
window that fits behind the main window of each application.  It
is this separate window that has the decorations on it.  This is
important mainly because your application code does not need to handle
this drawing.  Figure 2-3 shows the titlebar added to an application
by twm, the standard window manager in the MIT distribution as of
ID="IX-1002-2-39"twm window manager
R4.ID="FG-1002-2-3"Titlebar added to applications by the twm window managerFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.2.03.gif" ID="GC-1002-2-3"Much of the communication between clients and the window manager
and vice versa occurs through properties (the rest occurring
through events).  Many of the properties are known as hintsID="IX-1002-2-40"hintsdefinition
because they may not necessarily be honored by the window manager,
even if one is running.  An application must be prepared for the
window manager to ignore, modify, or honor the preferences it
indicates through the window manager hints.  The properties
themselves do not have valid contents until applications or
the window manager set them.Quite a few of the features of Xlib (and the X
protocol) exist only to give the window manager the mechanism to
enforce its authority.  These are described
in Appendix L, Interclient Communcation Conventions,
of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual (as of the second printing).
They will not be needed by normal applications.ID="IX-1002-2-41"substructure redirectiondefinitionOne such feature is called substructure redirection.
Substructure refers to the size, position, and overlapping
order of the children of a window.  Redirection refers to
the requests by applications to change the configuration of these
windows being sent to the window manager for approval instead of
actually getting acted upon by the server.  Substructure redirection
allows a window manager to intercept any request by an application
to change the size, position, border width, or stacking order (known
collectively as the window configuration) of its top-level windows
on the screen.  Any application request to change the configuration
of its top-level window will be canceled, and instead an event will
be sent to the window manager indicating the arguments used in the
reconfiguration request.  The window manager can then decide what
size, position, and stacking order to grant the application, and
the window manager will reconfigure the window to those dimensions.
ID="IX-1002-2-42"temporary windowsavoiding redirection
For temporary windows such as pop-up menus and dialog boxes, the
substructure redirect feature can be turned off using a window attribute.Substructure redirection may seem obscure, but it has two significant
implications for applications.  The first is that the application
cannot assume that the configuration it specifies for a window will
actually be reflected in the window on the screen.  This is true
whether the configuration was set by creating the window or by
reconfiguring the window.  That means that the application must
always determine the new configuration of the window before drawing
into it.  It can do this by selecting a certain event type which
contains the window configuration.
ID="IX-1002-2-43"configurationredirection of requestsThe second important implication of substructure redirection concerns
the mapping of a top-level window.  Because the window manager can
intercept the mapping request, and it might take some time before the
window manager decides on a window configuration and maps the window
itself, an application cannot assume that the window is visible
immediately.  That means it cannot draw into the window immediately.
The application must wait until it receives an event indicating that
the window is visible before drawing into the window.Communicating with the window manager, and window management
in general, is a long story which we'll describe more fully
in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," and LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management," gives an example of a simple window
manager and describes communication with applications from
the window manager's perspective.ID="IX-1002-2-44"session managementMost window managers today also have the ability to start and
kill applications.  This is known a session management.  However,
they can usually start only xterm and a few other basic clients.
A true session manager can be a separate client.  It would be
able to start any client and control its command line arguments and
save the state of a whole group of clients (before the user logs out)
and later restore them to the same position on the screen (when the
user logs back in).  This level of capability is not yet available
(but people are working on it).  Each application supplies its command
line as a hint so that the window or session manager has enough
information to restart it in its current state.Now you should have an idea of how Xlib works.  Let's move on
to a description of windows.ID="S1-1002-2-2"What are X Windows?ID="IX-1002-2-45"windowsfeatures ofID="IX-1002-2-46"windowsdefinitionAn X server controls a bitmapped screen.  In order to make it easier
to view and control many different tasks at the same time, this screen
can be divided up into smaller areas called windows.  A window is a
rectangular area that works in several ways like a miniature screen.
Windows on the screen can be arranged so they all are visible or so
they cover each other completely or partially.  A window may be any size greater than zero.Each window (on a screen running X) can be involved in a different
activity, and the windows currently in use are placed so they are at
least partially visible.  The window manager lets you move a different
window to the top when necessary or rearrange the size and position
of the windows.What you may not have realized is that some of these windows,
such as the ones created by the mail handler xmh, are
made up of many layered windows of various sizes.  The scrollbars,
titlebar, command buttons, and other features of the user interface
are actually separate windows that provide information to the user
or allow for input providing convenient control, as shown in Figure 2-4.
There is more here than meets the eye.ID="FG-1002-2-4"The windows used to create an instance of the xmh applicationFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.2.04.gif" ID="GC-1002-2-4"ID="S2-1002-2-6"Window CharacteristicsLINKEND="FN-1002-2-2"ID="FN-1002-2-2"Do read this section even if you are already familiar with
windowing systems, to make sure you understand X's particular
implementation of windowing.ID="IX-1002-2-47" SPAN="START"windowscharacteristicsID="IX-1002-2-48"windowsconfigurationWhat are the characteristics of a window?  There are many.ID="IX-1002-2-49"windowsparentID="IX-1002-2-50"parentdefinition
First of all, a window always has a parent window, which is
assigned as the window is created.  Each window is contained within
the limits of its parent.  The window cannot display output in areas
outside itself and cannot receive input from the keyboard or the
pointer while the pointer is outside itself (unless a grab
or keyboard focus is in effect,
as described in Sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2).
ID="IX-1002-2-51"hierarchy of windowsID="IX-1002-2-52"windowshierarchy of
Every window fits in a hierarchy set up by its children, its parent,
its parent's parent, and so on.  The very first window, the only one
that has no parent, is called the root window and fills the entire
screen.  The root window is created by the X server as it starts up.Second, each window has its own coordinate system.  As shown
in Figure 2-5, the origin of a window is the top-left
corner of the window and the x and y coordinates increase to
the right and bottom.ID="IX-1002-2-53" SPAN="START"windowscoordinate systemIn the X Window System:MARK="BULLET"The horizontal axis is x, and the vertical axis is y.x and y are 0 at the upper-left corner inside the
border (if there is one) of the window currently in use.  This

subwindows are made from the origin.  When we say that a
point is relative to a window, this means that the
x and y coordinates of the point are measured from the
window's origin.ID="IX-1002-2-56"windowsspecifying sizeID="IX-1002-2-57"windowsIDID="IX-1002-2-58"ID (identifier)of resources
Each window is given a unique identifying number (ID) when it
is created.  All the routines that affect a particular window
use a window ID as an argument and act in this window environment,
so positions in the window are specified relative to the upper-left
corner inside the border.  It is not necessary to know the position
of a window to correctly locate subwindows or draw graphics within
the window.ID="IX-1002-2-59"windowscreating offset from parentID="IX-1002-2-60"child windowsmoving with parentID="IX-1002-2-61"offset from parent
For example, to create a window using XCreateWindow() or
XCreateSimpleWindow(), you supply an offset from the
upper-left corner of the parent to position the new window.
When the parent moves, the new window stays in the same
position relative to its parent.
ID="IX-1002-2-62" SPAN="END"windowscoordinate systemID="IX-1002-2-63"windowspositionThird, a window has a position, which locates its upper-left
corner relative to its parent's corner, a certain width and
height of usable pixels within the border, and a border width.
ID="IX-1002-2-64"borderswidth
These characteristics are shown in Figure 2-5.  By convention,
the window width and height do not include the border.  Since several
windows may have the same parent, a window must also have
ID="IX-1002-2-65"stacking orderdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-66"configurationdefinition
a stacking order among these windows to determine which will be
visible if they overlap.
These four characteristics are collectively
known as the window configuration because they affect the layout
of windows on the screen.ID="FG-1002-2-5"Elements of the window configurationFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.2.05.gif" ID="GC-1002-2-5"To summarize, the window configuration includes:MARK="BULLET"A window's width and height in pixels,
not including the border.A window's border.  It can vary in width;
zero makes the border invisible.A window's particular position on the screen, specified

with the same parent.The width, height, and position are collectively called the
window geometry.  Applications often allow users to
specify the geometry and border width of the window as a
command line argument or through the user defaults mechanism.ID="IX-1002-2-67"depthdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-68"visualsdefinition
Fourth, a window has characteristics referred to as depth
and visual, which together determine its color characteristics.
The depth is the number of bits available for each pixel to represent
color (or gray scales).  The visual represents the way pixel values
ID="IX-1002-2-69"gray scale display
are translated to produce color or monochrome output on the monitor.ID="IX-1002-2-70"windowsclass (not visual)ID="IX-1002-2-71"class (window)
Fifth, a window has a class of either InputOutput
or InputOnly.  As the names imply, InputOutput
windows may receive input and may be used to display output, and
InputOnly windows are used for input only.  There is no
such thing as an output-only window because certain types of input,
called events, are needed by all windows.ID="IX-1002-2-72"window attributesdefinitionSixth, a window has a set of attributes.  The window attributes
control many aspects of the appearance and response of the window:MARK="BULLET"What color or pattern is used for the border and background of
the window?How are partial window contents relocated during resizing?When are the contents of the window saved automatically as they
become covered and then exposed?Which event types are received, and which types are
thrown away (not passed on to ancestor windows)?Should this window be allowed to be displayed, moved, or resized
without notifying the window manager?Which colormap is used to interpret pixel values drawn in this window?Which cursor should be displayed when the pointer is in this window?This may seem like a dizzying array of variables, but in practice,
many of them default to reasonable values and can be safely ignored.
And the flexibility they provide makes the system much more powerful.
All of these window characteristics will be explained in more detail
later in this chapter, and most will be covered again later in the manual.But first, a little more detail is necessary on the basic framework
of X:  the window hierarchy, the stacking order, and the concept of
wrapping.  These are the subjects of the next three sections.

only one parent is required to create a child window.  There is a
separate hierarchy for each screen.  At the top is the root
window, which fills the entire screen and is created when the server
initializes.  The first windows to be created by each client are
children of the root window.  In the client's first call to
XCreateWindow() or
ID="IX-1002-2-78"XCreateWindowID="IX-1002-2-79"XCreateSimpleWindowXCreateSimpleWindow() (either of which creates a new window),
the root window is the parent.

top-level windows of each application and they are managed by
the window manager.  LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," describes the special
procedures required of a client before displaying, moving, or
resizing this window.Each child may also have its own child windows. These child windows
of the top-level windows are used to create application features
like command buttons and scrollbars.Figure 2-6 shows a window hierarchy as it might appear
on the screen, and Figure 2-7 shows the same hierarchy in
schematic form.  Note that the windows A through G
represent subwindows of each application, which may not overlap
like this in real applications.  Normally the subwindows are used
as command buttons or panes which are laid out in non-overlapping
fashion, as was shown in Figure 2-4.  However, this hypothetical
hierarchy serves to demonstrate the effects of the stacking order
and the window hierarchy.

child windows do not extend beyond the borders of the parent even
when they are positioned in such a way that they would otherwise

window G will not be drawn beyond the bottom of window 3
even if its height would suggest that it should.)  If a window is
moved in such a way that it would extend beyond the parent, it is
clipped, so that only the part overlapping the parent is displayed.ID="IX-1002-2-89"hierarchy of windowstermsThese are the terms used to describe subsets of the window hierarchy:ParentID="IX-1002-2-90"windowsparentThe window used when creating a child window.ChildID="IX-1002-2-91"child windowsA window created with another window as parent.SubwindowID="IX-1002-2-92"subwindowdefinitionSynonymous with child.

move with it, just as they do (because of the window-based coordinate
system) when the parent is moved around the screen.Figures 2-6 and 2-7 showed a set of windows on the
screen and their hierarchy, and if you look carefully, you can see
how the stacking order affects each group of sibling windows.
Notice that window 2 is above window C and all the
other children of window 1.ID="S2-1002-2-9"Mapping and VisibilityID="IX-1002-2-112"mappingwindowsID="IX-1002-2-113"windowsmappingID="IX-1002-2-114"windowsvisibilityA newly created window does not immediately appear on the screen.
It is an abstract entity that cannot be drawn to (unless a backing
store feature--discussed later in this section--is implemented

Mapping marks a window as eligible for display.  If it is not
obscured by siblings or siblings of ancestors, it may be visible,
and only then can it be drawn to.ID="IX-1002-2-115"XMapWindowID="IX-1002-2-116"XMapRaisedXMapWindow() maps a window in its current position in the stacking

mapped before, these two calls are equivalent, since the initial stacking
position of a new window is on top.You must map a window before you have any chance of seeing it, but that
alone is not enough.  A number of factors can affect whether any window,
newly created or already mapped, is visible:

information from the server.  More information on this topic was
provided in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-2"Section 2.1.2, "Buffering."The initial mapping of a top-level window is a special case, since
the window's visibility may be delayed by the window manager due to
substructure redirection that was briefly described in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-5"Section 2.1.5, "The Window Manager."
For complicated reasons, a client must wait for the first Expose
event before assuming that its window is visible and drawing into it.
It is not important to understand why this is true at this point.ID="IX-1002-2-122"XUnmapWindowAn important consequence of these rules, and one of the reasons for
them, is that unmapping a window (with XUnmapWindow()) erases
ID="IX-1002-2-123"XUnmapWindow
the window and all its descendants from the screen.  X allows you
(or, actually, the window manager) to control the placement and
visibility of an entire client made up of a hierarchy of windows
simply by manipulating the top-level window.ID="IX-1002-2-124"configurationwhile unmappedID="IX-1002-2-125"window attributeswhile unmappedID="IX-1002-2-126"windowsunmappingID="IX-1002-2-127"unmapping windowsID="IX-1002-2-128"drawingwhile unmapped
The window configuration and window attributes are maintained when a
window is unmapped.  But it is important to remember that the X server
does not automatically preserve the visible contents of a window.  Graphic
operations on a window that is not visible or that is unmapped have no
effect.  Graphics visible in a window will be erased when that window is
obscured and then exposed.  For these reasons, it is important for the
client to be prepared to redraw the contents of the window on demand,

that maintains the window contents when a window is unmapped or covered
by other windows, so that the window is automatically refreshed with the
current contents when it becomes visible again.  This feature is expensive
in terms of computing resources and should be invoked only for windows
whose contents are difficult to recreate.  On many types of equipment, this
feature is not supported, so for the sake of portability, programs should
be capable of recreating the contents of their windows in other ways.  This
portability is particularly important in X, because network environments often
employ various brands of equipment.ID="IX-1002-2-131"windowsmappingID="IX-1002-2-132"windowsunmappingID="IX-1002-2-133"unmapping windowsID="IX-1002-2-134"mappingwindows

concepts used in graphics under the X Window System.  You will
see these terms used in Chapters 3, Basic Window Program and 4, Window Attributes
before we get to a serious treatment of graphics

displays.  In the simplest black-and-white display, there is a
single bit per pixel:  the state of that bit determines whether
the pixel will be black or white.  In color systems or on monochrome
systems allowing gray-scale displays, there are multiple bits per pixel.ID="IX-1002-2-143"bits per pixelThe state of the multiple bits assigned to each pixel does not directly
control the color or gray-scale intensity of that pixel.  Instead they
are used as an index to a lookup table called a colormap, as shown
in Figure 2-8.  On a color display, a pixel consists of separate
red, green, and blue phosphors, each sensitive to a separate electron
beam; the relative intensity of these three colors fools the eye into
thinking it sees a single color.  Accordingly, the colormap contains
an array of red, green, and blue (RGB) triples.  In other words, if
the value of the bits for a given pixel (a pixel value) is 14,
the RGB values of the fourteenth member of the colormap will be
displayed at that location on the screen.

which translates a pixel value into a specified set of red, green,
and blue values.  All bitmapped displays have at least one hardware
colormap, though in the case of a single-plane monochrome screen, it
may consist of only two colorcells.  In most cases, all clients share
the single colormap by allocating only the number of colorcells they
need and sharing as many as possible.  When clients have special
requirements, however, X allows them to have private colorcells or
to create virtual colormaps which are then swapped into the hardware
colormap (if it is writable) when necessary.Note that each window can potentially specify a different colormap.
This is the significance of the fact that the colormap is a window
attribute.

displays usually have from 2 to 4 planes.  X11 supports up to 32 planes.ID="IX-1002-2-151"colormap indexdefinitionAs can be inferred from the previous discussion of bits per pixel as
an index to the colormap, the number of possible colors or shades of
gray that can be simultaneously displayed on the screen is
2n, where n is the number of planes in the display.  (Of course,
additional colors can be made available even on a system with only
a few planes, at the cost of existing colors, simply by loading
different RGB values into the hardware colormap if it is writable.)All graphics calculations are performed on the pixel values before
they are translated into RGB.  The source pixel values

specified in a drawing request and the old destination pixel
values are combined according to a plane mask, clip mask, and logical
function to arrive at the final destination pixel values.  The
plane mask, clip mask, and logical function are aspects of a structure
called the graphics context (GC) and are described in LINKEND="CH-1002-5-1"Chapter 5, "The Graphics Context."ID="IX-1002-2-153"macrosBlackPixelID="IX-1002-2-154"macrosWhitePixelID="IX-1002-2-155"BlackPixel macroID="IX-1002-2-156"WhitePixel macro

the colors of black and white may not actually be black and white,
but they are guaranteed to be contrasting.

Pixmaps are
also valid destinations for most graphics requests.  A pixmap
is a block of off-screen memory in the server.  Windows and pixmaps
are collectively known as drawables.ID="IX-1002-2-162"pixmapsdefinitionID="IX-1002-2-163"pixmapscreating
A pixmap is an array of pixel values.  It has a depth just like a window.
It does not, however, have a position relative to any other window or
pixmap, and it does not have window attributes such as a colormap.  All
of those things affect a pixmap only when it is copied into a window.
And a pixmap becomes visible only when copied to a window.There are several routines for creating pixmaps.  The simplest is
XCreatePixmap(), which creates an empty pixmap with undefined
contents.  Always remember to clear a pixmap created with
XCreatePixmap() before using it, otherwise it may contain garbage.
ID="IX-1002-2-164"pixmapsclearing before use
Several others create pixmaps and fill a pixmap from data stored in
a file.  These functions will be mentioned later in the context of
the various uses of pixmaps.Some routines operate only on pixmaps or only on windows.  These
routines specify either Pixmap or Window as the
argument.  If either is allowed, the argument to the Xlib routine
will be specified as a Drawable.  All the drawing routines
specify the Drawable argument type.A pixmap is not susceptible to being covered by other windows.
Windows, on the other hand, may only be drawn to usefully when
they are visible, since their contents are not maintained when
they are obscured or unmapped (unless the backing store feature
is available and in effect).
ID="IX-1002-2-165"pixmapsversus windows as drawing destinationsID="IX-1002-2-166"window managerversus pixmaps as drawing destinationsTo be copied to a window with XCopyArea(), a pixmap must
have the same depth as the window it is to be copied to.  Once
copied, the colormap associated with the window is used to
translate the pixel values from the pixmap to visible colors.
After copying, additional drawing into the pixmap does not
appear in the window.  A single plane of a pixmap of any depth
can be copied into any window with XCopyPlane().In short, windows have the disadvantage that, when they are not
visible, drawing to them will not do anything.  A pixmap, which
represents an area of the screen, resides in memory and can be
drawn to at any time.  Unfortunately, pixmaps must be copied into
a visible window before the user can see them.  This copying can
have performance penalties.  Perhaps more importantly, off-screen
ID="IX-1002-2-167"off-screen memory
memory in the server used for pixmaps may be limited in quantity.
Therefore, programs that use a lot of pixmaps may not work on PC
servers and X terminals.ID="IX-1002-2-168"bitmapsdefinitionA pixmap of depth 1 is known as a bitmap, though there
is no separate type or resource called Bitmap.  A bitmap is a
two-dimensional array of bits used for many purposes including
cursor definitions, fonts, and templates for two-color pictures.
Each bit represents a single pixel value that is either set (1)
or unset (0).  Depending on the visual type, these pixel values
can be interpreted as two colors or simply as black and white.

lines, rectangles, polygons, arcs, text, and so on.  Routines that
draw graphics are generically called graphics primitives.
ID="IX-1002-2-173"graphics primitivesID="IX-1002-2-174"primitive graphics
But in X, a given graphics primitive does not contain all the
information needed to draw a particular graphic.  A server resource
called the graphics context (GC) specifies the remaining
variables, such as the line width, colors, and fill patterns.  The
ID of a GC is specified as an argument to the drawing routine and
modifies the appearance of everything that is drawn into the drawable.The GC must be created by the client before any drawing is done.
ID="IX-1002-2-175"graphics contextwhen to set
The created GC is stored in the server, so that the information
it contains does not have to be sent with every graphics
primitive--only its ID is passed.  This improves the performance
of drawing significantly since it reduces the traffic over the
connection between Xlib and the server.  All GC settings apply to
all graphics drawn using that GC.More than one GC can be created, and each can be set with different
values.  This allows a program to switch between GCs and get different
effects with the same graphics primitive.ID="S2-1002-2-14"Tiles and StipplesID="IX-1002-2-176"tilesdefinitionWhen pixmaps are used for patterning an area, such as for the
background of a window or in a GC, they are often referred to
as tiles or stipples.A tile is a pixmap with the same depth as the drawable it
is used to pattern.  The tile is typically 16 by 16 pixels but
can be other sizes--certain sizes are drawn faster--depending
on the hardware (see XQueryBestTile()).  It is typically
ID="IX-1002-2-177"XQueryBestTile
composed of only two different pixel values since this is the
easiest type to create, but multiple pixel values are permitted.
Areas drawn by any of the drawing routines can be tiled by placing
certain values in the GC.  The background and border of windows
can be tiled by specifying a pixmap in the window attributes.
ID="IX-1002-2-178"stippledefinitionA stipple is a pixmap of depth 1.  A stipple is used in
conjunction with a foreground pixel value and sometimes a
background pixel value to pattern an area in a way similar to a
tile.  There are two styles of stippling that can be set in the
graphics context.  In one, set bits in the stipple are drawn in
the foreground color and unset bits are drawn in the background
color.  In the other, only the set bits in the stipple are drawn
in the foreground pixel value, and the pixels in the destination
represented by unset bits in the stipple are not changed.  Like
tiling, stippling affects only those pixels that are selected by
the graphics request, such as the pixels drawn for a line or a
character.  Stipples are only present in the GC and cannot be
used for window backgrounds.Figure 2-9 shows how a tile is used to pattern the
background of a window.ID="FG-1002-2-9"Tiling of a window backgroundFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.2.09.gif" ID="GC-1002-2-9"ID="S1-1002-2-4"More on Window CharacteristicsID="IX-1002-2-179" SPAN="START"windowscharacteristicsThis section expands on the overview of window characteristics

Setting the window attributes does not affect the depth, class,
or visual of a window; these are permanently set when the window

ID="IX-1002-2-211"window managerWe will not go into detail here about how the application must
interact with the window manager when attempting to map a window
or change a window's configuration.  For now, suffice it to say
that there are certain rules the application must follow so that
the window manager can be responsible for controlling what is on
the screen and where.  See LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," for an
introduction to client-window manager interaction
and LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication," for a complete description.ID="S2-1002-2-17"Class: InputOutput and InputOnly WindowsID="IX-1002-2-212"InputOutput windowID="IX-1002-2-213"InputOnly windowID="IX-1002-2-214"windowsInputOutputID="IX-1002-2-215"windowsInputOnlyID="IX-1002-2-216"class (window)InputOutputID="IX-1002-2-217"class (window)InputOnlyThe X Window System provides two classes of windows:  InputOutput
and InputOnly.  The main difference between the two classes
is that an InputOnly window cannot be used as a drawable
(a destination for a graphics request).  Consequently, InputOnly
windows have a more limited set of window attributes, have no border
and a transparent background, and cannot have InputOutput
windows as children.InputOnly windows make an invisible area of the screen in
which input has a different purpose but the display is not changed.
InputOnly windows usually are assigned a different cursor
to distinguish them.  InputOnly windows are rarely used.The class of a window is assigned at creation and cannot be changed.ID="S2-1002-2-18"Depth and VisualID="IX-1002-2-218"depthID="IX-1002-2-219"windowsdepthID="IX-1002-2-220"visualsID="IX-1002-2-221"windowsvisualThe depth and visual of a window are assigned at creation and
cannot be changed.  The depth is the number of planes that
are to be used to represent gray scales or color within a window;
depth is also the number of bits per pixel.  The maximum depth
allowable for an InputOutput window is the number of
planes supported by the screen with which it is associated.  If
a screen has 12 planes, a window may have at most 12 bits per
pixel, and therefore there are at most
2 12
possible different shades of gray or color.The depth of an InputOnly window is always 0.
ID="IX-1002-2-222"depthof InputOnly
For InputOutput windows, the symbol CopyFromParent,
when used as the depth argument in XCreateWindow(),
copies the depth of the parent window.  Most windows use the
default depth, inherited from the root window.ID="IX-1002-2-223"XVisualInfo structureID="IX-1002-2-224"structuresXVisualInfo
The visual accounts for the differences between various types
ID="IX-1002-2-225"visuals
of display hardware in determining the way pixel values are translated
into visible colors within a particular window.  A screen may support
only one visual or several types of visuals.  An XVisualInfoID="IX-1002-2-226"XVisualInfo structure
structure contains all the information about a particular visual.
One member of XVisualInfo is the visual class, which has one

These values specify the characteristics of the colormaps that can be
used with the window--whether the colormap is read-only or read/write,
color or monochrome, split into three primary colors or composite.
Other members of XVisualInfo specify the valid range of pixel
values; how many bits of the pixel are allocated to red, green, and
blue; and several other variables.Both the depth and visual are inherited from the parent when a
window is created with XCreateSimpleWindow().  For more

"main" window exists and is available but is not currently mapped
on the screen.Most window managers allow the user to iconify an application
to get it out of the way without destroying it.  Deiconifying an
application is faster and more convenient than running the application
from scratch.  Also, the iconified application keeps running whatever
processes it was at work on when iconified (unless the application is
programmed to halt when it is iconified).  When input is required, the
program may either wait until the window is deiconified or accept input
in the icon.Figure 2-10 shows an xterm window before and after it is
iconified.  The xterm application does not create an icon pixmap,
and therefore, the window manager uwm simply draws its icon name
into the icon.  The appearance and placement of icons varies between
window managers.ID="FG-1002-02-10"An application and its iconFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.2.10.gif" ID="GC-1002-2-10"ID="IX-1002-2-235"iconsand window managerIcon windows are managed and, in many cases, created by the window
manager.  Through the window manager hints (which will be detailed
in LINKEND="S2-1002-3-8"Section 3.2.8, "Communicating with the Window Manager" and LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication"), an application
passes its icon's name and pixmap to be displayed in the icon window.
If an application needs to perform operations on its own icon window
(perhaps to be able to change the background at any time, as the mail
handler xmh does to indicate that mail has arrived), it can
create its own icon window and pass the window ID to the window
manager.  Otherwise, the window manager will create the icon window.The window manager may specify in a property on the root window what
sizes of icon pixmaps it prefers.  If this property is set, the
application should attempt to provide an icon pixmap of an acceptable
size.  The window manager may also specify where icons will be placed.
These are optional features of the window manager that may not be
present.  In fact, most current window managers
do not specify icon sizes or control icon location.

to occur.  These are two of the simplest and most common event types,
but there are many others.  An event is a packet of information that is
generated by the server when certain actions occur and is queued for
later use by the client.  The queued events can be read at any subsequent
time in any order, but they are usually read and processed in the order
in which they occurred.Here are some other sorts of events:
ID="IX-1002-2-244"typeof eventsMARK="BULLET"Mouse (or other pointer) button pressed or released.
(ButtonPress, ButtonRelease)Window mapped or unmapped.  (MapNotify, UnmapNotify)Mouse crossing a window boundary.  (EnterNotify, LeaveNotify)These event types are usually used for user input and to control
a user interface.A second group of events reports side effects of window operations.
For example, when a window becomes visible after being obscured,
it receives an Expose event.  When window gravity (a window
attribute that controls the position of a window when the parent is
resized) takes effect, a GravityNotify event is generated.A third purpose of events is to allow various clients to communicate
with each other and with the window manager.  The events that report
the following actions are usually used for the second purpose.MARK="BULLET"A client may request that all keyboard input be sent to a
particular window regardless of the pointer position; this is called
a keyboard focus window.  Changing keyboard focus from one window
to another causes FocusIn and FocusOut events, indicating
to the client whether or not it can expect further keyboard events.Changing the mapping between keyboard keys and codes they generate
causes a MappingNotify event to be sent to all clients.Reparenting a window is sometimes done by the window manager to
add a frame to windows on the screen.  This action causes a
ReparentNotify event.A PropertyNotify event is generated when a client changes a
property on a window.SelectionClear, SelectionNotify, and SelectionRequest
events are used to communicate back and forth between a client that is
allowing a user to select a section of text (or other information) and a
client that is allowing the user to place the information in its window.
Some of these events are sent with XSendEvent.At this point, it is only important to understand in general what
events are, not precisely what each one is for or how to use them.
LINKEND="CH-1002-8-1"Chapter 8, "Events," and LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer,"
will provide complete details.ID="S2-1002-2-22"Selection and Propagation of EventsID="IX-1002-2-245"eventspropagationID="IX-1002-2-246"eventsselectingID="IX-1002-2-247"selecting eventsID="IX-1002-2-248"inputselectingA client must select the event types that it wants the server
to send for each window.  The selection is made by calling
XSelectInput(), which sets the event_maskID="IX-1002-2-249"XSelectInput
window attribute, by setting that attribute with the more general
XChangeWindowAttributes() routine, or when calling
ID="IX-1002-2-250"XChangeWindowAttributesXCreateWindow().For example, a scrollbar may require mouse button events but not
keyboard events, while the main window of an application may require
keyboard but not mouse events.  One would select different event types
on each of these windows.Keyboard and pointer events are generated in the smallest window
enclosing the pointer (or grabbing the pointer, as discussed
in LINKEND="S3-1002-8-2"Section 8.3.2.2, "Keyboard and Pointer Grabbing").  Then an event of one of these types (only)
propagates upward through the window hierarchy until the event type
is found in the event_mask or do_not_propagate_maskID="IX-1002-2-251"event maskattributeID="IX-1002-2-252"do_not_propagate_mask attributeID="IX-1002-2-253"attributesevent_maskID="IX-1002-2-254"attributesdo_not_propagate_mask
attributes of the window.  If the event is found in an event_mask
first (or in both on the same window), then the event is sent as if it
occurred in that window, and if it is found in a do_not_propagate_mask
first, then it is never sent.  The ID of the window that finally received
the event (if any) is put in the window member of the event structure.The do_not_propagate_mask can only be set with
XChangeWindowAttributes() or XCreateWindow().
ID="IX-1002-2-255"XChangeWindowAttributes
Events other than keyboard and pointer events do not propagate.
They occur in the window in which they were selected when the
appropriate action occurs.For most types of events, a copy of an event can be sent to more
than one client if each client has selected that event type on that
window.  Each client has its own event mask for each window.  The
client that created the window need not do anything to cooperate.
The second client that wants to get an event from a window that it
did not create simply needs to find out the ID of the window and
then select the desired event types with XSelectInput() on
that window.

A duplicate event is sent to each window, and these events propagate
independently up through the hierarchy in the two applications.  This
is rarely done, because there is usually no reason for any program other
than the window manager to play with another application's windows.ID="S2-1002-2-23"The Event QueueID="IX-1002-2-260"queueeventID="IX-1002-2-261"event queuesWhat do we mean when we say that an event is queued?  Each client has
its own event queue which receives the selected events in the order they
are sent by the server, as was shown in Figure 2-2.The client then can remove each event at any time and process it according
to its type and the other information in each event structure.  There are
several functions that get input, and they differ in how many windows are
monitored and what types of events are sought.  The client can also read
events on the queue without removing them, remove one and then put it back,
or clear the queue by throwing away all the events.  Events can also be
created by a program and sent to the window manager or other programs.ID="S2-1002-2-24"An Event StructureID="IX-1002-2-262"exposure eventID="IX-1002-2-263"eventsExposeExpose is one of the most important event types, and its event
structure is shown in Example 2-1.  It is generated when an

area of a window becomes visible on the screen and indicates that the
client must redraw that area.  This happens when a window is mapped,
moved, resized, or deiconified or when an obscuring window is unmapped.
Exposure events are common and can happen at any time, since they may be
caused by the actions of other clients.ID="EX-1002-2-1"An event structuretypedef struct {

ID="IX-1002-2-266"event structureID="IX-1002-2-267"event typesThe type of event is reported in every event structure--in the
XExposeEvent structure, the type field would be the
symbolic constant Expose.  The window to which the event
propagated is reported in the window member, present in all
but five event types (those dealing with selections and graphics
exposure).  All other information in the event structures is
specific to certain event types and is described in detail in
Appendix E, Event Reference.ID="S2-1002-2-25"The Event LoopID="IX-1002-2-268"event loopsBecause events can arrive in any order, the structure of code to
handle them is predetermined.  Every program contains an event loop
in which each event is received and processed.  Normally this loop
is implemented as an infinite while loop, beginning with an
event-getting routine and followed by a switch statement
that branches according to the event type.  Within each branch for
an event type, there may be additional branches corresponding to the
window in which the event occurred or other fields in the event structure.ID="IX-1002-2-269"exposureas inputID="IX-1002-2-270"inputchecking for exposure
The loop will almost always include exposure events.  X does not
normally keep track of the contents of the obscured regions of windows.
It is the responsibility of the program to make sure that the window
contents can be redrawn when exposure occurs.  The program must be
ID="IX-1002-2-271"redrawingexposed regions
prepared to receive and act on an exposure event at any time, meaning
at every invocation of the event-gathering routine.  A program may work
perfectly as long as there are no other programs running, but that is
not good enough in a window environment!When a window is first mapped, the first function of the program
must be to read the exposure event that is generated by mapping
the window.  Then the program can draw the window's contents.  As
it turns out, this is also how the program should respond when an
exposure event arrives at any later time.  The first drawing and
later redrawing are done in exactly the same way, using the same code.Note, however, that another type of event, ConfigureNotify,
must be handled in case the window manager modified the size of the
application before mapping it and in case the user later resizes the
window.  More will be said about this in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."ID="S1-1002-2-6"How to Program with XlibID="IX-1002-2-272"programmingtipsThis section reviews what is important to know about X programming
before you write any code.  Describing what goes into the designing,
writing, and debugging of X programs should give you a better start
when you begin your own programming.The basic program described in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program" illustrates many
of the issues described here.ID="S2-1002-2-26"Designing an X ApplicationLet's begin by outlining the major tasks any X application must perform.From the user's standpoint, almost any application under any window
system will do the obvious things:  create a window on the screen
of an appropriate size, determine a position for some text and/or
graphics within the window, draw into the window, and accept keyboard
and/or pointer input, changing the screen accordingly.  Essentially,
the top-level window of the application is treated very much like the
whole screen would be treated on a PC.  These tasks are straightforward
and most programmers should find them familiar.There are, of course, a few complications resulting from the
unique features of window systems in general and the X Window
System in particular.  These complications determine the design
requirements for an application that is to run under X.ID="S3-1002-2-1"Design RequirementsID="IX-1002-2-273"design requirements for applicationsThe following four paragraphs describe the things X applications
must do that are not obvious.  These are things that must be done
for the application to operate properly under X but that the
average user might not notice or know about.First, X allows workstations to be connected in a network in
ID="IX-1002-2-274"networkspermission
which any host or node may run X programs and display them on any
other node, given permission.  This means that the program must be
able to accept the user's specification of which display to use.
(Remember that each display has its own server, so choosing the
display is equivalent to establishing the connection between the
client and a particular server.)  This requirement turns out to
be built in and requires virtually no programming, as is described
in LINKEND="S2-1002-3-2"Section 3.2.2, "Connecting to a Server."ID="IX-1002-2-275"limited resourcesuse ofID="IX-1002-2-276"colormapsuse ofID="IX-1002-2-277"screen spaceuse of
Second, the application must be responsible in its use of the limited
resources of the display, chiefly screen space and colormaps.  This is
because there may be many applications running concurrently on a single
screen, sharing those limited resources.  The client in charge of
managing these limited resources is the window manager.  There are
certain requirements for communication between each application and the
window manager to ensure that competing needs can be fairly arbitrated
and to help make sure that the user sees a consistent user interface.
These requirements are not difficult to meet for simple applications,
but they get more complex for serious applications.  This area is
described in LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."Third, other clients may be moved over your client and then moved
away, requiring your client to redraw its window or windows.  X cannot
maintain the contents of an unlimited number of overlapping windows,
and it is inefficient for it to try to maintain even a few.  Your
client will be told when redrawing is necessary and in what areas.
This requirement is not hard to meet, but it encourages programming
in a way that records the current "state" of each window so that it
can be redrawn.  The handling of exposure is
described in LINKEND="S2-1002-3-13"Section 3.2.13, "Setting Up an Event-gathering Loop."Fourth, the user may resize your application, so it should be capable
of recalculating the dimensions and placement of subwindows and
graphics to fit within the given window.In a nutshell, these four aspects are all that is required of an
X program beyond its basic functionality.  Fortunately, for most
clients without unique needs such as a custom colormap, these
requirements are straightforward to satisfy.ID="S3-1002-2-2"The User InterfaceID="IX-1002-2-278"user interfacedesigningThe first step in designing an application will be to determine what
its features will be.  Determining how the user will invoke those
features is probably the next step.  This means designing a user
interface.X was purposely designed to be "policy free," and therefore it does
not come with a standard user interface like many other window systems
do.  You will have to write all parts of the user interface yourself,
unless you choose to use one of the toolkits that are available.  Using
a toolkit makes building a user interface much easier and is strongly
recommended.  Otherwise, you must write menus, command buttons, dialog
boxes, and so forth and determine how they are to be used.  Although
there are many ways to write these user interface features, there is
a simple implementation of a menu in the winman program shown
in LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management," and an example of a dialog box routine
in LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer."  The writing of a command button routine
should be straightforward.ID="IX-1002-2-279"selectionsand user interfaceID="IX-1002-2-280"layering windowsID="IX-1002-2-281"windowslayering
The key elements that interact in the design of a user interface
are the hierarchy of windows and the selection and processing of
events, chiefly pointer and keyboard events.  Since these device
events propagate through the hierarchy depending on whether they
are selected for each window, both the hierarchy and the selection
together determine how events are received.  For every user action,
there must be a path (possibly unique, possibly common for several
different user actions) through the event-handling code that yields
some sort of response to the user, either by a visible change, a
message, or a beep.  Therefore, the job of the event loop is to
distinguish all the possible user actions and invoke the proper code.
In the main event loop, each case statement for an event type must
then have another switch, depending on the window which received the
event, before calling the function that performs the action the user
requested.  The event type and the window in which it occurred are
only two of the most common event structure members--there may be
additional switch statements based on other members, too, such as which
keys or buttons were being held while a key or button press occurred.Especially for complex programs, a careful design of the window
hierarchy and selection of events can simplify the code and save
hours of debugging.  We recommend drawing out the hierarchy of
windows and the types of events selected by each one and then
drawing in the events
that will be propagated to ancestor windows.
This helps find problems before any code is written.ID="S2-1002-2-27"Writing an X ApplicationID="IX-1002-2-282"applicationswritingThe best way to start writing an X application is probably to
copy the existing application that is most similar to your intended
purpose or to start from a skeleton program such as basicwin,
described in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."
Select one from the core portion of the standard distribution from
MIT, because these are the most likely to follow current conventions.
ID="IX-1002-2-283"interclient communicationconventionsThe following sections describe some basic facts about the actual
process of coding and compiling an application.ID="S3-1002-2-3"Resources and User CustomizabilityID="IX-1002-2-284"user defaultsID="IX-1002-2-285"resource databasesID="IX-1002-2-286"user preferencesID="IX-1002-2-287"preferencesuserAn application should not hardcode all the options that are possible
under X, such as colors and fonts.  It should allow the user to
specify the colors of all windows, the font to use, the display and
screen to use, the initial size and position of the application,
and a large number of other standard and application specific options.An application should provide command line options, but there are
too many variables to support all of them as command line options.
The developers of X have designed a better way for the user to
specify options, called resources.  The user places the desired
options in a file using a particular format and runs the X
application xrdb specifying this file as a command line
ID="IX-1002-2-288"xrdb application
argument.  xrdb places a property on the root window whose
value is the contents of this file.  Applications use a set of
Xlib routines collectively called the resource manager to return
ID="IX-1002-2-289"resource manager
a setting for each variable required.  The routine XGetDefault()ID="IX-1002-2-290"XGetDefault
makes this process quite easy for the application.  If the user
has not called xrdb to set the property on the root window,
XGetDefault() reads in a file called .Xdefaults in
ID="IX-1002-2-291".Xdefaults fileID="IX-1002-2-292"files.Xdefaults
the user's home directory.  The application itself should contain
a default value for each variable in case neither of these sources
contains a value for one of them.This use of the term resource is completely different from
the term server resource, which refers to windows and GCs.ID="IX-1002-2-293"resource managerA resource specification is a key/value pair.  A key/value pair may
apply only to a particular window within a particular application,
to an entire application, to a certain class of applications such as
editors, or to all applications.  The algorithm used to find the value
for a particular variable operates quite differently from a normal
database manager.  Given an incomplete specification of a key, it uses
an algorithm to determine which of the keys in the resource database is
the best match and returns the indicated value.  It always returns only
one value.  This is much different from a normal database manager which
would return many values if the key were too general.The resource manager and providing user customizability are
described in detail in LINKEND="CH-1002-13-1"Chapter 13, "Managing User Preferences."ID="S3-1002-2-4"Compiling and Linking X ProgramsID="IX-1002-2-294"Xlibcompiling withID="IX-1002-2-295"compiling with XlibID="IX-1002-2-296"linking with XlibID="IX-1002-2-297"Xliblinking withTo use all the functions in the X library, you need to include
<X11/Xlib.h>, <X11/Xutil.h>, <X11/keysym.h>,
and <X11/Xresource.h>.  These files define data structures,
macros, and symbols and declare the types of functions.  It is
also a good idea to include <X11/Xos.h>, which includes
certain header files commonly used in C programs that differ
in name or location between various operating systems, notably
System V and BSD.  To compile and link your program with all
the available Xlib libraries, including a symbol table for a
symbolic debugger, use:ID="SC-1002-2-1"cc -g -o outputfile inputfile.c -lX11The -lX11 option specifies linking with the standard
X library, Xlib.A set of routines to make it easier to port programs from X Version 10
to Version 11 is provided in a separate library.  To use the
X Version 10 compatibility functions, include <X11/X10.h> in

options to your cc command.  You may wish to include
<X11.Xos.h> if you use system calls, file manipulation, or
string manipulation utilities.  This header file includes the right
files for various operating systems.Several other libraries are available in the X distribution from
MIT:  Xmu, the miscellaneous utilities library, and Xext, the
extensions library (which requires additional server-side software
in order to function).  These are not yet adopted standards of the
X Consortium but are widely available.  If you use -lXmu, it
must be placed before Xlib on the compiling command line.  All toolkit
libraries based on Xlib such as Xt must also appear before -lX11
on the command line.  -lXext can appear before or after
-lX11 because it does not use Xlib.If, when compiling, you get errors about header files in
<X11/Xos.h> not being found, you are probably on a System V
system that does not define the symbol SYSV.  To solve this
problem, add -DSYSV to the command line.ID="IX-1002-2-303"makeusing for compilingYou will probably want to use make(1) when compiling time
could be saved by compiling smaller functions separately before
linking.  (For more information, see the Nutshell Handbook
Managing Projects with Make.)
Even better is to use make in combination with imake,
which generates makefiles from a portable description file.
imake is provided with the X distribution.  For more information

and constants.  You should be familiar with these conventions in
order to name your own functions and constants properly.  The major
conventions are:MARK="BULLET"The names of all Xlib functions begin with an X (capital x).  Compound
words are constructed by capitalizing the first letter of each word.
For example, a typical function name is XAllocColor().The names of most user-visible data structures and structure types
begin with an X.  The only exceptions are Depth, Display,
GC, Screen, ScreenFormat, and Visual.
Pointers to these six structures are quite commonly used in programs,
but their members should not be accessed except through pre-existing
macros.The names of all members of data structures use lower case.  Compound
words, where needed, are constructed with underscores (_).The names of macros do not begin with an X.  To distinguish macros
from user symbols (which are all caps), the first letter of each
word in the macro is capitalized.  (The macros used for quarks are
an exception to this rule, perhaps because they were once part of
a separate library.  Their names begin with Xrm.)The names of symbolic constants defined in X header files (#defined)
use mixed case, with the first letter of each word capitalized, and
do not begin with X.  Lowercase symbols are reserved for variables
and all uppercase for user symbols, according to existing convention.
The only exception is that predefined atom names use all uppercase
letters, with underscores separating the words.  Atom names begin
with XA_ to distinguish them from user symbols.You should choose constants and routine names that will not be
confused with standard Xlib functions, macros, or constants.  User
function names should not begin with X and perhaps should have the
first letter of the first word lower case to avoid confusion with
Xlib macros.  User constants should be all upper case.  Variable
names can be lower case as usual, with underscores separating the
words if desired, since X structure member references will always
be accompanied by the variable declared as the structure.

defined constants.  This style of programming may be unfamiliar to
some programmers.  We will describe how structures and constants are
typically used so that the idea will be familiar when you see the examples.ID="IX-1002-2-312"structure pointersID="IX-1002-2-313"pointers to structures
Pointers to structures are the major way of specifying data to and
returning data from Xlib routines.  If the routine returns data, the
returned value will be a pointer to the data structure, unless the
routine returns more than one structure, in which case one or all of
the structures will be arguments.  In some routines (primarily those
concerning color), a pointer-to-structure argument specifies some
information and returns some other information.When setting the characteristics of a server resource, such as a set of window
attributes, a graphics context, the cells in a colormap, or a hardware
characteristic (such as key click), both a structure and a mask are
specified as arguments.  The mask specifies which values in the
specified structure should be read when updating the resource values.
One bit in the mask is assigned to each member in the structure, and
a special constant is defined in the Xlib header files to represent
that member when constructing the mask.  Each of the mask constants
has one bit set.  The mask argument is made by combining any number
of the mask constants with the bitwise OR operator (|).  For
example, the CWBackgroundPixmap constant is used to indicate
that the background_pixmap member of the specified window
attributes structure is to be read and the corresponding member in the
resource changed.The other major use of defined constants in Xlib (other than for masks)
is as values for structure members themselves.  They indicate which of
a number of alternatives is true.  For example, several of the structure
members can have only the values True or False.  As
another example, the type member of each event structure can
have one of 33 different values, each represented by a different defined
constant such as Expose.  Defined constants are also used as
returned values.Defined constants are also used for predefined atoms.  As described
in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-4"Section 2.1.4, "Properties and Atoms" an atom is an integer value identifying a
property.  Atoms are used to avoid passing arbitrary-length property
name strings back and forth between the client and the server.ID="S3-1002-2-7"Performance OptimizingID="IX-1002-2-314"performanceoptimizingID="IX-1002-2-315"optimizing performanceWhile designing, writing, and debugging your application, you can look
for ways to improve its performance.Whenever possible, you should use Xlib functions that do not require
protocol replies.  That is, in functions that are called frequently,

especially in the event loop, avoid Xlib routines with names containing
Fetch, Get, or Query.  Most of these functions
return information from the server, and as such, they are subject to
network delays and will slow down your application.  Much of this
information can be had from events.In general, keep the feedback loop between the user's action and the
program's response as short as possible.ID="S3-1002-2-8"ANSI-C and POSIX PortabilityID="IX-1002-2-318"portabilityand R5ID="IX-1002-2-319"POSIXstandardsID="IX-1002-2-320"ANSI-CstandardsID="IX-1002-2-321"standardsPOSIXID="IX-1002-2-322"standardsANSI-CThe MIT Release 5 X distribution is compliant with ANSI-C and POSIX
standards, and portable across a wide variety of platforms.
While the goal of the ANSI-C and POSIX standards is portability,
many systems do not implement these standards, or do not implement
them fully, so the MIT R5 distribution defines new header files that
attempt to mask the differences between systems.
The header files are <X11/Xfuncproto.h>, <X11/Xfuncs.h>,
<X11/Xosdefs.h>, and <X11/Xos.h>.
The contents and usage of these header files are described in
Chapter 15, Other Programming Techniques.
None of these files are part of the official R5 standard, so
they may not be shipped with your system.  But they
can be very useful in writing portable applications, so we
have included them with the code from this book, which you can
get as described in the Preface.ID="S2-1002-2-28"Debugging an X ApplicationID="IX-1002-2-323" SPAN="START"debuggingX applicationsID="IX-1002-2-324" SPAN="START"Xdebugging applicationsAll programmers know that debugging is by far the most difficult
and time consuming aspect of programming.  This is where you catch
all the problems caused during the writing stage and often also
problems in the design stage.  One can rarely foresee all the
issues when designing a program.There are some techniques that make debugging X applications
easier.  One, of course, is to have good tools.  The C program
checker lint helps find problems such as mismatches in the
ID="IX-1002-2-325"lint program checker
number of arguments to a function, variables declared but not used,
or misused pointers.  Although it often finds something to complain
about that you do not consider an error, it also provides useful
information.ID="IX-1002-2-326"debuggingtools forUse of a good debugger such as dbx avoids the need to continually
ID="IX-1002-2-327"dbx
place printf statements in the code and recompile.The standard application xwininfo is good for displaying information
ID="IX-1002-2-328"xwininfo application
about a window, including its window ID and name, parent and children IDs
and names, all the window attributes, and the window manager hints set for
that window.  Use the -all option or see the xwininfo reference
page in Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide, for information on printing just the needed information.The standard application xprop, which displays the name, type,
ID="IX-1002-2-329"xprop application
and value of each property set on a window, is useful in debugging
applications that set or read properties.  It can also display font
properties.  This application is also described in Volume Three.If your application generates protocol errors during debugging,
it is easier to locate the error if you turn off Xlib's request
buffering (described in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-2"Section 2.1.2, "Buffering").  This is done with
the XSynchronize() call placed immediately after the call
ID="IX-1002-2-330"XSynchronize
to connect with the sever (XOpenDisplay()).One of the most common places to have difficulty debugging is
ID="IX-1002-2-331"debuggingtricks for
in event handling.  For this reason, we recommend that all
programs under development contain printf statements at
the beginning of each branch of their event handling, so that the
programmer can watch the sequence of events in one window and the
visible performance of the application in another.  This print
statement can be placed within a compile-time
#ifdef DEBUG, #endif pair.  Then define this
symbol on the compiling command line.  Later, all the print
statements can be taken out of the compiled code by simply
changing the command line when recompiling.  Although the event
types are coded as numbers and will normally be printed that way
by the printf statements, they are easily translated back into
strings that match their symbols using the technique described
in LINKEND="S2-1002-8-5"Section 8.2.5, "Printing the Event Type."X applications are difficult to test thoroughly.  Here are some
of the miscellaneous tests you should put your application through:
ID="IX-1002-2-332"applicationstestingID="IX-1002-2-333"testing an applicationMARK="BULLET"Be sure to try all combinations of raising and lowering
different windows to test the application's response to
exposure.  Does it redraw unnecessarily?Try all combinations of pressing and releasing different
pointer buttons to see if anything breaks.Try operating the program in a busy network environment.Try the application on a variety of different servers.
Does it work on both color and monochrome systems?Try running the application on machines with different
architectures and bit and byte orders.What happens when you type function keys or other unique
keys on a particular keyboard?Is it possible to crash the application by specifying the
wrong set of resources or command line arguments?If your application can pass all these tests, you have done a good job.ID="S3-1002-2-9"ErrorsID="IX-1002-2-334" SPAN="START"error handlingin programmingID="IX-1002-2-335" SPAN="START"programmingerror handlingID="IX-1002-2-336"errorsThere are really three levels of error handling in programs using
Xlib.  The first level you implement yourself by monitoring the
return status of the routines that create server resources.  This
allows the client to modify the arguments of the request and try
again.  The second level, protocol errors, is usually caused by a
programming error, and the third by a fatal system error such as a
crash of the machine running the server or network failure.  The
second two types are handled by two separate error-handling functions
that can be set by the client but, by default, simply print a message
and exit the client.As an example of the first level of error handling, a client should
always check to see whether it was successfully connected to the
ID="IX-1002-2-337"errorsthrough returned value
display server with XOpenDisplay() before proceeding.  If this
ID="IX-1002-2-338"XOpenDisplay
connection did not succeed, the client should print a message to
stderr indicating what happened and which server it attempted
to connect to.  This process will be demonstrated in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."X protocol errors occur when routine arguments do not conform
to accepted ranges or when IDs do not match existing resources,
etc.  These types of errors are sent to XErrorHandler.
ID="IX-1002-2-339"XErrorHandler
Fatal errors, such as a broken connection with the server, are
unrecoverable conditions and invoke the XIOErrorHandler.
ID="IX-1002-2-340"XIOErrorHandler
Both error handlers by default display an intelligible (if not
intelligent) message and then exit.The possible X protocol error messages and their general causes
are listed in Appendix B, Error Messages and Protocol Requests, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.
These error messages also specify which protocol request caused the
error, which you can also look up in Volume Two,  Appendix B, Error Messages and Protocol Requests
to determine which Xlib routine may have caused the error.  This
mapping is not unique because several Xlib routines often generate
the same protocol request.User-defined error-handling routines will be called from the error
handlers if you pass procedure names to XSetIOErrorHandler()ID="IX-1002-2-341"XSetIOErrorHandler
or XSetErrorHandler().  If either is passed a NULLID="IX-1002-2-342"XSetErrorHandler
function pointer, the respective default handler will be reinstated.
ID="IX-1002-2-343"reinstating default error handlerID="IX-1002-2-344"error handlingreinstating defaultIf you write your own error-handling routines, it is recommended
that you use XGetErrorText() or XGetErrorDatabaseText()ID="IX-1002-2-345"XGetErrorTextID="IX-1002-2-346"XGetErrorDatabaseText
to get the string describing an error code, so that the codes of
extensions can be handled properly.  XGetErrorDatabaseText()
uses the resource manager to provide error messages from the file
XErrorDB, located by default in /usr/lib/X11.Only the error-handling routine XErrorHandler
(or the one you define) receives error events.
These events cannot be selected or received by windows.

it is often informative to look up the protocol request as well
as the error code to determine which function the error occurred
in.  You cannot rely on the debugger to indicate where the error
occurred because of Xlib's request buffering and other delays.It is useful to use XSynchronize() to make sure that
protocol errors are displayed as soon as they occur.  When
ID="IX-1002-2-357"XSynchronizeXSynchronize() is invoked, the performance of graphics will
be drastically reduced.  The same result occurs by setting the
global variable _Xdebug to any nonzero value when running

recursively call back into Xlib from a signal handler, the
program will hang or crash.  This is mostly an issue on systems
that feature threads or multiple processors.
The correct way to handle signals is to never make Xlib calls
from signal handlers.

are needed in virtually all Xlib programs.  The <X11/Xlib.h>file contains declarations of structure types used in Xlib functions.
<X11/Xlib.h> in turn includes <X11/X.h>, which sets up
many defined constants.  <X11/Xutil.h> contains more structure
definitions and defined constants for certain groups of Xlib functions.
Many of the structures and constant definitions from these include
files are described in this manual with the functions in which they
are used.  Structures and constants are also presented on many of
the reference pages in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, if the routine on that page uses a
structure or defined constant as an argument or return value.
Appendix , Structure Reference, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, provides an alphabetical

provides the definitions of constants.The final include file referenced in the Example 3-1 is

argument to XOpenDisplay() have the same format.  The format
ID="IX-1002-3-46"XOpenDisplay
is host:server.screen, in which host refers to the name
ID="IX-1002-3-47"hostserver.screen syntax
of the machine running the server; server, the server number
on that machine; and screen, the screen number on that server.LINKEND="FN-1002-3-1"ID="FN-1002-3-1"MIT's manual describes this format as host:display.screen,
using display instead of server.  Since most people think
of screens and displays as virtually the same thing, their description
leads to confusion.  The second member in the string really identifies
which server on a particular host to connect to.  Each of these servers
would support a user.The server number can be thought of as the number of the user on
a particular host.  The server number is always zero on a
single-user workstation and may be nonzero only if a single host
has a separate keyboard, pointer, and display for more than one user,
all connected by wires (not networks) to the central host.  Systems
that run multiple X servers are rare.The .screen part is optional and only specifies which screen
is returned by the DefaultScreen() macro (more on macros in a
ID="IX-1002-3-48"DefaultScreen macroID="IX-1002-3-49"macrosDefaultScreen
minute).  You can still use any or all of the screens controlled by
the specified server.  For example, Perseus:0.1 instructs the
server you are running the program on to connect to server 0
on the host called Perseus and that the default screen on that
server for this program will be screen 1.LINKEND="FN-1002-3-2"ID="FN-1002-3-2"Note that most servers only control a single screen.  However,
an X server can support multiple screens.  The most common example is
probably the Apple MacX server for the Macintosh.The XOpenDisplay() routine returns a pointer to a structure of
ID="IX-1002-3-50"XOpenDisplaypassing NULL
type Display.  If the connection is successful, the structure
will be filled with information about the server and each of its screens.
If the attempt to create a connection fails, XOpenDisplay() returns
NULL.  The code in Example 3-2 above checks to make sure
ID="IX-1002-3-51"NULLpassing to XOpenDisplay
this returned pointer is not NULL before proceeding.  The message
printed when the connection fails includes the text returned by the
XDisplayName() function.  This function returns display_name
or, if that is NULL, the UNIX environment DISPLAY variable.
XDisplayName() is necessary, since without it, there would be no way
ID="IX-1002-3-52"XDisplayName
to tell the user to what server an attempt to connect was made.The client might not succeed in connecting to a server for a number of
reasons.  Most likely, the display_name variable or DISPLAY
environment variable does not specify a valid server that is connected
via the network to the machine on which you are running the program.
Or perhaps the network is out of order.  Another possibility is that
the server and client use different versions of the X protocol.
ID="IX-1002-3-53"protocol revision compatibilityID="IX-1002-3-54"connection with serverrefusal of connectionID="IX-1002-3-55"refused connectionreasons for
X Version 11 programs are not compatible with X Version 10 and
vice versa, so that if such a connection is attempted, an error
message such as "protocol mismatch" should be printed, since the
connection will partially succeed.  All releases of X Version 11,
however, are compatible since they use the same protocol.The connection will also fail if the host you are running the client
on is not on the host access list of the server you are trying
ID="IX-1002-3-56"host access listID="IX-1002-3-57"authentication
to display on.  The host access list is a simple permission mechanism.
A server reads the list of hosts as it starts up and may be connected
only to clients running on these hosts.  There are commands to add and
remove hosts from the access list, but these can be called only from
clients running on the host whose list is being changed.  In all these
cases, the code shown in Example 3-2 will simply print the name
of the server to which the connection failed and no further information.In R4, a simple authorization scheme has also been implemented.  If the
person operating the server has turned authorization on, Xlib must know
a secret code in order to connect to that server.  Xlib gets this code
from a file, and the server puts it there to grant access.If Example 3-2 executes successfully past opening the display,
we can begin to set up variables for use in the rest of the program.
The first of these is the global variable screen_num, set to
the return value of the DefaultScreen() macro.  screen_num
will be used throughout the program to indicate which screen on the
server our operations are to affect.  It is important to use the
DefaultScreen() macro rather than to hardcode 0 as the
screen used by the client, because even without command line parsing

with a display.  They all get their information from the Display
structure returned by XOpenDisplay().  But this is not the only
useful information we can get from the Display structure.  There
are numerous other macros that supply information about the characteristics
of the server and its screens.  We will describe these macros where they
come in handy in this manual.  The complete set of macros that access the
members of the Display structure is listed and described
in Appendix C, Macros, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.  They tell you whether the server
supports certain features like backing store and motion history buffers,
the protocol version and release and the name of the server vendor, and
much more.  The Display structure also provides information about
each screen, such as the root window dimensions and the number of planes.
ID="IX-1002-3-67"structuresDisplayID="IX-1002-3-68"Display structurecontents ofID="IX-1002-3-69"macrosintroductionThe macros are provided both for convenience and because the
Display structure is intended to be opaque; clients should
not access its members directly.  The reason for it being opaque
is that Xlib's authors want to retain the option to change the
members in the Display structure without making existing
clients obsolete.ID="S2-1002-3-4"Getting Window InformationID="IX-1002-3-70"windowsgetting informationMost clients need to know the size of the screen so that the output
can be tailored to look the same--or to look good--on any display.
There are two ways to get this information:  you can access members
ID="IX-1002-3-71"screensgetting information about
of the Display structure to get information about the root
window or you can use XGetGeometry() or XGetWindowAttributes()ID="IX-1002-3-72"XGetGeometryID="IX-1002-3-73"XGetWindowAttributes
to get the root window's dimensions.  The first method, using the macros
for accessing information from the Display structure, works only
for the root window but is more efficient.  The second and third methods,
reading the window geometry or attributes, work for any window.ID="IX-1002-3-74"dimensionsof screenID="IX-1002-3-75"displaydimensionsID="IX-1002-3-76"dimensionsof root windowID="IX-1002-3-77"root windowdimensionsID="IX-1002-3-78"Display structurecontents of
To get the dimensions of a screen in pixels, you can use the macros
DisplayWidth() and DisplayHeight().  The macros
DisplayWidthMM() and DisplayHeightMM() return the screen
dimensions in millimeters.  These four macros get their information
locally from the Display structure, so they are fast and
efficient. The ratio of width in millimeters to width in pixels gives
you a measurement of the spacing between pixels horizontally, and the
same process can be used to determine the vertical pixel spacing.  This
ID="IX-1002-3-79"screensaspect ratioID="IX-1002-3-80"aspect ratio
can be important because when you draw a circle, it will look more like
an ellipse on screens that do not have the same pixel spacing in both
directions (usually inexpensive PC servers).  You can tailor your drawing
to compensate for this effect.The second and third ways to get the geometry of a window are to use
XGetGeometry() or to get all the window attributes using
ID="IX-1002-3-81"XGetGeometryXGetWindowAttributes().  The difference between these two routines
ID="IX-1002-3-82"XGetWindowAttributes
is that XGetWindowAttributes() gets much more information and
actually calls XGetGeometry() itself.  These methods have the
disadvantage that they get information from the server, requiring a
round-trip request that is subject to network delays.  We show this
method here because, for any window other than the root window, this
is the only way to get window information.The following code fragments demonstrate the three ways of getting
root window information.  basicwin uses the macros method
because, in this case, we need information about the root window,
and this is the most efficient way to get it.Example 3-3 shows the macros method; Example 3-4,
the XGetGeometry() method; and Example 3-5,
the XGetWindowAttributes() method.

position relative to its parent is determined as the window is
created, since these coordinates are specified as arguments to
the routine that creates the window.The basicwin application has only one window.  Creating the
first window of an application is a special case, because that
window is a child of the root window and, therefore, is subject
to management by the window manager.  An application can suggest
a position for this window, but it is very likely to be ignored.
Most window managers allow the user to position the window as it
appears on the screen.  So most simple applications create the
first window with its position set to (0,0).
Example 3-6 shows the simplest call to create a window.In LINKEND="CH-1002-14-1"Chapter 14, "A Complete Application," we will show you a more complete approach
that processes command line arguments to get the position of the
top-level window.  When the user specifies a position, there is a
technique for making sure that the window manager will honor the position.

XCreateSimpleWindowexampleThe only new thing in Example 3-6 is the use of several
new macros in the call to create a window.Let's talk about the RootWindow() macro.  Each screen has
its own root window.  To create the first of your application's
windows on a particular screen, you use the root window on that
screen as the parent.  That window can then only be used on that
screen.  The ID of the root window on a particular screen is
returned by the RootWindow() macro.  The first generation
ID="IX-1002-3-86"RootWindow macroID="IX-1002-3-87"macrosRootWindow
of windows on a screen (known as the top-level windows) should always
use this macro to specify the parent.  XCreateSimpleWindow()
makes a new window given arguments for specifying it parent, size,
position, border width, border pixel value, and background pixel
value.  All other attributes of the window are taken from the parent,
in this case the root window.  If we wanted to specify any or all
the attributes instead of inheriting them from the parent, we would
have to use XCreateWindow() instead of XCreateSimpleWindow().

ID="IX-1002-3-97"BlackPixel macroID="IX-1002-3-98"macrosBlackPixel
also set to BlackPixel().  The background and border pixel
values are set with the last two arguments of XCreateSimpleWindow().
The foreground pixel value is set in the get_GC routine in
the manner described in LINKEND="S1-1002-5-1"Section 5.1, "Creating and Setting a Graphics Context."As you may recall from LINKEND="CH-1002-2-1"Chapter 2, "X Concepts," pixel values represent
colors, but they will be translated by a colormap before being
displayed on the screen.  BlackPixel() and WhitePixel()
return the pixel values corresponding to two contrasting colors in
the default colormap, which might not actually be black and white.Every application should be made to work in monochrome, because many
people have only monochrome screens.

icon will be recognizable as belonging to the particular application.
Exactly how to tell the window manager about this pixmap will be described
in the next section, but first let's talk about how to create the pixmap.The program should take two steps in creating the pixmap:  it should
find out what sizes of icon are acceptable to the window manager and
then create a pixmap of an appropriate size.  Since most current
window managers do not specify icon sizes, and it is difficult to
know how to respond in a reasonable way, this issue can be ignored
for the present.  Eventually, when standard window managers specify
standard icon sizes, applications would use XGetIconSizes()ID="IX-1002-3-102"XGetIconSizesexample
to determine which window manager was in operation and have a icon
bitmap for each one.Example 3-7 shows the simple process of creating a pixmap for the icon.ID="EX-1002-3-7"basicwin -- creating an icon pixmap#include "bitmaps/icon_bitmap"

symbolic representation of the application, so use your imagination.

application must set the standard properties to tell the window
manager at least a few essential things about the application.You may remember from LINKEND="CH-1002-2-1"Chapter 2, "X Concepts," that a property is
a collection of information that is readable and writable by any
client and is usually used to communicate between clients.  The
standard properties are part of the convention for communication
between each application and the window manager.You may also remember that a property is associated with a particular
window.  The standard properties are associated with the top-level
window of the application.  This is how the server keeps track of
the standard properties of all the different applications and has
them ready for the window manager to read them.Several routines are provided that allow the application to easily
set these properties; analogous routines allow the window manager
to read them.  The routine designed to set all the most important
properties for a normal application is

A hint is information that might or might not be used.  There
may be no window manager running, or the window manager may
ignore some or all of the hints.  Therefore, an application
should not depend on anything having been done with the
information provided in the standard properties.  For example,
take the window name hint.  Some window managers will use this
information to display a titlebar above or beside each top-level
window, showing the application's name.  The proper and obvious
thing for the application to do would be to set the window name
to be the application's name.  But if the application were an
editor, it could try to set its window name to the name of the
current file.  This plan would fall through if no window manager
were running.ID="IX-1002-3-117"icon namesID="IX-1002-3-118"iconspixmap
The icon name and icon pixmap should both set to allow the window
manager to use either or both.  Most current window managers often
display just the icon pixmap, unless no pixmap is specified, in
which case they use the icon name.  If the icon name is not set,
the convention within window managers is to use the window name
as the icon name; if the window name is not specified either,
then they will use the first element of the command line.ID="IX-1002-3-119"command-line argumentsas hintID="IX-1002-3-120"shell commandsas hint
The UNIX shell command name and arguments are passed into main
in the standard fashion from the command line, as argv and
argc.  These can be used directly as arguments in the call
to set the standard properties.  This information might be used by
the session manager to restart or duplicate the application when so
instructed by the user.ID="IX-1002-3-121"size hintsID="IX-1002-3-122"hintssize
And last but not least, the window size hints property
is a structure that specifies the sizes, positions, and aspect

} XSizeHints;You might ask, "How would the user be involved in specifying the
size hints when they have to be set even before a window appears?"The answer:  applications can be written to let the user specify
the position and size of the top-level window through command line
arguments or the resource database.

A more complete application would get these values, use them to
set the size of the window.
To tell the window manager that the user, not the
application, supplied these values, the application would set the
flags field to USSize | USPosition instead of
PSize | PPosition.All this arranges a priority for the different settings of the
position and size of a top-level window.  The lowest priority
is the application itself.  Next higher is the window manager,
and highest of all is the user.  In Example 3-9, the
symbols used to set flags are PSize and
PMinSize.  These indicate that the program is specifying
its desired size and its minimum useful size.  The symbols used for
other members of XSizeHints are shown on the reference page
for XSetWMProperties() in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.ID="IX-1002-3-128"XSizeHints structureLet's describe the other members of XSizeHints.  The
x, y, width, and height members
are simply the desired position and size for the window.
In R4 and later, these fields should not be set.The rest of the size hints give the window manager information
about how to resize the window.  The min_height and
min_width fields should be set to the minimum dimensions
(in pixels) required so that the application can still function
normally.  Many window managers will not allow the user to resize
the window smaller than min_width and min_height.
max_width and max_height are analogous to
min_width and min_height but are less critical
for most applications.ID="IX-1002-3-129"XSizeHints structurefields added in R4In R4, the base_width and base_height fields
have been added to the XSizeHints structure.  They are
used with the width_inc and height_inc fields
to indicate to the window manager that it should resize the
window in steps--in units of a certain number of pixels
instead of single pixels.  The window manager resizes the
window to any multiple of width_inc in width and
height_inc in height, but no smaller than min_width
and min_height and no bigger than max_width and
max_height.  If you think about it, min_width and
min_height and base_width and base_height
have basically the same purpose.  Therefore,
base_width and base_height take priority over
min_width and min_height, so only one of these pairs
should be set.ID="IX-1002-3-130"size incrementswindowID="IX-1002-3-131"windowssize increments
The xterm application provides a good example of size increments.
It wants its window to be resized in multiples of the font width and
height, since it uses only constant-width fonts.  This way, there are
no partial characters along the edges of the window.  What's more, the
application can then interpret dimensions specified by the user in
ID="IX-1002-3-132"width_inc size hintID="IX-1002-3-133"height_inc size hintID="IX-1002-3-134"size hintswidth_incID="IX-1002-3-135"size hintsheight_inc
multiples of width_inc and height_inc, instead of pixels.
The user specifies dimensions in characters (24 by 80 for a standard
size terminal), which the application then translates into pixels by
multiplying them by width_inc and height_inc.  Most
window managers display the dimensions of the window when the user is
resizing it, and if width_inc and height_inc are set,
they will use multiples instead of pixels as units.In R4, the win_gravity field has also been added to
ID="IX-1002-3-136"XSizeHints structurefields added in R4
the XSizeHints structure.  This field suggests to the
window manager how the window should be placed when mapped or,
more accurately, how the position for the window specified by
the user should be interpreted.  Normally, when the user
specifies a position, either by clicking a pointer button to
position a window or through command line arguments, the window
manager places the top-left corner of the application's top-level
window at that point.  The win_gravity field requests the
window manager to place a different part of the window at that
point.  The values of this field are Center, East,
North, NorthEast, NorthWest, South,
SouthEast,  SouthWest, and West.  These
refer to a corner or edge of the window that should be placed at
the specified point.  As mentioned, the default is NorthWest,
which positions the top-left corner of the window at the specified
point.  Few applications need to use this feature.

Our simple program must receive events for three reasons:  to redraw
itself in case of exposure, to recalculate its contents when it is
resized, and to receive a button or key press indicating that the
user is finished with the application.The program must select these types of events specifically since,
by default, it will not receive the kinds of input it needs.
Example 3-11 shows the line of code that selects events.
ID="IX-1002-3-140"selecting eventsexample ofID="EX-1002-03-11"basicwin -- selecting desired event types/* Select event types wanted */
XSelectInput(display, win, ExposureMask | KeyPressMask |
   ButtonPressMask | StructureNotifyMask);ID="IX-1002-3-141"XSelectInputexampleThe crucial argument of XSelectInput() is the event mask.
Each symbol used here selects one of more event types.  The
event mask constants are combined with a bitwise OR since they
are really setting bits in a single argument.ExposureMask selects Expose events, which occur
when the window is first displayed and whenever it becomes visible
after being obscured.  Expose events signal that the
application should redraw itself.X provides separate events for depressing and releasing both
keyboard keys and pointer buttons and separate symbols for
selecting each of these types of events.  KeyPressMask
selects only KeyPress events, and ButtonPressMask
selects only ButtonPress events.  ButtonRelease
and KeyRelease events can also be selected with
ButtonReleaseMask and KeyReleaseMask, but they
are not needed in this application.ID="IX-1002-3-142"StructureNotifyMaskStructureNotifyMask selects a number of event types,
specifically CirculateNotify, ConfigureNotify,
DestroyNotify, GravityNotify, MapNotify,
ReparentNotify, and UnmapNotify.  The only one
of these we need for our application is ConfigureNotify,
ID="IX-1002-3-143"ConfigureNotify eventreason for using
which informs the application of its window's new size when it
has been resized.  However, there is no way to select just this
one event type.  We could get away without selecting this event
type, but any real application would use it because it allows
an increase in performance.  Without this event type, on every
Expose event the application would have to use
XGetGeometry() to find out its current size.  This is a
ID="IX-1002-3-144"XGetGeometry
request that requires a reply from the server and therefore is
subject to network delays.The rest of the event types selected by StructureNotifyMask
are described in LINKEND="CH-1002-8-1"Chapter 8, "Events."ID="IX-1002-3-145"XSelectInputXSelectInput() actually sets the event_mask attribute
of the window.  If you create the window with XCreateWindow()
(as opposed to XCreateSimpleWindow()), you can select events
at the same time by setting the event_mask attribute in the
last two arguments of the call.  This is slightly more efficient
than calling XSelectInput() separately.  You can also set
this attribute through XChangeWindowAttributes() if, for
some other reason, you need to call this function anyway.ID="S2-1002-3-10"Creating Server ResourcesID="IX-1002-3-146"resourcescreatingThe next step in the application is to create any other server
resources that are needed.  Server resources are collections
of information managed by the server and referred to in the
application by an ID number.
ID="IX-1002-3-147"resourcesColormapID="IX-1002-3-148"resourcesCursorID="IX-1002-3-149"resourcesFontID="IX-1002-3-150"resourcesgraphics contextID="IX-1002-3-151"resourcesPixmapID="IX-1002-3-152"resourcesWindow
Items with the types Colormap, Cursor, Font,
GC, Pixmap, and Window are server resources.
They should be created once and the ID kept rather than creating
and deleting them in frequently called subroutines.  That is why
they are normally created in main or in a subroutine called
only once from main.In this program, we have already created two resources:  a window
and the icon pixmap.  We still need to load a font for the text
and to create a graphics context to draw both text and graphics
into the window.  These operations are done in the routines
load_font and get_GC, called just before mapping
the window.  We are going to delay describing these routines until
Chapters 5, The Graphics Context and 6, Drawing Graphics and Text, in order to keep this chapter to
manageable proportions.  However, the complete code for basicwin,
including these functions, is listed at the end of this chapter, in
case you want a sneak preview.ID="S2-1002-3-11"Window MappingID="IX-1002-3-153"mappingwindowID="IX-1002-3-154"XMapWindowID="IX-1002-3-155"windowsmappingFinally we are ready to display the window.  Note that we have done
all that preparation before mapping the window for good reason.  The
window manager hints must be set so that the window manager can handle
the mapping properly, and events must be selected so that the first
Expose will arrive and tell the application to draw into its window.Example 3-12 shows the code that maps the window.ID="EX-1002-03-12"basicwin -- mapping the window/* Display window */
XMapWindow(display, win);
XMapWindowexampleID="IX-1002-3-156"basicwin programmapping windowYou may remember from LINKEND="CH-1002-2-1"Chapter 2, "X Concepts," that in order for a
window to be visible, it must meet five conditions.  These are so
important that they bear repeating:
ID="IX-1002-3-157"windowvisibilityID="IX-1002-3-158"visibilityconditions forNUMERATION="ARABIC"ID="IX-1002-3-159"XMapWindowThe window must be mapped with XMapWindow() or related routines.All its ancestors must be mapped.  This condition is always satisfied
for the children of the root window, the top-level windows of each
application.The window must not be obscured by visible sibling windows or their
ancestors--this depends on the stacking order.  When first mapped,
a window appears on top of its siblings, which will be on top of all
windows if its parent is the root window.The request buffer must be flushed.  This topic will be described in
the next section.
ID="IX-1002-3-160"XFlushThe initial mapping of a top-level window is a special case, since
the window's visibility may be delayed by the window manager.  For
complicated reasons, an application must wait for the first
Expose event before assuming that its window is visible
and drawing into it.ID="S2-1002-3-12"Flushing the Output BufferID="IX-1002-3-161"flushingoutput bufferID="IX-1002-3-162"XFlushXMapWindow() causes an X protocol request that instructs the
ID="IX-1002-3-163"XMapWindow
server to display the window on the screen.  Like all other X protocol
requests, this one is queued until an event-reading routine such as
XNextEvent(), a routine that queries the server (most routines
ID="IX-1002-3-164"XNextEvent
whose names contain Fetch, Get, or Query), or
a routine such as XFlush() or XSync() is called.  The
server operates more efficiently over the network when X protocol
requests are sent in groups.
ID="IX-1002-3-165"XSyncThe XNextEvent() call performs the flushing frequently enough
in applications that take user input.  The routines that query the
server should be called as infrequently as possible because they reduce
performance over the network.  The XFlush() command instructs
ID="IX-1002-3-166"XFlush
the server to process all queued output requests right away.
XFlush() is generally necessary only when an application needs
to draw periodically even without user input.ID="S2-1002-3-13"Setting Up an Event-gathering LoopID="IX-1002-3-167" SPAN="START"eventshandlingID="IX-1002-3-168"windowsexposureID="IX-1002-3-169"exposure handlingX programs are event-driven, which means that after setting up all the
server resources and window manager hints as described up to this point,
the program performs all further actions only in response to events.
The event-gathering loop is the standard way to respond to events,
performing the appropriate action depending on the type of event
and the information contained in the event structure.The event loop is normally a closed loop, in which one of the event
types with certain contents defined by the application indicates that
ID="IX-1002-3-170"xclock
the user wants to exit.  In some existing applications such as xclock,
the loop is completely closed, and therefore the only way to terminate the
program is to find the process ID from the shell and kill it or use the
window or session manager, but this can be inconvenient.The choice of which events are received by the application was made
earlier when the application selected input or set the event_mask
attribute.  The event loop must make sure to properly handle every event
type selected.  One of the most common debugging problems is for there to
be a difference between the events handled and those selected.Have a look at the code in Example 3-13, before
we describe it in more specific terms.ID="EX-1002-03-13"basicwin -- processing events  .

inside the top of the loop is the XNextEvent() statement,
ID="IX-1002-3-171"XNextEventexample
which gets an event structure from the queue Xlib maintains
for the application and puts the pointer to it in the variable
report.  You might assume that the event loop could
have been written:ID="SC-1002-3-5"while (XNextEvent(display, &event)) {

}but this is not the case.  XNextEvent() returns void; it
ID="IX-1002-3-172"eventsloops for getting
only returns when there is an event to return.  Errors are handled
through a separate error-handling mechanism, not through the returned

    XNextEvent(display, &event);
  .
  .
  .
}Right after XNextEvent() is a switch statement that branches
depending on the event type.  There is one case for each of the
four types of events:  ButtonPress, ConfigureNotify,
Expose, and KeyPress.The ConfigureNotify branch, in all applications, will
calculate the values of variables based on the new window size.
These variable values will then be used to calculate where to
draw things in the Expose branch the next time an
Expose event occurs.  A ConfigureNotify event
is always followed by one or more Expose events.ID="S3-1002-3-1"Repainting the WindowID="IX-1002-3-173"exposure handlingID="IX-1002-3-174" SPAN="START"windowsrepaintingID="IX-1002-3-175" SPAN="START"repaint strategyID="IX-1002-3-176"drawingwindows;repaint strategyExpose events occur when a window becomes visible on the
screen, after being obscured or unmapped.  They occur because the
X Window System does not normally save the contents of regions of
windows obscured by other windows or not mapped.  The contents of
windows need to be redrawn when they are exposed.ID="IX-1002-3-177"Expose eventID="IX-1002-3-178"eventsExpose
The code for Expose events draws or redraws the contents
of the application's window.  This code will be reached when the
window is first mapped, and whenever a portion of the window
becomes visible.An application can respond to Expose events by refreshing
only the parts of the window exposed, or by refreshing the entire
window.  The former is possible because the event structure for
each Expose event carries the position and dimensions of
a single rectangular exposed area, as shown in Example 3-14.ID="EX-1002-03-14"The XExposeEvent structuretypedef struct {

manager operation, as shown in Figure 3-2.  If window E
were raised, four Expose events would be sent to it.  The
height and width members in each event structure
would correspond to the dimensions of the area where each of the
windows overlapped window E, and the x and y
members would specify the upper-left corner of each area relative
to the origin of window E.  All the Expose events

exposed parts depends on the complexity of the drawing in the
window.  If all of the window contents are simple for both the
application and the server to draw, the entire window contents
can be redrawn without a performance problem.  This approach works
well as long as the window is only redrawn once, even if multiple
Expose events occur because of a single user action.  One
trick is to monitor the count member of the Expose
event structure and ignore the Expose events (do not redraw
the window) until this member is 0.  It might seem an even
better method to search the entire queue, removing all Expose
events that occurred on the window, before redrawing.  But this is
illegal because there may be intervening ConfigureNotify events
in the queue, and responding to an Expose event that follows
a ConfigureNotify event too early will result in redrawing
the wrong area or not redrawing at the right time.  Only contiguousExpose events can be skipped.ID="IX-1002-3-182"repaint strategyefficiency inOn the other hand, if a window has any elements that can be
time consuming for either the application or the server to
redraw, then the application should only redraw the time-consuming
elements if they are actually within the exposed areas.ID="IX-1002-3-183"redrawingtime in repaint strategyID="IX-1002-3-184"serversdrawing time
The issue here is redrawing time, which has two components under
the application's control:  the time the application takes to
process the redrawing instructions, and the time it takes for
the server to actually do the redrawing.  On most servers, a user
must wait for the server to complete drawing before he or she can
move the pointer or go on to other actions.  Therefore, the time
taken by the server is critical, since it translates directly
into waiting by the user.  Since the system running X clients is
normally multitasking, the time taken by the application to minimize
redrawing is not as important, since the user can still do work.There are two approaches to assisting the server in redrawing exposed
regions quickly.  One is to avoid redrawing items in regions that have not
been exposed.  Doing this in an application requires identifying any items
to be drawn that do not extend into any of the exposed areas and eliminating
these drawing requests.  There are a set of routines that perform intersecting
calculations on regions that may help you implement this.ID="IX-1002-3-185"optimizing performanceredrawingThe second approach is to set the clip mask in the GC to draw only in
the exposed areas.  This second approach is much simpler in code, but it
delegates the job of eliminating unnecessary drawing to the server.  Many
servers may not do this elimination, because there is again a tradeoff
between the time saved in eliminating requests and the time spent in
calculating which requests to eliminate.If you are now confused and wondering which redrawing approach
to take in your application, the general rules should be as follows:
ID="IX-1002-3-186"drawingwindowsMARK="BULLET"If the window is fast to draw, the whole window can be drawn in
response to the last Expose event in a contiguous series;
this means drawing only when count is zero.  The definition
of fast will vary from server to server, but anything that
uses the more complex features of the GC, such as wide lines or
join styles, or that may have lots of drawing requests should
probably be considered slow.For windows that are slow to draw, the application should avoid
drawing areas that were not exposed.  If the application can figure
out which slow drawing requests would draw only into areas that were
not exposed and these calculations are not time consuming in themselves,
then it should eliminate these requests.ID="IX-1002-3-187"exposure handlingapproaches toFor windows that are slow to draw, the second best approach is to set
a clip mask to allow the server to eliminate unnecessary requests.
(This will work only if the server has been designed to do so.)  The
application can combine all the areas in a contiguous series of expose
events into a single clip mask and set this clip mask into the GC.
The code for this is only slightly more complex than the approach
for the window that is fast to draw.Since the image used by the basicwin application is simple,
the application can redraw the entire window upon receiving the last
contiguous Expose event with little performance penalty.  But
we will also show you the other approach, as if the window were more
complex.  Example 3-13 shows the first method from the list
above, and Example 3-15 shows the third method.The second method in the list above is not shown here because it
is hard to demonstrate in a way that is transferable to other
applications.  We will just describe it in a little more detail
instead.  Let's say that we are writing a spreadsheet application
and designing the exposure event handling.  In the spreadsheet, it
would be easy to determine which cells were affected by the exposure,
because the cells are arranged along horizontal rows and in columns.
Upon getting an Expose event, the application could easily
determine which cells overlapped the exposed area and then redraw
only those.  The same could not be said of a painting program, in
which some drawing primitives could be diagonal or drawn with weird
line styles.  It would be very hard to determine whether a particular
primitive drawn in the painting program intersects with an exposed
region.  In general, any application that draws most or all of its
graphics horizontally or vertically can benefit from this technique.
One example of an application written this way is xterm, and
you can look at the code for that if you can get it.  xterm
redraws only the characters that are in exposed areas.ID="IX-1002-3-188"repaint strategyexamples ofID="IX-1002-3-189"exposure handlingexamples of
Example 3-15 shows a technique that could be used for more
complicated windows.  It creates a single Region composed
of the union of the rectangles in all the Expose events.
Regions are described fully in LINKEND="CH-1002-6-1"Chapter 6, "Drawing Graphics and Text," but you

for most applications, but for a few applications, it might be
very difficult or impossible.  There is another method that
might be used in such a situation.  The application could draw
into a pixmap and then copy the pixmap to the window each time
the window needs redrawing.  That way the complete window
contents would always be available for redrawing the window on
Expose events.  The disadvantage of this approach is
that the server might not have sufficient memory to store many

pixmaps in memory (especially on color displays) or it might be
slow about copying the pixmap into the window.  But this would be
a logical way to handle exposure in an application that performs
double-buffering.  LINKEND="FN-1002-3-4"ID="IX-1002-3-198"double-bufferingID="FN-1002-3-4"Double-buffering is an animation technique that hides the drawing
process from the viewer.  In one implementation, a pixmap is drawn into

technique called overlays is described in Chapter 7.ID="IX-1002-3-199"backing storein exposure handlingID="IX-1002-3-200"exposure handlingwith backing storeID="IX-1002-3-201"repaint strategyhandling
On high performance graphics workstations, a feature known as
a backing store might also be available to assist in redrawing
windows. When available, this feature can be turned on for any
window that really requires it.  With the backing store on,
the server can maintain the contents of the window when it is
obscured and even when it is unmapped and capture drawing to
the window while it is in one of these states.  The one situation
that the backing store cannot fully take care of is resizing the
window.  This is because it is assumed that most applications need
to recalculate the dimensions of their contents to fit a new window
size.  The application can set an attribute called bit gravity to
retain part of the window during a resize, but part of the window
is still going to need redrawing if the window is resized larger.In case you might be wondering, we have intentionally not described
the draw_text and draw_graphics routines here.  They
are described in Sections 6.2.7 and 6.1.3.  But if you

to draw into its windows.  You might think it would work to draw
immediately after the XMapWindow() request that displays a
window on the screen.  But that will not work with most styles
of window manager.  The rule is that no drawing is allowed until the
first Expose event arrives.The reason involves a feature of X called substructure redirection,
ID="IX-1002-3-207"substructure redirection
introduced in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-5"Section 2.1.5, "The Window Manager" and described more fully
in LINKEND="S1-1002-16-2"Section 16.2, "Substructure Redirection."ID="S2-1002-3-15"When Will My Drawing Appear?ID="IX-1002-3-208"outputqueueID="IX-1002-3-209"queueoutputID="IX-1002-3-210"XFlushID="IX-1002-3-211"queryingthe serverID="IX-1002-3-212"graphicswhen they appearID="IX-1002-3-213"bufferingaffect on screenAnother characteristic of X that often confuses newcomers is
the fact that graphics drawn may not appear on the screen
immediately.  It is easy to write a program that properly
performs a number of drawing calls but that never makes
anything appear on the screen.  This is a side effect of the
fact that X is designed to buffer communications over a network,
as was described in theoretical terms in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-2"Section 2.1.2, "Buffering."
We will describe it in more practical terms here.What happens is that the requests (to create windows, to map
windows, or to draw into them) are queued up in Xlib, waiting
for something to happen that requires an immediate communication
with the server.  Xlib will not send requests of any kind to the
server until such an occurrence.  The requests are saved up as a
packet so they can be sent over the network more efficiently.The queue of requests waiting to be sent to the server is called
the request buffer.  The requests are accumulated in the
ID="IX-1002-3-214"request buffer
request buffer until a call to:NUMERATION="ARABIC"Any routine which requests information from the X server
(for example, XGetWindowAttributes(),
XLoadQueryFont(), XQueryPointer())
ID="IX-1002-3-215"XGetWindowAttributesID="IX-1002-3-216"XLoadQueryFontID="IX-1002-3-217"XQueryPointerCertain requests for getting events (XMaskEvent(),
XNextEvent(), XPending(), XWindowEvent)
ID="IX-1002-3-218"XMaskEventID="IX-1002-3-219"XNextEventID="IX-1002-3-220"XPendingID="IX-1002-3-221"XWindowEventXFlush()ID="IX-1002-3-222"XFlushXSync()ID="IX-1002-3-223"XSyncID="IX-1002-3-224"outputnot visibleActually, a routine in number 2 above that gets events triggers a
communication with the server only if there is no event on Xlib's
event queue that matches what the routine is looking for.  Only if
the routines are waiting for an event do they trigger the exchange.
Any of these actions is said to flush the request buffer,
ID="IX-1002-3-225"flushingrequest buffer
which means that all requests up to this point will be acted on
by the server.  Novice programmers who neglect to call one of
these routines will notice that their drawing requests have not
been honored.  They do not realize that perhaps none of
their X requests that require communication with the server
have been honored.But does it really take a lot of care to make sure that the
request buffer gets flushed?  Not usually.  Since X programs are
event-driven, they often call routines that get events.  If an
application handles event types that occur frequently, such as
pointer or keyboard events, there is nothing to worry about.  If
the application needs to get information from the server by making
a call containing the word Fetch, Get, or Query,
no problem is likely.  On the other hand, an output-only application
that handles only Expose events would certainly need to call
XFlush() once in a while to make sure that its drawing was
honored in a timely fashion.ID="S2-1002-3-16"Handling Resizing of the WindowID="IX-1002-3-226"resize handlingID="IX-1002-3-227"windowsresizingID="IX-1002-3-228"sizechangesID="IX-1002-3-229"ConfigureNotify eventID="IX-1002-3-230"eventsConfigureNotifyThe ConfigureNotify event tells the application that the
window was resized.  In this program, we pass this information to
the routines that draw, so that they can position things properly.
We also see if the new size is less than the minimum useful size
that we set as a size hint for the window manager.  If it is smaller
in either dimension, then we set the flag window_size so that
the next time an Expose event arrives, we display the message
ID="IX-1002-3-231"minimum size of application
"Too Small" instead of the usual text.Example 3-16 shows the code that handles the
ConfigureNotify event.

case ConfigureNotify:
   /* Window has been resized; change width and height to
    * send to place_text and place_graphics in next Expose */
   width = report.xconfigure.width;
   height = report.xconfigure.height;
   if ((width < size_hints->min_width) ||
         (height < size_hints->min_height))
      window_size = TOO_SMALL;
   else
      window_size = BIG_ENOUGH;
   break;
  .
  .
  .Note that when the window is first mapped, the ConfigureNotify
event appears on the queue before the first Expose
event.  This means that the code works even if the window manager
modifies the window's size before allowing it to be displayed.
The initial ConfigureNotify updates the application's
knowledge of the window size, and the following Expose
event allows the application to draw the window's contents.ID="IX-1002-3-234"ConfigureNotify eventorder with ExposeID="IX-1002-3-235"resize handlingwith and without ConfigureNotify
If we had not selected ConfigureNotify events, the
code for Expose would have to be modified to check the
dimensions in the first Expose event, so that it knew
the correct window size.  It would also have to query the server
for the window size in response to subsequent Expose
events, because these events describe only the exposed area,
not the entire window.

very demanding use of KeyPress and ButtonPress
events.  For a description of how to use keyboard and pointer
events for more advanced purposes, see LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer."To cleanly exit, a client should free all the memory it has allocated,
particularly X resources, and then close the display connection with
XCloseDisplay().  Example 3-17 shows the code that
performs these functions in basicwin.ID="EX-1002-03-17"Closing the display connection and freeing resourcescase ButtonPress:

        exit(1);ID="IX-1002-3-240"XCloseDisplayexampleIt is good practice to use XCloseDisplay() even though
the connection to the server is closed automatically when a
process exits.  Otherwise, pending errors might not be reported.ID="S2-1002-3-18"Error HandlingID="IX-1002-3-241"error handlingAlthough there does not appear to be much in the way of
error-handling code in this example, the question of error
handling has been fully considered:MARK="BULLET"On the XOpenDisplay() call, we check for the error return,
ID="IX-1002-3-242"XOpenDisplay
tell the user what server the attempt was made to connect to,
and exit gracefully.For all other errors, we depend on the default error-handling
mechanisms.  These errors might be a protocol errors caused by
a programming error (all of which we hope to eliminate), a protocol
error caused by the server running out of memory (the chance of
which we cannot eliminate), or an IO error such as losing the
connection with the server due to network failure.  For protocol
errors, the client gets an error event from the server, and Xlib
invokes an error handler function.  The client is free to provide
its own error handler to replace the default handler, which prints
an informative message and exits.  For IO errors, there is a separate
error handler function, which can be separately replaced by the
application.  But for this example, we have simply relied on the
default handlers.It is important to note that not all protocol errors cause the
error handler to be invoked, though this fact does not show
itself in basicwin.  Some errors, such as failure to open
a font, are indicated by returned values of type Status
on the appropriate routine (in this case, XLoadFont()).
The returned values are zero on failure and nonzero on success.
In general, any routine that returns Status will need
its return value tested, because it will have bypassed the
ID="IX-1002-3-243"Status return valuesID="IX-1002-3-244"return valueStatus
error-handling mechanism.ID="S2-1002-3-19"SummaryThe basic steps that were taken in this program are as follows:
ID="IX-1002-3-245"ordercode stepsMARK="BULLET"Open connection to server.Make sure connection succeeded, print error and exit if not.Get display dimensions.Calculate desired size of window and create window.Create pixmap for icon.Initialize XSizeHint structure.Set standard properties for window manager.Select desired event types.Map window.Set up event gathering loop.If event is of type Expose, draw contents of window.If event is of type ConfigureNotify, recalculate
dimensions of window.If event is ButtonPress or KeyPress, close
the display and exit.The order of these steps is important up to the point where the
window is mapped.  Within the event loop, the order of events
cannot be completely predicted.ID="S2-1002-3-20"Complete Code for basicwinNow look at the complete code for basicwin and make sure

introduced in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-6"Section 2.2.1, "Window Characteristics" and described in more detail
in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-15"Section 2.4.1, "Window Attributes."  You should read those sections before
proceeding.The setting of window attributes becomes necessary when
you use XCreateWindow() instead of the simpler
XCreateSimpleWindow().  However, it is not essential
that you set any window attributes other than the window
background and border.  Therefore, this chapter is mainly
about optional features that you may find useful.You will continue to find this chapter useful
as a reference even when you are an experienced X programmer.
A useful quick reference to the window attributes is also
provided inside the back cover of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.ID="S1-1002-4-1"Setting Window AttributesID="IX-1002-4-2"attributessettingID="IX-1002-4-3"attributessettingID="IX-1002-4-4"window attributessettingID="IX-1002-4-5"XCreateWindowID="IX-1002-4-6"XChangeWindowAttributesWindow attributes can be set while creating a window with
XCreateWindow() or afterward with a call to
XChangeWindowAttributes().  When creating a window
with XCreateSimpleWindow(), most of the attributes are inherited

from the parent.  There are also several routines for changing
individual window attributes, including the event_mask,

XCreateWindow() or XChangeWindowAttributes().

XWindowAttributes is a read-only structure that
contains all the attributes, while XSetWindowAttributes is
a structure that contains only those attributes that a program is
allowed to set.  We will not show you XWindowAttributes
until LINKEND="S1-1002-4-4"Section 4.4, "Information from the XWindowAttributes Structure," since it is used in programming only for

These and a few other attributes have routines for setting them
individually.  (These routines are referred to as convenience
routines.  They are provided for the attributes that most
often need to be set without modifying any other attributes.)
Table 4-2 lists the attributes that can be set individually
and the routines that set them.  But it is important to realize
that each of these routines would generate a separate protocol
request to the server, so if more than one attribute is to be
set, it is more efficient to use the procedures shown above in
Examples 4-2 and 4-3.

values for each member of the XSetWindowAttributes
structure.  The attributes control a wide variety of ways
for a window to act.  They can be grouped loosely to help
you understand when you might want to set each attribute.One group of attributes controls the appearance of a window.
These are background_pixel, background_pixmap,
border_pixel, border_ pixmap, colormap,
and cursor.  Most clients will set the border,
background, and cursor but use the default colormap.A second group is provided to allow clients to improve
their redrawing performance under certain conditions.
These are backing_pixel, backing_planes,
backing_store, bit_gravity, and
save_under.  These attributes do not affect the
appearance or operation of a client.  It is advisable to
consider bit_gravity when designing a client, but
the code for using these attributes can be added after a
client's functionality is complete.The event_mask and do_not_propagate_mask
attributes control the selection and propagation of events.
These attributes are described briefly in this chapter but
also in much more detail in LINKEND="CH-1002-8-1"Chapter 8, "Events."The win_gravity attribute provides a means for relocating
a window automatically when its parent is resized.  Applications
can take advantage of this feature to simplify the code that
positions their subwindows when they are resized.The override_redirect attribute controls whether requests
to map or reconfigure the window can be intercepted by the window
manager.  override_redirect is meant to be set for the most
temporary types of windows such as pop-up menus.  In practice, this
attribute only affects the top-level windows of an application
(all children of the root window).As described in Chapter 2, there are two window classes:
InputOutput and InputOnly.  The class of a window is
specified in the call to XCreateWindow(), or is InputOutput
if the window is created with XCreateSimpleWindow().InputOutput windows have all of the attributes described
in the sections below.  InputOnly windows have only the
following subset of attributes:

InputOnly window will cause an X protocol error (BadMatch).ID="S2-1002-4-1"The Window BackgroundID="IX-1002-4-31"backgroundspecifyingID="IX-1002-4-32"windowsbackgroundThe background of a window is the drawing surface on which
other graphics are drawn.  It may be a solid color, or it may be
patterned with a pixmap.  This choice is mostly an aesthetic
decision for the programmer.  However, users expect to be able
to specify the background color on the command line or in the
resource database.  Therefore, if a pixmap is used, the code for
creating the pixmap should use two colors specified by the user (see
LINKEND="S2-1002-6-5"Section 6.1.5, "Creating Bitmaps, Pixmaps, Tiles, and Stipples" for information on creating pixmaps).The two attributes that control the background are
background_pixmap and background_pixel,
set by XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap() and
XSetWindowBackground(), respectively.These two attributes are not independent since they affect
the same pixels.  Either attribute can take precedence over
the other, the winner being the one that is set last.  If
both are set in the same call to XCreateWindow() or
XChangeWindowAttributes(), the background_pixel
value is used.The background of exposed areas of windows is automatically
repainted by the server, regardless of whether the application
selects Expose events.However, changes in background attributes will not take effect
until the server generates the next Expose event on that
window.  If you want the new background to be visible immediately,
call XClearWindow() and flush the request buffer with
XFlush().Applications must set one or the other for all windows.  Otherwise,
the results are undefined.  Most applications set backgrounds to
a solid color by setting the background_pixel attribute.
The easiest way to do this is by setting the last argument of
XCreateSimpleWindow() to BlackPixel or WhitePixel().ID="S3-1002-4-1"background_pixmapID="IX-1002-4-33"XSetWindowBackgroundPixmapID="IX-1002-4-34"background_pixmap attributeID="IX-1002-4-35"attributesbackground_pixmapIf the background is set to a pixmap, the background is tiled
with the pixmap. Tiling is the laying out of a pixmap to cover
an area.  The first pixmap is applied at the origin of the window
(or its parent's origin if using the parent's background pixmap by
specifying ParentRelative, as described below).  Another
copy of the same pixmap is applied next to that one and another below
it and so on until the window is filled.The pixmap may be any size, though some sizes may be tiled faster
than others.  To find the most efficient tile size for a particular
screen, call XQueryBestTile().
ID="IX-1002-4-36"XQueryBestTileA pixmap must be created with XCreatePixmap() or
XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData() before being set as the
ID="IX-1002-4-37"XCreatePixmapbackground_pixmap attribute.  The pixmap must have the
same depth as the window and be created on the same screen.  These
characteristics are assigned to a pixmap as it is created.  (For more
information on creating pixmaps for tiles, see LINKEND="S2-1002-6-5"Section 6.1.5, "Creating Bitmaps, Pixmaps, Tiles, and Stipples.")The background_pixmap attribute has the following possible values:None (default)ID="IX-1002-4-38"Nonebackground_pixmapSpecifies that the window has no defined background pixmap.
The window background initially will be invisible and will share the
bits of its parent but only if the background_pixel
attribute is not set.  When anything is drawn by any client
into the area enclosed by the window, the contents will remain
until the area is explicitly cleared with XClearWindow().
The background is not automatically refreshed after exposure.
The main purpose of the setting None is a minor performance
improvement.  If the application is simply going to cover the entire
window with graphics (i.e., there is no reasonable "background" that
the application can set), then why bother forcing the server to spend
time painting the background?  None might also be useful for a
subwindow when that subwindow will never be moved in relation to its
parent.a pixmap IDThe background will be tiled with the specified pixmap, but not
until the next Expose event or XClearWindow() call.
The background tile origin is the window origin.  If the pixmap
is not explicitly referenced again, it can be freed, since
a copy is maintained in the server.  Because the server copies the
pixmap, changes to it after you set the background_pixmap
attribute are not guaranteed to be reflected in the window background.
For consistent results, therefore, you need to reset the attribute
after each change to the pixmap.ParentRelativeID="IX-1002-4-39"ParentRelative background_pixmapSpecifies that the parent's background is to be used and that
the origin for tiling is the parent's origin (or the parent's
parent if the parent's background_pixmap attribute is
also ParentRelative and so on).  The difference between
setting ParentRelative and explicitly setting the same
pixmap as the parent is the origin of the tiling.  The difference
between ParentRelative and None is that for
ParentRelative, the background is automatically
repainted on exposure.The window must have the same depth as the parent, or a
BadMatch error will occur.  If the parent has background
None, then the window will also have background None.
The parent's background is re-examined each time the window
background is required (when it needs to be redrawn due to exposure).
The window's contents will be lost when the window is moved relative
to its parent, and the contents will have to be redrawn.Changing the background_pixmap attribute of the root
window to None or ParentRelative restores the
default background, which is server-dependent.By the way, the symbol CopyFromParent is not used for
setting the background, but it will not cause an error, since
its value is the same as None.ID="S3-1002-4-2"background_pixelID="IX-1002-4-40"XSetWindowBackgroundID="IX-1002-4-41"background_pixel attributeID="IX-1002-4-42"attributesbackground_pixelIf the background pixel value is specified, the entire background
will take on the color (or shade of gray) indicated for that pixel
value in the current colormap.LINKEND="FN-1002-4-1"ID="FN-1002-4-1"We should inform you here that a pixel value is not something you
choose yourself; you choose a color name, and the pixel value is
returned to you from BlackPixel or WhitePixel() or
one of the routines that allocate colors.  We go into this subject
in detail in LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color."The background_pixel attribute has the following possible values:undefined (default)Indicates that the background is as specified in the
background_pixmap attribute.  This value is possible
only by creating a window with XCreateWindow() and not
setting the background_pixel attribute.a pixel valueThe background is filled with the specified pixel value.  This
can be set with the last argument of XCreateSimpleWindow(),
XCreateWindow(), or XChangeWindowAttributes().ID="S2-1002-4-2"The Window BorderID="IX-1002-4-43"borderscolor, specifyingID="IX-1002-4-44"borderspattern, specifyingLike the window background, the window border may have a solid
color or may be tiled with a pixmap.  This choice is again up
to the programmer, though the user should be allowed to determine
the color or colors.Unlike changes to the window background, changes to a window's
border attributes are reflected immediately.  No call to
XClearWindow() or call to flush the request buffer is
ID="IX-1002-4-45"XClearWindow
necessary.  This feature makes it possible to use the window
border for indicating a client's state.  But you cannot use
the border of the top-level window, since some window managers
manipulate this border to indicate the keyboard focus window
(see LINKEND="S3-1002-8-1"Section 8.3.2.1, "The Keyboard Focus Window" for a description of the keyboard focus).The design of a pattern for the border will be different from
the background pixmap, because the border width is usually narrow
(at most four pixels).The two attributes that affect the border are border_pixmap
and border_pixel.  XSetWindowBorderPixmap() and
XSetWindowBorder() can be used to set these attributes.
Like the window background, whenever one of these routines is
called, it overrides the previous setting of the border.  If they
are both set simultaneously with XCreateWindow() or
XChangeWindowAttributes(), the border_pixel attribute
takes precedence.Most applications simply set the border_pixel to
BlackPixel or WhitePixel() in the next-to-last
argument of XCreateSimpleWindow().ID="S3-1002-4-3"border_pixmapID="IX-1002-4-46"attributesborder_pixmapID="IX-1002-4-47"border_pixmap attributeID="IX-1002-4-48"XSetWindowBorderPixmapIf the border_pixmap is set to a pixmap, the border
is tiled with the pixmap.  Tiling is performed as described
previously for the background pixmap; the border tile origin
is the same as the background tile origin.The border_pixmap attribute has the following possible values:CopyFromParent (default)ID="IX-1002-4-49"CopyFromParentborder_pixmapSpecifies that the border pixmap is to be copied from the
parent.  (Note that CopyFromParent will cause protocol errors
if the window's depth is different from its parent's.)  Subsequent changes to the parent's border attributes
do not affect the child, but changes to the pixmap used by the
parent may be reflected in the child border (server-dependent).NoneID="IX-1002-4-50"Noneborder_pixmapSpecifies that the window has no border pixmap.  If the window
has no border pixel value either, then it uses the same border
pixel value as the parent.a pixmap IDSpecifies a pixmap to be tiled in the border.  The border tile
origin is always the window origin; it is not taken from the
background tile origin.  If the pixmap is not explicitly
referenced again, it can be freed since a copy is maintained
in the server.For the root window, CopyFromParent indicates that
the default border will be inherited by subsequently created
children of the root window, instead of any other border that
was set for the root window.  Setting the border_pixmap
of the root window to CopyFromParent restores the
default border pixmap for later inheritance.ID="S3-1002-4-4"border_pixelID="IX-1002-4-51"XSetWindowBorderID="IX-1002-4-52"attributesborder_pixelID="IX-1002-4-53"border_pixel attributeIf a border pixel value is specified, the entire border will

border_pixmap attribute.  This value is possible
only by creating a window with XCreateWindow() and
not setting the border_pixel attribute.a pixel valueOverrides the default and any border_pixmap given,

with it, since none of the pixel values need to be changed.
But when a window is enlarged or shrunk, the server has no
idea where in the resulting window the old contents should
be placed, so it normally throws them out.  The bit_gravity
attribute tells the server where to put the existing bits
in the larger or smaller window.  By instructing the server
where to place the old contents, bit gravity allows some
clients (not all can take advantage of it) to avoid redrawing
parts of their windows.ID="IX-1002-4-56"optimizing performancewith bit gravityBit gravity is never necessary in programs.  It does
not affect the appearance or functionality of the client.
It is used to improve performance in certain cases.  Some
X servers may not implement bit gravity and may throw out
the window contents on resizing regardless of the setting of
this attribute.  This response is the default for all servers.
That is, the default bit gravity is ForgetGravity,
which means that the contents of a window are always lost
when the window is resized, even if they are maintained
in backing store or because of a save_under (to
be described in Sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6).The window is tiled with its background in the areas that
are not preserved by the bit gravity, unless no background
is defined, in which case the existing screen is not altered.There is no routine to set the bit_gravity individually;
it can be set only with XChangeWindowAttributes() or
XCreateWindow().The bit_gravity attribute has 11 possible values:ForgetGravity (default)ID="IX-1002-4-57"ForgetGravity bit_gravitySpecifies that window contents should always be discarded
after a size change.  Note that some X servers may not
implement bit gravity and may use ForgetGravity
in all cases.StaticGravityID="IX-1002-4-58"StaticGravity visual classbit_gravitySpecifies that window contents should not move relative to
the origin of the root window.  This means that the area
of intersection between the original extent of the window
and the final extent of the window will not be disturbed.Each constant below specifies where the old window contents
should be placed in the resized window.ID="IX-1002-4-59"compass constantsNorthWestGravityUpper-left corner of the resized window.NorthGravityTop center of the resized window.NorthEastGravityUpper-right corner of the resized window.WestGravityLeft center of the resized window.CenterGravityCenter of the resized window.EastGravityRight center of the resized window.

of bit gravity.  Figure 4-1 shows a fictional application
that draws a two-axis graph in a window, with the origin at the
lower-left corner.  If that window were resized, the application
would want the old contents to be placed against the new lower-left
corner, no matter which sides of the window were moved in or out.
That application would set the bit_gravity attribute of
this window to SouthWestGravity.  Figure 4-1 shows the
response of this window to resizing with this bit gravity setting.ID="FG-1002-4-1"bit_gravity for a graphing applicationFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.4.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-4-3"Each compass constant, such as SouthWestGravity, indicates
the placement of the retained region in the window after resizing.
In this case, the lower-left corner of the existing pixels is
placed against the lower-left corner of the resulting window.  When
an Expose event arrives, the application need only redraw
the two new strips of the window at the top and right side.  No
Expose event will be generated on the area that was saved
because of bit_gravity.For another example, think of a window containing centered text.
If that window were resized either larger or smaller, we would still
like the text to be centered.  In this case, the bit_gravity
should be set to CenterGravity.  Then only if the window is
resized smaller than the length of the text would we have to redraw
the area and only then to break the line or use a shorter message.
We could see whether changing the message would be necessary by
looking at the ConfigureNotify event that occurs as a result
of the resize (see basicwin in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program").
The window would still have to be redrawn if it were obscured
and then exposed, of course--bit gravity only saves some
of the redrawing that would otherwise have to be done.If the constant were NorthGravity, the top center of
the pixels in the window before the resize would be placed
against the top center of the resulting window.  This would
be appropriate if we had a line of text centered at the top
of the window that we wished to preserve when possible.ID="S2-1002-4-4"Window GravityThe win_gravity attribute controls the repositioning of

subwindows when a parent window is resized.  The attribute is
set on the children.  Normally, each child has a fixed position
measured from the origin of the parent window.  Window gravity
can be used to tell the server to unmap the child or to move the
child an amount depending on the change in size of the parent.
The constants used to set win_gravity are similar to
those for bit gravity, but their effect is quite different.NorthGravity specifies that the child window should be
moved horizontally by an amount one-half as great as the amount
the window was resized in the horizontal direction.  The child is
not moved vertically.  That means that if the window was originally
centered along the top edge of the window, it will also be centered

originally centered, its relative distance from the center may be
accentuated or reduced depending on whether the parent is resized
larger or smaller.ID="IX-1002-4-65"win_gravity attributewhen usefulWindow gravity is only useful for children placed against or very
near the outside edges of the parent or directly in its center.
Furthermore, the child must be centered along one of the outside
edges or in a corner.  Figure 4-2 shows the nine child
positions where window gravity can be useful and the setting
to be used for each position.ID="FG-1002-4-2"Child positions where window gravity is usefulFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.4.02.gif" ID="GC-1002-4-4"If any other setting is used for any of these positions, the
window gravity may move the child outside the resized parent,
since there are no checks to prevent this.  The application can
try to prevent it by getting the new position of the child from
a ConfigureNotify event (see LINKEND="S2-1002-3-16"Section 3.2.16, "Handling Resizing of the Window") and
moving the child inside if necessary.  But this will cause a flash
when the child window is automatically placed incorrectly and then
moved to the correct position by the application.  And if an
application has to go to the trouble to check the position and
move the child, it might as well just forget about window gravity
and place the child itself.NorthWestGravity (the default) indicates that the child (for
which this attribute is set) is not moved relative to its parent.UnmapGravity specifies that the subwindow should be unmapped
ID="IX-1002-4-66"UnmapGravity win_gravity
when the parent is resized.  This might be used when a client wishes
to recalculate the positions of its children.  Normally, the children
would appear in their old positions before the client could move them
into their recalculated positions.  This can be confusing to the user.
By setting the win_gravity attribute to UnmapGravity,
the server will unmap the windows.  They
can be repositioned at the client's leisure, and then the client
can remap them (with XMapSubwindows()) in their new locations.There is no routine to set the win_gravity attribute
individually; it can be set only with XChangeWindowAttributes()
or XCreateWindow().The win_gravity attribute has the following possible values:UnmapGravityID="IX-1002-4-67"UnmapNotify eventID="IX-1002-4-68"eventsUnmapNotify

a window while it is obscured or even while it is unmapped.
Backing is like having a copy of the window saved in a pixmap,
automatically copied to the screen whenever necessary to keep
the visible contents up to date.  Backing store is only available
on some servers, usually on high performance workstations.ID="IX-1002-4-71"DoesBackingStore macroID="IX-1002-4-72"macrosDoesBackingStore
These servers can be instructed when to back up a window and which
planes to save, through the backing store attributes.  Even when
it is available, the backing store should be avoided since it may
carry a heavy performance penalty on the server.  You can find out
whether backing is supported on a particular screen with the
DoesBackingStore() macro.
ID="IX-1002-4-73"DoesBackingStore macroID="IX-1002-4-74"macrosDoesBackingStoreA client might use this feature to back up a window the client is incapable
of redrawing for some reason or to be able to draw into a window
that is obscured or unmapped.Three separate attributes control backing:  backing_store,
backing_planes, and backing_pixel.  There are no
routines for setting these attributes individually (use
XChangeWindowAttributes() or XCreateWindow()).
ID="IX-1002-4-75"backing_planes attributeID="IX-1002-4-76"backing_pixel attributeID="IX-1002-4-77"attributesbacking_storeID="IX-1002-4-78"attributesbacking_planesID="IX-1002-4-79"attributesbacking_pixel
The backing_store attribute determines when and
if a window's contents are preserved by the server.  The
backing_planes attribute specifies which planes must
be preserved, and backing_pixel specifies the pixel
value used to fill planes not specified in backing_planes.
ID="IX-1002-4-80"backing_planes attributeID="IX-1002-4-81"attributesbacking_planes
The X server is free to save only the bit planes specified in
backing_planes and to regenerate the remaining planes
with the specified pixel value.When the backing store feature is active and the window is
larger than its parent, the server maintains complete contents,
not just the region within the parent's boundaries.  If the
server is maintaining the contents of a window, Expose
events will not be generated when that window is exposed.Use of the backing store does not make a window immune to
the other window attributes.  If the bit_gravity
is ForgetGravity, the contents will still be lost
whenever the window is resized.The backing_store attribute has the following possible values:NotUseful (default)ID="IX-1002-4-82"NotUsefulbacking_store attributeAdvises the server that maintaining contents is unnecessary.
A server may still choose to maintain contents.WhenMappedID="IX-1002-4-83"WhenMappedbacking_store attributeAdvises the server that it would be beneficial to maintain

(default all 1's) that indicates which planes of the
window hold dynamic data that must be preserved in the
backing store.The backing_pixel attribute specifies a pixel value
(default 0) to be used in planes not specified in the
backing_plane attribute.ID="S2-1002-4-6"Saving UnderID="IX-1002-4-85"save_under attributeID="IX-1002-4-86"attributessave_underThe save_under attribute controls whether the contents
of the screen beneath a window should be preserved just before
the window is mapped and replaced just after it is unmapped.
This attribute is most useful for pop-up windows, which need to
be on the screen only briefly.  No Expose events will
be sent to the windows that are exposed when the pop-up window
is unmapped, saving the time necessary to redraw their contents.Pop-up windows are usually children of the root window and,
therefore, are not constrained to appear within the application's
top-level window.  Therefore, without save_under both your application and other
applications on the screen would need to redraw areas
when the pop-up window is unmapped.Setting save_under is never necessary, but it can improve
the performance of the server running clients that frequently map
and unmap temporary windows.  The user would otherwise have to wait
for the area under the menu to be redrawn when the menu was unmapped.There is no routine for setting the save_under attribute
individually; it can only be set with XChangeWindowAttributes()
or XCreateWindow().The save_under attribute is different from the backing store;
save_under may save portions of several windows beneath a
window for the duration of the appearance of the window on the screen,
while the backing store saves the contents of a single window while
it is mapped or even when unmapped, depending on the attributes.ID="IX-1002-4-87"DoesSaveUnders macroID="IX-1002-4-88"macrosDoesSaveUnders
Not all servers are capable of saving under windows.  You can find
out whether this feature is supported on a particular screen with
the DoesSaveUnders() macro.The save_under attribute has the following possible values:False (default)Specifies that covered clients should be sent Expose
events when the window is unmapped, unless they are preserved
in the backing store.TrueSpecifies that the server should save areas under the window
and replace them when the window is unmapped.Setting the save_under attribute to True does
not prevent all Expose events on the area underneath.
For example, assume there is a window whose bit_gravity
is ForgetGravity, and this window lies under a window
that has the save_under attribute set to True.

manager to intercept any requests to map, move, resize, or
change the border width of windows.  This allows the window
manager to modify these requests, if necessary, to ensure
that they meet its window layout policy.Setting the override_redirect attribute True
for a window allows a window to be mapped, moved, resized, or
its border width changed without the intervention of the window
manager.  This override is usually done for menus that are
frequently mapped and almost immediately unmapped again.Under properly designed window managers, there is a property
you can set to tell the window manager to allow a window to
pop up with minimal intervention (XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR).

be used to interpret the pixel values in a window.For the large majority of clients without special color needs,
this attribute can be left in its default state.  By default,
the colormap attribute from the parent is taken, which,
if all ancestors of the window have used the default, will be
the default colormap.  This means that the default colormap for
the screen will be used to translate into colors the pixel
values drawn into this window.If the client requires its own colormap for some reason, the
client can create a colormap and set the colormap
attribute to the ID of the new colormap.  A colormap ID is
of type Colormap.
ID="IX-1002-4-105"colormap attributeID="IX-1002-4-106"attributescolormapID="IX-1002-4-107"colormapsand window managerThe window manager will read this attribute and install the
specified colormap into the hardware colormap when the user
indicates that the application should be active.  If the system
only has one hardware colormap, all other applications will appear
in false colors.  This is one good reason that applications are
encouraged not to create their own colormaps but to use the
default colormap instead.To understand this process, you need to know more about
colormaps in X, and for that, see LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color."ID="IX-1002-4-108"XSetWindowColormapXSetWindowColormap() sets the colormap attribute,

sometimes called the sprite.
In X, a cursor is a server resource which defines a cursor
pattern, its colors, and the point within the pattern that will
be reported in events (called the hotspot).  The ID of a
cursor is of type Cursor.Most clients will define a suitable cursor for their top-level
window and other cursors for each subwindow if needed.  For example,
xterm specifies the thin text cursor for the main window and
a vertical bidirectional arrow for the scrollbar.ID="IX-1002-4-112"cursorInputOnly windowsID="IX-1002-4-113"InputOnly windowand cursor
A cursor can be associated with any InputOutput or
InputOnly window using the cursor attribute.
Then the specified cursor will track the pointer while the
pointer is within the window's borders.A primary purpose for having a different cursor in a window is
to indicate visually to the user that something different will
happen to keyboard or button input while in the window.  Another
reason might be to change a cursor's color to increase its
visibility over the background of certain windows (although there
is another way to obtain contrast, with the cursor mask).  There
are probably other uses for a separate cursor.ID="IX-1002-4-114"cursordefinition ID="IX-1002-4-115"cursorattributeID="IX-1002-4-116"attributescursor

}  XWindowAttributes;XWindowAttributes structureexamplestructuresXWindowAttributesAs you can see, the members of XWindowAttributes that
cannot be directly written with XChangeWindowAttributes()
are separated into four groups.ID="IX-1002-4-137"geometrygetting for windowThe first group provides a way to get the window geometry.  This
information is returned by XGetGeometry(), but it might
be useful to use XGetWindowAttributes() instead if you need
both the geometry and a few attributes.ID="IX-1002-4-138"your_event_maskThe your_event_mask member can be useful if you want to
add event mask symbols to those already selected.  In a call to
XSelectInput(), you must always specify all the desired event
masks.  If you do not know which event masks are already selected
or do not want to bother passing an event_mask argument into
one of your routines, you could read the existing event mask here.
Then you could OR in any additional event mask symbols before
calling XSelectInput() or XChangeWindowAttributes().
See LINKEND="CH-1002-8-1"Chapter 8, "Events," for more information on the use of
event masks.The depth, class, visual, and screen
members are set when the window is created.  If the window was created
with XCreateSimpleWindow(), they were inherited from the parent.
If the window was created with XCreateWindow(), these members
were specified as arguments, except screen, which is indirectly
specified by the parent argument.  The screen member
points to a structure that tells you about the screen on which this
window was created.  This is one of the Screen structures
from the list in the Display structure, and therefore, the
information it contains can also be gotten from the macros as
described in LINKEND="S2-1002-3-3"Section 3.2.3, "Display Macros" and Appendix C, Macros, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.
Again, these should only be needed for convenience to avoid having to
pass around these values as arguments or global variables.The root member tells you the ID of the root window on
the screen on which your window was created.  It is usually more
convenient to use the RootWindow() macro.ID="IX-1002-4-139"colormapswhether installedID="IX-1002-4-140"map_installedXWindowAttributes component
The map_installed member can be monitored to tell your
application whether the colormap it has set in its colormap
attribute is currently installed.  If not, the application may be
displayed in false colors.  See LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color," for more details.ID="IX-1002-4-141"map_stateXWindowAttributes componentID="IX-1002-4-142"mapping statemonitoringID="IX-1002-4-143"visibilitymonitoring
The map_state member can be monitored by a program and used
to turn off processing while a window is unviewable.  Some applications
that continuously poll for input or draw (such as in action games) can stop doing so and save processor
cycles when there is no chance of getting input or no point in drawing.ID="IX-1002-4-144"all_event_masksXWindowAttributes memberThe all_event_masks member tells you all the event types
that are selected by all clients on the window requested.  This is
the OR of all the event_mask attributes for that window
for all clients.  By contrast, your_event_mask specifies
only the events selected by your client.Also note that XWindowAttributes is missing a few fields that
are present in XSetWindowAttributes.  This means that there
are some fields that can be set but not queried.  These fields are
the background and border pixel value and pixmap and the cursor.
The designers of X decided to make these fields nonreadable to
reduce restrictions on the implementation of backgrounds, borders,
and cursors in the server.ID="CH-1002-5-1" NUMBER="5"The Graphics ContextThe Graphics ContextThe graphics primitives supplied with X are quite simple.  Most of the
details about how graphics are to be drawn are stored in a resource
called a graphics context (GC).  GCs are stored in the server, thus
reducing the amount of information that needs to be transmitted for
each graphics request.  This chapter describes how to use GCs and provides
details on each member of the XGCValues structure.  Everyone should
read this chapter.ID="IX-1002-5-1"linesdrawingID="IX-1002-5-2"drawinglinesID="IX-1002-5-3"graphics contextID="IX-1002-5-4"contextgraphicsID="IX-1002-5-5"graphics contextgraphics contextID="IX-1002-5-6"graphics primitivesdefinitionID="IX-1002-5-7"graphicsdrawingID="IX-1002-5-8"drawinggraphicsID="IX-1002-5-9"primitivesgraphics primitivesThe X routines that draw graphics are called graphics primitives.
They draw dots, lines, text, images, and tile or fill areas, and
will be described fully in Chapter 6, Drawing Graphics and
Text.  But a given graphics primitive does not contain all the
information needed
to draw a particular graphic.  A server resource called a
graphics context (GC) contains values for variables that apply to
each graphics primitive.
The appearance of everything that is drawn by a program
is controlled by the GC that is specified with each graphics primitive.
(The border and background of a window are not affected or controlled
by the GC--they are controlled by window attributes, and are drawn
by the server.)
What is drawn into a pixmap is also controlled by the GC used
in the drawing to the pixmap and, again, possibly with a different
GC, if the pixmap is copied into a window.
To draw, you must first create a GC and set its values, then
specify that GC as an argument in the graphics primitive.ID="IX-1002-5-10"performancewith graphics contextThere are two performance-related reasons X was designed to use GCs.
First, they reduce the traffic between Xlib and the server because
the GC information
is held in the server and needs to be sent only once before the first
graphics request.  Each subsequent primitive that specifies the same
GC will use the same values.  When a few settings of the GC need to
be changed, only the selected few need to be sent, not the entire GC.
Second, you can create several GCs and then simply specify which GC you
want applied to each graphics request.  This has important performance
benefits on servers that are capable of caching multiple GCs in their
display hardware.The GC also allows for more convenient programming, since to provide
the same flexibility without the GC, you would need to specify an absurd
number of arguments every time you called a graphics primitive.ID="IX-1002-5-11"graphics primitivescompared to GCID="IX-1002-5-12"graphics contextcompared to graphics primitive
A few more words are needed regarding the distinction between the roles
of the graphics primitive and the GC.
You can think of a graphics primitive as specifying the general shape
to be drawn, while the GC specifies how to draw it.  For example,
a primitive that draws a filled rectangle specifies the top-left
corner of the rectangle in the drawable and its dimensions, while
the GC specifies its color or the pattern applied to it (among other
things).  Note that both the graphics primitive
and the GC play a role in selecting exactly which pixels are drawn.
For example, the graphics primitive specifies the start and end points
for lines (including unfilled arcs, rectangles, and polygons), while
the GC specifies the width of the line and the shape of the joints and
ends of the lines.
ID="IX-1002-5-13"pixel selection
Other components of the GC affect pixel selection with other
ID="IX-1002-5-14"clip mask
graphics primitives.  For all primitives, the GC includes a clip mask
that you can use to restrict which pixels are drawn.ID="IX-1002-5-15"destination drawableID="IX-1002-5-16"XCopyAreaID="IX-1002-5-17"XCopyPlane
To predict the effect of particular GC settings on a particular
graphics primitive, it is useful to visualize the drawing process in
a number of stages, even though in reality the drawing of each bit of
each pixel is performed by the server in a single equation.LINKEND="FN-1002-5-1"ID="FN-1002-5-1"I am indebted to Ollie Jones of PictureTel Corp. for the idea of
thinking of the graphics context as affecting several independent
stages in drawing, which he calls the "graphics pipeline."NUMERATION="ARABIC"ID="IX-1002-5-18"pixel selectionThe first stage is pixel selection.  As we just described, pixel
selection  is
specified by the graphics primitive, in some cases along with the
line_width, clip_mask, and other elements in the GC.
The result of the first stage is a bitmap--a single rectangle of bits,
with the pixels to be drawn set to one and the pixels not to be drawn
set to zero.The second stage applies one or two colors or a pattern to the
results of the first stage, resulting in a pixmap which has the same
depth (number of bits per pixel) as the drawable.  LINKEND="FN-1002-5-2"
The output of the second stage is referred to later in this chapter
ID="IX-1002-5-19"source for graphics
as the source.
ID="FN-1002-5-2"For XCopyArea() this second stage is skipped, since the
pixels taken from the source drawable must already have the same
depth as the destination drawable.In the third stage, a plane
mask may be applied to select which planes of the drawable can be
affected by the graphics request.  This is done to play tricks with
color, such as to draw temporary graphics that can be erased without
erasing other things already drawn in a window, as demonstrated in
Chapter 7, Color.  By default, the plane mask is all ones and
therefore has no effect on what is drawn.In the fourth stage, the pixel values resulting from stage three
can be combined with what is already on the screen
ID="IX-1002-5-20"logical functions
using so-called logical functions.  Most graphics are
drawn by simply overwriting the existing graphics using a logical
ID="IX-1002-5-21"logical functionsGXcopy
function of GXcopy, but there are useful
tricks that can be played by using certain other logical functions.
ID="IX-1002-5-22"rubber-banding
One such effect is called rubber-banding; the window manager uses this

technique to show you the outline of a window you are moving or
resizing.Figure 5-1 illustrates these four stages used in drawing a
wide line, and the GC elements that can be used to control each stage.
The sections below that describe the various members of the GC are
organized according to the stage that they affect.
This information is summarized in one of the GC-at-a-glance tables
inside the back cover of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.Since we are not yet using any of the tricks that require use of the
plane_mask or logical function, the third and fourth
stages in Figure 5-1 use the default values of these
GC elements.  They therefore do not modify the result of the
graphics primitive.To make this overview complete, it's important to mention that the GC
also has the following two features (described more completely in
LINKEND="S1-1002-5-6"Section 5.6, "Graphics Exposure" and LINKEND="S1-1002-5-7"Section 5.7, "Subwindow Mode"):MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-5-27"graphics_exposureGC componentID="IX-1002-5-28"graphics contextgraphics_exposure member

to indicate whether areas being copied using XCopyArea() and
ID="IX-1002-5-35"XCopyAreaXCopyPlane() requests are visible or invisible.  (This is important
because invisible areas cannot be copied, and must be drawn some
other way.)
ID="IX-1002-5-36"XCopyPlaneThe subwindow_mode member lets
you specify whether subwindows obscure graphics
drawn on the parent.  The default is True, and
usually needs changing only for rubber-banding.Now we will discuss how to create and set the GC, before moving
on to details of individual members of the GC.ID="FG-1002-5-1"Four stages in drawing a lineFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.5.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-5-1"ID="IX-1002-5-37"linesdrawingID="IX-1002-5-38"drawinglinesID="S1-1002-5-1"Creating and Setting a Graphics ContextBefore a GC can be used, you must create it by calling XCreateGC().
ID="IX-1002-5-39"XCreateGCID="IX-1002-5-40" SPAN="START"graphics contextcreating and settingXCreateGC() requires only four arguments:  display,
drawable, values,  and valuemask.MARK="BULLET"The display argument (pointer to a Display structure)
should be familiar by now; it specifies the connection to the X server.
The display argument is used in virtually every Xlib routine.The drawable argument is a window or pixmap ID.  You might
ID="IX-1002-5-41"drawableargument to XCreateGCID="IX-1002-5-42"display argument
think that the drawable argument specifies which window or
pixmap the GC is to be used in, but this is not necessarily the case.
It really indicates which screen the GC resource is associated with
and the depth of windows it can be used with.  A GC can be used on
any window or pixmap of the same depth and on the same screen as the
drawable specified.  (Drawables were introduced in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-12"Section 2.3.3, "Pixmaps and Drawables.")
This implies that if you want to draw into a pixmap of depth one, you
need to create that pixmap first, and then use it as the
ID="IX-1002-5-43"depthand GCID="IX-1002-5-44"graphics contextand depthdrawable argument in creating the GC.
A BadMatch error when drawing usually indicates you did not
use the right drawable when creating the GC.
ID="IX-1002-5-45"drawableThe values argument is an XGCValues structure (shown
ID="IX-1002-5-46"values argumentID="IX-1002-5-47"XGCValuesID="IX-1002-5-48"structuresXGCValues
in Example 5-1) filled with the desired settings for the GC.
ID="IX-1002-5-49"valuemask argumentThe valuemask argument specifies which members of the
XGCValues structure are actually read.  The members not
represented by a bit set to one in the valuemask are given
the default values listed in LINKEND="S1-1002-5-10"Section 5.10, "Querying the Graphics Context." The symbols used to
make this bitmask correspond to the members of XGCValues
shown in Table 5-1.The GC is set very much like the window attributes are set, described
in LINKEND="S1-1002-4-2"Section 4.2, "The Window Attribute Structures."  Of course, there is a different structure
and there are different masks for specifying which members are to
be set.  One other difference in practice is that every member of
the GC can be set with an individual "convenience routine."
You may prefer, therefore, to create a default GC and then modify it with
the individual routines rather than to set all the members in both
the structure and the mask before you call XCreateGC() or
XChangeGC().  Both approaches are demonstrated below.Example 5-1 and Table 5-1 present the

GC.  A useful quick reference to the graphics context is provided
inside the back cover of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.A valuemask composed of the symbols shown in Table
5-1
is used in XChangeGC(), XCopyGC(), and XCreateGC().
ID="IX-1002-5-54"XChangeGCID="IX-1002-5-55"XCopyGCID="IX-1002-5-56"XCreateGC
In XCopyGC(), though, the valuemask indicates which
members are copied from the source GC to the destination GC, and
the rest of the members in the destination are left unchanged.  In
XChangeGC(), the specified members are changed and the rest
ID="IX-1002-5-57"XChangeGC
are left unchanged.Example 5-2 shows a simple way to set some of the values
for a GC before creating it.  This example uses the default values
except for the foreground and background pixel values.
You must always set at least the foreground component of the GC, and
also the background component if it is used in what you intend to draw.
This is because the default values for the foreground and background
components, zero and one respectively, are not guaranteed to be black
and white or even contrasting.  (The relationship between pixel values
and colors is explained in Chapter 7, Color.)

/* Now you can use gc in drawing routines */In Example 5-2, the foreground pixel value is set to the
value returned by the BlackPixel() macro.  This will result
in a color of black if the default colormap is installed (more on
this in LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color").  To obtain a pixel value that
represents any color other than black or white, you will need
to allocate the color as described in LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color."Convenience functions are also available to change most elements
of a GC after it is created.  These functions are listed
in Sections 5.3 through 5.7, which describe each GC
element in detail.  Example 5-3 performs the same functions
as Example 5-2 but by creating a default GC and then modifying
the contents with convenience functions.

/* Now you can use gc in drawing routines */You may wonder which of these two ways is more efficient, setting
the XGCValues and valuemask, or calling the convenience
functions.  Actually, there is not much difference, since in both
cases, the individual requests to change the same GC are packaged
into a single protocol request before being sent to the server.
This optimization is implemented by Xlib.
The method you should choose is mainly a matter of personal preference.Also note that Xlib provides the function XFlushGC() to
defeat Xlib's caching of GC changes by sending them to the server
immediately instead of waiting until the GC is needed.  XFlushGC()ID="IX-1002-5-60"XFlushGC
is used mainly in extensions that have drawing requests
which otherwise would not trigger Xlib's cache.ID="S1-1002-5-2"Switching Between Graphics ContextsID="IX-1002-5-61" SPAN="START"graphics contextswitchingID="IX-1002-5-62" SPAN="START"graphics contextswitching betweenOne purpose of the GC is to store information about how to interpret
graphics requests so that the same information does not have to be
sent with every request.  Another useful feature of the GC concept
is that you can create several GCs with the different characteristics
you need and then switch between them.  Example 5-4 demonstrates
how this is done.  It creates two slightly different GCs with swapped
foreground and background pixel values.

of a single GC depends on the particular server implementation.  On
some types of display hardware, several or many GCs can be cached.
On these servers, it is faster to switch between GCs than to change
members of them.  On servers that do not cache or that cache only
one GC, it is faster to change one or two elements of the GC than
to switch between two slightly different GCs.  There is no way for
the application to tell which of these two server types is in use.
Therefore, accepted practice is to compromise by creating a small
number of GCs (more on this in LINKEND="S1-1002-5-9"Section 5.9, "GCs and Server Efficiency").Now that you know how to create, set, and modify the GC, and how to
set up multiple GCs, we can go into more detail about each element
of the GC.  The following sections describe each member of the graphics

pixels.  The line width can be set with XSetLineAttributes().A line_width greater than or equal to 1 is considered a
wide line, and the value 0 is a special case, considered
a thin line.  Wide and thin lines often use different drawing
algorithms.  The thin line is intended to be a fast algorithm for
drawing a line of width 1 but may not be as uniform as a wide line between
different servers.Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by the graphics
request.  A wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to
[x2,y2] always draws the same pixels as a wide line
drawn from [x2,y2] to [x1,y1], not
counting cap and join styles.  This is not necessarily the case for
thin lines.Unless otherwise specified by the join or cap style, the bounding
box of a wide line with endpoints [x1,y1],

A pixel is drawn if the center of the pixel is fully inside the
bounding box (which is viewed as having infinitely thin edges).
If the center of the pixel is exactly on the bounding box, it is
part of the line only if the interior of the box is immediately
to the pixel's right.  Pixels with centers on a horizontal edge
are part of the line only if the interior of the box is immediately
below the pixel.Thin lines (line_width == 0) are one-pixel-wide lines drawn
using an unspecified, device-dependent fast algorithm.  The set of
points comprising thin lines will not be affected by clipping.A wide line of width 1 and a thin line with line_width 0
drawn between the same two points may not be exactly alike.  Because
of their different drawing algorithms, thin lines may not mix well
with wide lines, aesthetically speaking.  For precise and uniform
results across all displays, use a line_width of 1 rather
than 0.  If speed is the goal, use a line_width of 0.

text-drawing graphics primitives that use this GC, and can be set with
XSetFont().
If the specified font has not been loaded by this client, a graphics
primitive that tries to draw text will not fail; it just will not draw.
Therefore, you should make sure you load the font.ID="IX-1002-5-145"loadingfontsID="IX-1002-5-146"fontsloading
The X server actually loads a requested font into memory only when
XLoadFont() or XLoadQueryFont() is called and if the
ID="IX-1002-5-147"XLoadFontID="IX-1002-5-148"XLoadQueryFont
specified font has not already been loaded by another client.  A
font is unloaded when the last program using the font exits or
unloads it.  Duplicate copies of a font are never stored in the server.There are several ways to deal with fonts.  Most programs will use
XLoadQueryFont() to load a font and get information about the
dimensions of each character.  XLoadQueryFont() returns a
pointer to an XFontStruct.  The font in the GC can then be
ID="IX-1002-5-149"XFontStruct structure
set to XFontStruct.fid.  (See LINKEND="CH-1002-6-1"Chapter 6, "Drawing Graphics and Text," for details.)The default font is always loaded, but it is not the same on all

the default font on the particular server it is connected to.ID="S2-1002-5-3"Fill RuleID="IX-1002-5-150"XSetFillStyleID="IX-1002-5-151"graphics contextfill_rule memberID="IX-1002-5-152"fill_ruleGC componentID="IX-1002-5-153"XPolygonRegionThe fill_rule member of XGCValues defines which

areas overlap an odd number of times, they are not drawn.  Technically,
it specifies that a point is drawn if an infinite ray with the point
as origin crosses the path an odd number of times.WindingRule, also shown in Figure 5-7, means that
overlapping areas are always filled, regardless of how many times they
overlap.  Technically, this rule specifies that a point is inside the
filled area if an infinite ray with the point as origin crosses an
unequal number of clockwise- and counterclockwise-directed path segments.Since polygons are drawn as a series of points connected by
lines, the order of the points determines the direction of
each line.  A clockwise-directed path segment is one which
crosses the ray from left to right as observed from the point.
A counterclockwise-directed segment is one which crosses the
ray from right to left as observed from the point.  The case
where a directed line segment is coincident with the ray is
uninteresting, because you can simply choose a different ray
that is not coincident with a segment.All calculations are performed on infinitely small points, so
that if any point within a pixel is considered inside, the
entire pixel is drawn. Pixels with centers exactly on vertical boundaries
are considered inside only if the filled area is to
the right.  On horizontal boundaries, the pixel is considered
inside only if the filled area is below the pixel.ID="FG-1002-5-7"fill_rule constants for filling closed polygonsFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.5.07.gif" ID="GC-1002-5-8"ID="S2-1002-5-4"Arc Mode (for Filling)ID="IX-1002-5-157"graphics contextarc_mode memberID="IX-1002-5-158"arc_modeGC componentID="IX-1002-5-159"graphics contextarc_mode memberID="IX-1002-5-160"circle drawingThe arc_mode member of XGCValues controls filling

indicates which pixels of the destination drawable are to be affected

By default, all pixels in the destination drawable are affected.Pixels not represented by a set bit in the clip mask will not be

ID="IX-1002-5-168"XSetClipRectanglesID="IX-1002-5-169"XSetRegionXSetClipMask() sets a clip mask composed of an arbitrary set
of bits.
XSetClipRectangles()
specifies an array of rectangles that will collectively be used as
a clip mask.
XSetRegion() is another way to set the clip
mask to a set of rectangles, sometimes more convenient than
XSetClipRectangles().  XUnionRectWithRegion() can be
ID="IX-1002-5-170"XUnionRectWithRegion
used to add the rectangle from an Expose event into a region.
Then XSetRegion() sets the GC to clip output to those areas.
This is useful for redrawing only the areas that have been exposed.

ID="IX-1002-5-175" SPAN="END"pixel selectionID="S1-1002-5-4"Controlling Coloring and PatterningThe first stage of the drawing process (pixel selection) results in a
bitmap with bits set to one indicating the pixels to be drawn.
However, a window on a color display (or a pixmap to be copied to a
color display) must have multiple bits per pixel to represent colors.
The second stage of the drawing process colors the pixels.There are four ways of coloring the pixels, controlled by
the fill_style member of the GC.  One of them uses
a single color, and the other three apply patterns in different ways.
You can pattern anything you can draw, including text, although lines
of width 0 are not patterned.We will begin by discussing the simple case, drawing with only the
foreground color using fill_style of FillSolid.
Then, to understand the effect of the patterning values for the
fill_style, we must digress into a short description of

The uses of the background color are restricted and are described in
LINKEND="S2-1002-5-10"Section 5.4.5, "Drawing in Foreground and Background."ID="FN-1002-5-3"For practical purposes, you can loosely think of a pixel value
as the "color" in which an object will be drawn, though it applies
to both color and monochrome systems.  Even on a color system, the
actual color resulting from the specified foreground or background
pixel value will depend on the plane mask and logical function, as
well as the red, green, and blue values stored in the
colormap entry to which the resulting value points!  Later references
in this chapter to drawing in the "foreground color" should be
interpreted in this light.
You can set the foreground with XSetForeground().

specified with ts_x_origin and ts_y_origin, which
are relative to the origin of the destination drawable.Creating a pixmap of depth one to be used as a stipple is described
in LINKEND="S2-1002-6-5"Section 6.1.5, "Creating Bitmaps, Pixmaps, Tiles, and Stipples." The stipple pixmap must be created on the same

a BadMatch error is generated.  If a pixmap is used

excluded from the computation.  The clip_mask restricts
the operation to a subset of the pixels, likewise eliminating
some pixels from the result.The source, destination, and plane_mask

of the source region will be obscured, unmapped, or otherwise
unavailable.  If this is the case, it may be desirable to generate
an event to signal the client that one or more areas in the
destination window could not be copied to and should be redrawn
some other way.The graphics_exposures flag in the GC specifies whether or
not events should be generated in such a case.  There are actually
two event types that can be generated if graphics_exposures
is set to True:MARK="BULLET"One or more GraphicsExpose events are sent when a destination
region cannot be completely drawn because the source region was
obscured, unmapped, or otherwise unavailable.A single NoExpose event occurs when the specified source

"rubber banding" of window outlines while they are being moved or

shareable, separate clients should not attempt to share GCs,
because of the way GCs are implemented.ID="S1-1002-5-9"GCs and Server EfficiencySome servers can cache a limited number of GCs in their display
hardware.  These systems achieve highest performance when the
number of GCs created by an application is less than the number
that can be cached at one time.  Furthermore, each GC takes up
some amount of server memory.  Therefore, it is a general principle
that an application should create as few GCs as reasonably possible.However, this should not be taken to extremes.  For example, all
applications could be written to use only one GC, changing it
frequently every time different characteristics are needed.  But
this defeats two of the purposes of the GC, which are to reduce
network traffic and simplify programming.  There are also
performance costs when GCs are changed too often.Deciding how many GCs to create and when to change them is a
trade-off between the benefits of a more efficient server against
the benefits of reduced network traffic and simpler programming.
The designers of X still think that using a small number of GCs
is, overall, the best approach.ID="S1-1002-5-10"Querying the Graphics ContextWhen you call a number of the GC convenience routines, such as
XSetForeground() and XSetLineAttributes(), you might
expect each to generate a separate protocol request to change the
GC.  But this is not what happens.  Xlib saves up the changes in
an internal structure and makes a single request to the server
just before the GC is actually used by a drawing request.The type GC is a pointer to this internal structure.  All
Xlib routines
use a pointer to this internal structure, not a integer ID, as we have
previously implied.  However, this fact does not impact how you write
Xlib code at all.  In practice, a pointer to an opaque structure and
an integer ID such as a window ID are treated exactly the same.ID="IX-1002-5-271"XGetGCValuesIn R4, the XGetGCValues() function has been added to allow
clients to read Xlib's cache of the fields in each GC.  This can
save an application from having to maintain its own cache of GC
values, when it needs to change the GC in several different places
in ways that depend on the current contents.Note that XGetGCValues() is not a true round-trip
query to the server--there is no protocol request that actually
asks the server for these values.  This has good and bad consequences.
The good part is that XGetGCValues() is fast because it is not
subject to network delays.  The bad side is that the values in Xlib's
cache do not include the default values for certain of the GC members.
The tile, stipple, and font fields contain
invalid IDs when XGetGCValues() is called on a default GC.
Therefore, even though there is actually a default font that is always
loaded on a server, you cannot use XGetGCValues() to find out its
ID.  To get information about the default font,
pass the default GC to XQueryFont() and it will get information
about the default font.  Neither is there any obvious reason for
needing the IDs of the tile and stipple in the default GC.Also note that the clip_mask and dashes members of
the GC cannot be queried.ID="S1-1002-5-11"The Default GC Versus Default Values of a GCID="IX-1002-5-272"graphics contextdefaultID="IX-1002-5-273" SPAN="START"graphics contextdefault valuesID="IX-1002-5-274" SPAN="START"foregroundID="IX-1002-5-275" SPAN="START"backgroundThe server creates one GC, called the default GC, when
it starts up.  This GC is returned by the XDefaultGC() and the
DefaultGC()
macro.  It contains foreground and background
colors that are guaranteed contrasting (but not necessarily
black and white), and it contains a default font that is
guaranteed to be loaded, but is not necessarily the same font on
all servers.  The values in the default GC must not be changed.The default GC can be used in simple applications.  But it is not
very useful since all applications should provide user customization
of fonts and colors, and few can avoid the need to modify other GC
components as well.When you create a GC of your own, its default values are slightly
different from the values of the default GC.  Its foreground and
background values are 0 and 1, respectively, so they are not
necessarily black and white or contrasting.  That's why you must
always set foreground
and background when you create a GC.
Also, the default font is implementation dependent, and it may
not be loaded.  Therefore, you must always load the font
before attempting to draw with it.Table 5-3 shows the default values for all members of a

of the draw_box routine, which is called in the simple window
manager winman described in LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management."Note that, before you draw anything, you must set up a graphics
context to specify, at minimum, the foreground and background
pixel values for drawing and the font if you are drawing text.
For monochrome applications, you should set these values using
the BlackPixel() and WhitePixel() macros described
in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."  For color applications, you should use one
of the color allocation routines described in LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color."
While the default foreground and background values in a GC may
work on some servers, they are hardcoded (0 and 1) and should not
be relied upon by any client, since they will give inconsistent results
on color displays.ID="S1-1002-6-1"DrawingID="IX-1002-6-1" SPAN="START"drawingroutinesID="IX-1002-6-2" SPAN="START"primitivesThe X drawing primitives are easy-to-use routines capable of drawing
points, connected lines (polylines), disconnected lines (disjoint
polylines), rectangles, and circles, ellipses, or arcs.
Separate primitives are provided that fill rectangles, polygons,
circles, ellipses, and arcs.These primitives select the source pixels that will be operated on
according to the graphics context. The GC is described in Chapter
5, The Graphics Context.  The most common error generated while drawing is
BadMatch.  If you get this error, it means the drawable and
ID="IX-1002-6-3"BadMatch errorin drawingID="IX-1002-6-4"drawingBadMatch error
the GC specified in the drawing call are not the same depth.  The
safest way to prevent this is to always create the drawable first,
and then use the drawable as an argument when creating the GC that
will be used to draw into it.ID="IX-1002-6-5"XDrawPointXDrawPoint() requires only the coordinates of the point to be
drawn.  XDrawPoints() requires a pointer to an array of coordinates
for the points, the number of points, and a mode flag which controls
whether the coordinates are interpreted relative to the origin of the
ID="IX-1002-6-6"drawable
drawable or relative to the previous point drawn.ID="IX-1002-6-7"XDrawLinesXDrawLine() is similar to XDrawPoint() but requires two
points, a beginning and an end.  XDrawLines() works just like
XDrawPoints() but draws lines between consecutive points in the
list.  If the first and last points coincide, the lines will be joined
properly according to the join_style in the GC.ID="IX-1002-6-8"XDrawSegmentsXDrawSegments() draws lines that are not necessarily connected
end to end.  It requires an array of pairs of endpoints.  There is
no mode flag for XDrawSegments(), so the coordinates are always
relative to the origin of the drawable.  If the end point of one segment
and the beginning of the next coincide, the lines will be joined according
to the join_style in the GC.  The remaining end points will be
drawn according to the cap_style in the GC.ID="IX-1002-6-9"XDrawRectangleXDrawRectangle() draws the outline of a rectangle when given
the upper-left corner and the height and width.  XDrawRectangles()
draws multiple rectangles from an array of corner coordinates and
dimensions.  The actual width and height of a rectangle is one pixel
larger than the dimensions specified, according to the X protocol,
as shown in Figure 6-2.  These actual dimensions maintain
consistency with the definition of a filled rectangle or a clipping
region, which are exactly the size specified.  The corners of rectangles
are drawn according to the join_style in the GC.ID="IX-1002-6-10"XDrawArcXDrawArc() is similar to XDrawRectangle(), except that
it draws an arc that fits inside the rectangle.  This function can
draw circles and ellipses (or parts thereof) whose axes are parallel
ID="IX-1002-6-11"circle drawingID="IX-1002-6-12"ellipse drawing
to the window coordinates.  An elliptical arc occurs if the rectangle
is not a square.  The extent of the arc is specified by two
angles:  the first is the starting angle relative to the three-o'clock
position, and the second is the angle relative to the starting position.
The angles are signed integers in sixty-fourths of a degree (0 to 360 * 64
ID="IX-1002-6-13"angle measurement for arcs
is a complete circle), with positive values drawing the arc counterclockwise.
This scale factor is required so that angles can be specified more accurately
than allowed by integral values between 0 and 360 degrees.  Figure 6-1
demonstrates the arguments needed for XDrawArc().ID="FG-1002-6-1"Angle measurement for XDrawArc or XDrawArcs()FORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.6.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-6-1"X Version 11 also supports the XDraw() and XDrawFilled()ID="IX-1002-6-14"XDrawID="IX-1002-6-15"XDrawFilled
routines that were available in X Version 10, though the performance of
these is low.  These routines are described in Appendix B, X10 Compatibility.Xlib does not provide routines for drawing Bezier or cubic spline
curves.ID="S2-1002-6-1"The Request Size LimitOne caveat of all the Xlib routines that draw multiple objects is
that there is a maximum number of objects that can be drawn with
a single call, and this number varies according to the server your
application is connected to.  In Release 4, this affects the calls
XDrawArcs(), XDrawLines(), XDrawPoints(),
XDrawRectangles(), XDrawSegments(), XDrawText(),
XDrawText16(), XFillArcs(), and XFillRectangles().
In Release 5 and later, it affects only XDrawArcs(),
XDrawLines(), XDrawText(), and XDrawText16(),
because the other calls are divided into multiple requests.
(This cannot be done for XDrawArcs() or XDrawLines()
because this would disturb the server's joining of the lines.)To determine how many objects you can draw in a single call, you
find out your server's maximum request size using XMaxRequestSize().
Subtract 3, and this is the maximum number of points you can draw in a
single XDrawPoints() request.  You can draw one-half this many
lines, segments, or rectangles, and one-third this many arcs.For XDrawText(), XDrawText16(), XwcDrawText(), and
XmbDrawText(), which draw a series
of strings as will be described later, the maximum number is based
on the number and length of these strings.ID="S2-1002-6-2"Scaling GraphicsID="IX-1002-6-16"scaling graphicsID="IX-1002-6-17"graphicsscalingAll drawing measurements in X are made in pixels.  The positions you
specify are relative to the origin (upper-left corner inside border)
of the window specified in the drawing request.  The width and height
of a rectangle or bounding box for an arc are also specified in pixels.Scaling based on pixels has a weakness caused by the fact that pixels
are not always the same size on the screen.  Imagine a desktop publishing
application.  Its goal is to make everything drawn on the screen as
close as possible to what will appear on the printed page.  People may
run the application from a PC which has a 9.5" by 7.25" screen with
an 640 by 480 array of pixels or from a workstation which has a
13.5" by 10.5" screen with an array of, perhaps, 1152 by 900 pixels.
The ruler lines drawn by the application would look much different
on the two screens if their sizes were not adjusted accordingly.  The
application should calculate the ratio of the size in millimeters of the
screen to its size in pixels, in both directions.  The required information
is returned by the DisplayHeight(), DisplayHeightMM(),
DisplayWidth(), and DisplayWidthMM() macros.
ID="IX-1002-6-18"aspect ratioID="IX-1002-6-19"pixel aspect ratioand graphicsID="IX-1002-6-20"size distortionID="IX-1002-6-21"distortion of graphics
This correction of size distortion also solves a second, smaller
problem.  The relative density of pixels in the x and y
directions on the screen may vary.  For example, a square drawn
with equal width and height may appear rectangular on the screen,
since some (but, fortunately, not many) screens have more space between
rows of pixels than between columns.  By correcting for size variation,
this problem goes away.  It is also possible to allow size variations
but correct for the aspect ratio distortion by multiplying the height
measurements in pixels by the ratio:
     DisplayHeight/DisplayHeightMM()
     _______________________________
      DisplayWidth/DisplayWidthMM()
ID="IX-1002-6-22" SPAN="END"primitivesor by multiplying the width measurements in pixels by the inverse of
this ratio.  Do not multiply both the width and height measurements.ID="S2-1002-6-3"Example of Drawing GraphicsID="IX-1002-6-23"draw_graphics exampleAll drawing routines are used in essentially the same way:MARK="BULLET"First, create and set the graphics context.Then calculate the dimensions and placement of what
you want to draw.Finally, do the actual drawing.Example 6-1 shows a routine named draw_graphics
that places and draws a rectangle.  As you can tell from the brevity
of the routine, most of the trouble goes into setting the GC properly
and positioning the item to be drawn.  The actual drawing is very simple.This routine is called from the basicwin program described
in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."  By the time it is called, we have already
done many things.  The display is opened, windows and resources created
(including the GC), and window manager hints set.  Most importantly,
draw_graphics is called only in response to Expose
events.  It is used to draw the window for the first time and to
redraw the contents of areas exposed later.

act much like the drawing routines described at the start
of LINKEND="S1-1002-6-1"Section 6.1, "Drawing" except that they fill an area
instead of drawing the outline.Surprisingly, the filling and drawing versions of the rectangle
routines do not draw the same outline if given the same arguments.
The routine that fills a rectangle draws an outline one pixel shorter
in width and height than the routine that just draws the outline, as
shown in Figure 6-2.  It is easy to adjust the arguments for
the rectangle calls so that one draws the outline and another fills
a completely different set of interior pixels.  Simply add 1 to
x and y and subtract 1 from width and
height.ID="IX-1002-6-33"XFillPolygonThe XFillPolygon() routine is somewhat different from
the other filling routines, since there is no directly
analogous routine that draws a polygon with lines (though
XDrawLines() can be used to draw a polygon).  Like the
other routines, XFillPolygon() uses an array of points
to specify the nodes to be connected, but it connects the first
and last points to form a closed figure and then fills the
resulting shape.  The shape flag (which can be one of
ID="IX-1002-6-34"shape flagof XFillPolygon
the symbols Complex, Convex, or Nonconvex)
ID="IX-1002-6-35"Complex shape flagfor XFillPolygonID="IX-1002-6-36"Convex shape flag for XFillPolygonID="IX-1002-6-37"Nonconvexshape flag for XFillPolygon
is a hint that may enable the server to improve the performance of
the filling operation.  The mode argument indicates whether
the coordinates of the vertices are interpreted relative to the
origin of the drawable or relative to the previous point.
ID="IX-1002-6-38"drawableThe fill_rule member of the GC controls how complex,
self-intersecting polygons are filled.  The WindingRule
setting of the fill_rule specifies that overlapping
areas
of a polygon drawn in a single call are filled.  With
EvenOddRule, areas overlapping an odd number of times
are not filled.

of type Pixmap.  Applications often need to create
pixmaps for icon patterns, cursors, and tiles.The data used to create a pixmap for any purpose can be
included in a program at compile time or read in at run time.
In both methods, you must have a bitmap file created with
ID="IX-1002-6-45"bitmap file formatID="IX-1002-6-46"filesformat (bitmap)XWriteBitmapFile() or the bitmap application.In the first method, you use an #include statement to read
the bitmap file at run time and then call XCreateBitmapFromData()
or XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData() if you want a pixmap with
depth for a window background or a tile.In the second method, you create a single-plane PixmapID="IX-1002-6-47"XWriteBitmapFile
with XCreatePixmap() and call XReadBitmapFile()ID="IX-1002-6-48"XReadBitmapFileID="IX-1002-6-49"XCreatePixmap
to fill the Pixmap with the data from the file. Then
if you want a pixmap with depth for the background of a window
ID="IX-1002-6-50"depth
or for a tile, you can create another pixmap of the desired
depth and call XCopyPlane() to copy the bitmap into the
pixmap.  Normally, an application would choose reading the data
from a file if the user needs to be able to change the bitmap
between invocations of the client.XWriteBitmapFile() can be used to write the contents of a
bitmap into a file conforming to X Version 11 bitmap file format.

}To create a pixmap with depth from included data, you can substitute
XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData() for XCreateBitmapFromData()
in the example above.  However, to create a pixmap with depth from data
read from a file, you must create a bitmap with XReadBitmapFile()
as shown above, then create a pixmap with depth using
XCreatePixmap(),
then copy from the bitmap to the pixmap using XCopyPlane().ID="S2-1002-6-6"Copying and Clearing AreasID="IX-1002-6-52"copying areasXClearWindow() clears an entire window.  If the window
ID="IX-1002-6-53"XClearWindowID="IX-1002-6-54"windowsclearingID="IX-1002-6-55"clearing windows
has a background_ pixmap attribute, then the window is
redrawn with this tile.  If the window has background_pixmap
or background_pixel attribute None, then the contents
of the window are not changed.  No exposure events are generated by
XClearWindow(), since the usual intent of this command is to
ID="IX-1002-6-56"XClearWindow
clear the window, not to refresh the old contents (which would be the
normal response to an exposure event).  Conversely, XClearWindow()
is not needed to clear a window before redrawing it due to an
Expose event, because the server automatically draws the
exposed area with the background pixel value or pixmap.XClearArea() is like XClearWindow() but acts on a
ID="IX-1002-6-57"XClearArea
particular area within a window defined by the call's x,
y, height, and width arguments.  If the
height or width argument is 0, then some special
rules take effect that clear an area to the right and/or
the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 6-3.ID="FG-1002-6-3"XClearArea() -- area cleared with various width and height argumentsFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.6.03.gif" ID="GC-1002-6-4"If the width argument is 0, the left edge of the cleared
area is x and the right edge is the right border of the
window.  If the height is 0, the top is y and the
bottom is the bottom of the window.  If both height and
width are 0, then the area between x and y
and the bottom and right sides of the window are cleared.  The
exposures argument indicates whether an Expose
event is generated on the cleared area.
ID="IX-1002-6-58"windowscopyingXCopyArea() is used for many purposes, including copying
ID="IX-1002-6-59"XCopyArea
off-screen pixmaps to the screen and copying one screen area to
another.  You need to specify the source and destination drawables,
ID="IX-1002-6-60"destination drawable
the upper-left corner of the source and destination locations,
and the width and height of the area.  Note that the source and
destination drawables must have the same depth, or an error occurs.Areas of the source that are not visible, not preserved in the
backing store, or outside the boundaries of the source drawable
are not copied.  If the destination has a background tile attribute
other than None, the destination areas corresponding to the
uncopyable areas of the source are filled or tiled according to the
background attributes.The operation of XCopyPlane() is quite different from
XCopyArea().  A single plane of the source region is
ID="IX-1002-6-61"XCopyAreaversusXCopyPlaneID="IX-1002-6-62"XCopyPlaneversus XCopyAreaID="IX-1002-6-63"depth
given "depth" by "coloring" it with the foreground and
background pixel values from the GC, before being written
into the destination drawable.  In other words, set bits in the
source plane are given the foreground pixel value in the destination
drawable, while unset bits are given the background pixel value.
Therefore, XCopyPlane() is useful for translating a pixmap of
depth 1 (a bitmap) into a pixmap of the same depth as a window where
it can be displayed.  If the graphics_exposures member of the
GC is True, then one or more GraphicsExpose events are

generated on the destination region when part of the source region
could not be copied or a single NoExpose event is generated
if all the source region could be copied.  This is the case for both
XCopyArea() and XCopyPlane() requests.That's about all there is to say about simple drawing, filling,
copying, and clearing.  Now we'll move on to drawing text.ID="S1-1002-6-2"Fonts and TextID="IX-1002-6-68" SPAN="START"fontsID="IX-1002-6-69"fontsdescriptionA font in X is a set of bitmaps and may represent text, a set

Large numbers of characters are necessary for Oriental languages.On many servers, only single-byte fonts can be used with the routines
whose names do not end in 16 and only two-byte fonts may be used with
the routines that do end in 16.  However, some servers may handle
either type in either routine.  At the moment, there is only one

the list of fonts.  The XLoadFont() command loads a font and

needs to calculate the extent of many strings in the same font, then
you may want to get the table of the extents of the font characters
and perform this calculation locally in order to save repeated
round-trip requests to the server.  This information is stored in an
XFontStruct (described in LINKEND="S3-1002-6-2"Section 6.2.4.2, "The XFontStruct Structure"), which is

using resources.  However, you do need to specify default fonts.
Font naming is defined by the X Logical Font Description convention,
known as XLFD.  The complete XLFD is presented in Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.  However,
the basics are covered in Appendix A, Specifying Fonts.ID="S2-1002-6-10"Character MetricsID="IX-1002-6-102"charactersmetricsID="IX-1002-6-103"metricsdefinitionID="IX-1002-6-104"font metricsBefore going on to the structures that specify characters and
fonts, we should go over some terminology.  The measurements
shown in Figure 6-4 are some of the font metrics
that are the measurements in pixels that describe both a font
as a whole and each character in the font.  The names shown for
the metrics are members of the font information structures.Notice that the origin is not at the upper-left corner of each
character, as in most of the rest of X.  The origin of each
character is on the baseline, which is a row of pixels
somewhere near the lower middle of a line of text.  This part
of X has been written to conform closely to the existing standards
for fonts provided by companies like Adobe.ID="IX-1002-6-105"XCharStruct structureID="IX-1002-6-106"XFontStruct structure
Notice that two structures are mentioned in Figure 6-4,
XFontStruct and XCharStruct.  XFontStruct
holds information about the entire font, while XCharStruct
(itself the type of several members of XFontStruct) holds
information about a single character.  These two structures have
some common member names, but their meanings are different.ID="IX-1002-6-107"ascent of characterID="IX-1002-6-108"descent of characterdefinitionID="IX-1002-6-109"fontsascent definitionID="IX-1002-6-110"fontsdescent definition
There is a difference between the font ascent and
descent members in XFontStruct and the
ascent and descent members in each individual
XCharStruct.  The former specifies the largest of each
measurement in any character in the font, and the latter specifies
the measurements of single characters.ID="S3-1002-6-1"The XCharStruct StructureID="IX-1002-6-111"XCharStruct structureID="IX-1002-6-112"structuresXCharStructOne XCharStruct structure contains the metrics of a

XCharStruct:  one describes the smallest measurement
for each character metric among all the characters in the font;
one describes the largest; and one points to a list of structures,
one for every character in the font.  Note that the minimum
character metrics (min_bounds) do not describe the
smallest character in the font, but the smallest of every measurement
found anywhere in the font.  The same goes for max_bounds.The following list describes in detail each member of the
XFontStruct structure.  Only font developers need to learn
all these members.  In general, an application programmer will use
only the ascent and descent members and occasionally
the min_bounds, max_bounds, min_byte1, and
max_byte1 members.  These members are placed first so you
can just scan the rest if you are interested.  Refer back to
Figure 6-4 for a visual representation of ascent and
descent.
ID="IX-1002-6-119"XFontStruct structuredescription of membersMARK="BULLET"The min_bounds and max_bounds are structures
containing the minimum and maximum extents of the characters
in the font, ignoring nonexistent characters.  The bounding
box of the font (the smallest rectangle that could contain any
character bitmap in the font), by superimposing all of the
characters at the same origin (specified by x, y),
has its upper-left coordinate at:ID="SC-1002-6-2"[x + min_bounds.lbearing, y - max_bounds.ascent]The bounding box's width is:ID="SC-1002-6-3"max_bounds.rbearing - min_bounds.lbearingIts height is:ID="SC-1002-6-4"max_bounds.ascent + max_bounds.descentID="IX-1002-6-120"max_boundsXFontStruct memberID="IX-1002-6-121"min_boundsXFontStruct memberascent is the logical extent of the font above
the baseline and is used for determining line spacing.
Specific character bitmaps may extend beyond this ascent.descent is the logical extent of the font below
the baseline and is used for determining line spacing.
Specific character bitmaps may extend beyond this descent.
If the baseline is at absolute y coordinate y,
then the logical extent of the font is between the y
coordinates (y-XFontStruct.ascent) and
(y+XFontStruct.descent-1), inclusive.direction can be either FontLeftToRight
or FontRightToLeft.  This member is a hint about
whether most XCharStruct members have a positive
(FontLeftToRight) or a negative
(FontRightToLeft) character-width metric, indicating
the preferred direction of drawing the font.min_byte1 and max_byte1 are both 0 for
single-byte fonts, since the second byte is not used.
These members can be tested to see if a font is single-
or two-byte.  If single-byte, min_char_or_byte2
specifies the index of the first member of the
per_char array and max_char_or_byte2
specifies the index of the last member.min_byte1 and max_byte1 represent the
first and last rows that exist in the font.  There
may be up to 256 rows in a font, but no normal font is
likely to need all 256 rows (256 * 256 characters).
For two-byte fonts, both min_char_or_byte2 and
max_char_or_byte2 will be less than 256,
and the two-byte character index values corresponding to
per_char array member N (counting from 0) are:ID="SC-1002-6-5"byte1 = N/D  min_byte1           /* Row offset */
byte2 = N%D  min_char_or_byte2   /* Column offset */where:
D   =   number of characters per row
                    (max_char_or_byte2 - min_char_or_byte2 + 1)
/       =    integer division
%     =    integer modulusIf the per_char pointer is NULL, then all
glyphs (characters in the font) between the first and last
character, inclusive, have the same extent and other information,
as given by both min_bounds and max_bounds.If all_chars_exist is True, then all characters
in the per_char array have nonzero bounding boxes.default_char specifies the index that will be used when
an undefined or nonexistent index is used.  default_char
is a single-byte character.  For a font using two-byte matrix
format, default_char has byte1 in the most
significant byte and byte2 in the least significant
byte.  If default_char itself specifies an undefined
or nonexistent character, then no printing is performed for
undefined or nonexistent index values.The XFontProp member of XFontStruct is provided
to allow additional properties (over and above the predefined
properties) to be associated with a font.  See LINKEND="S2-1002-6-15"Section 6.2.9, "Font Properties"

for positioning text on the screen.ID="IX-1002-6-125"XDrawImageStringLet's consider a string drawn with XDrawImageString().
XDrawImageString() draws the entire rectangle described by
the max_bounds of the font, with the character drawn in
the foreground pixel value and the rest drawn in the
background pixel value (both from the GC).  Figure 6-5
demonstrates the drawing of three strings.  The origin of the
baseline of each text line is specified in the XDrawImageString()
call.  The offset of the first line of text in Figure 6-5 is
(20 + ascent).  Subsequent lines are placed
(ascent + descent) below the origin of the first line.
For routines other than XDrawImageString()*, LINKEND="FN-1002-6-1"ID="FN-1002-6-1"The * (wildcard) notation is used occasionally in this manual
to indicate a number of events or routines with similar names.

Listed below are several routines that return either a string width
or its extent (both width and height).  Both types of routines return
the width of the specified string in pixels.  The routines that return
an extent also provide vertical size information in the form of ascent
and descent measurements for the particular string in question and for
the font as a whole.XTextWidth() and XTextWidth16()ID="IX-1002-6-134"XTextWidth16ID="IX-1002-6-135"XTextWidth

you should use the font ascent and descent (rather
than the string ascent and descent) if you will be
drawing other strings that you want lined up.  If you are seriously
pressed for space, it is possible to save a few pixel rows with
certain strings by using the string ascent and descent
measurements.Whether you center, left justify, or right justify text is
completely up to you.  The only crucial test is to see that

Draw a string into a drawable.  They require only the string,
its length, and the position of the baseline origin.  The font
in the GC is used both as a source for the graphics operation
and as a clip mask, so that pixels in the destination drawable

background pixel value defined in the GC.  This avoids
annoying flicker on many screens in clients that do a lot of
redrawing, such as editors and terminal emulators.  These routines
are very useful when you need to be able to highlight the text for
selections or to indicate that a menu choice has been made, because
the foreground and background of the GC can be swapped to redraw the
text highlighted.  Using the other text routines to do this requires
changing the background attribute of the window or copying the entire

to Expose events.  That is why the font is loaded,
a GC is created, and its font member is set to the loaded

problem.  The core X protocol and font server provides no way to
rotate text, and the XLFD provides no way to name such font

functions are very rarely needed, but you should know that they exist.
Their purpose is to allow for additional directories of fonts besides
the default, which is /usr/lib/X11/fonts on UNIX-based systems.
The font path is common to all clients of the server, so it should be
modified with care.  If the directory that contains the standard fonts
is removed from the path, neither any client nor the server can
access fonts.ID="IX-1002-6-188"font serversIn Release 5, font servers need to be added to the font path

But usually a region is either a rectangular area, several
overlapping or adjacent rectangular areas, or a general polygon.
Regions are chiefly used to set the clip_mask member
of the GC.  XSetRegion() sets the clip_mask to a
ID="IX-1002-6-194"XSetRegion
region so that output will occur only within the region.  Using
XSetRegion() is a lot easier than defining a single-plane
pixmap with the desired size and shape and then using that bitmap
to set the clip_mask with XSetClipMask(), and it
ID="IX-1002-6-195"XSetClipMask
is more flexible than the clip_mask you can set with
XSetClipRectangles().The most common use of setting the clip_mask to a region
is to combine the rectangle from each of multiple contiguous
Expose events on a single window into a single region
and clip the redrawing to that region.  This provides a performance
improvement in some situations.  See LINKEND="S3-1002-3-1"Section 3.2.13.1, "Repainting the Window" for more
information and an example.A region has an x and y offset, which is used internally when
making calculations with regions (offsets for all regions have
a common origin).  The offset has an effect if the region is
used as a clip_mask.  When making a graphics request
with the clip_mask of the GC set with XSetRegion(),
the offset of the region is added to clip_x_origin and
clip_y_origin to determine the placement of the region
relative to the destination drawable.Regions can be created with XCreateRegion() or XPolygonRegion().
ID="IX-1002-6-196"XCreateRegionID="IX-1002-6-197"XPolygonRegionXCreateRegion() creates an empty region to which rectangles
can be added with XUnionRectWithRegion() and various other
ID="IX-1002-6-198"XUnionRectWithRegion
functions that perform mathematical operations on regions.
ID="IX-1002-6-199"XPolygonRegionID="IX-1002-6-200"XDrawLinesXCreateRegion() and XPolygonRegion() return a pointer
to the opaque type Region, whose definition a program does
not need to know.  Just the pointer is used to refer to the region.
XPolygonRegion() creates a region of the same shape as
XDrawLines() would draw given the same arguments (except
that XPolygonRegion() does not require a drawable or a GC
and therefore interprets the lines as thin lines).  It specifies
a list of points and has a flag that indicates whether areas
overlapping an odd number of times should be included or not
included in the region (just like the fill_rule in the GC).Each region is implemented as a group of nonoverlapping rectangles.
Therefore, performance will be best if the regions you use have
sides parallel to the coordinate axes.  Nonetheless, nonrectangular
regions can be created with XPolygonRegion().A region is destroyed with XDestroyRegion().  The best way
ID="IX-1002-6-201"XDestroyRegion
to clear a region is to destroy it and create a new one.XClipBox() returns the size and position of the smallest

ID="IX-1002-6-222" SPAN="END"regionsID="S1-1002-6-4"ImagesID="IX-1002-6-223" SPAN="START"imagesXlib provides an image structure that is capable of storing
all the data corresponding to a screen area or pixmap.  The
major difference between an image and a pixmap is that an
image is a structure on the client side, so its contents can
be manipulated directly by the client, instead of solely through
X protocol requests.  Xlib provides the routines XGetImage()
and XPutImage() that use the X protocol to transfer the
contents of a window or pixmap into an image structure and to write
the contents of an image structure back into a window or pixmap.Xlib provides a few minimal routines for manipulating image
structures, including routines to create and initialize an empty
image structure, destroy an image structure, get a pixel, set a
pixel, extract a subimage of an image, and add a constant value
to all pixels in an image.  These routines can be relatively slow,
because they change the byte- and bit-order of the image before
performing the operation and then change it back before placing
it back in the image.  However, in some implementations of Xlib,
optimized versions of these routines will automatically be used
when the byte- and bit-order used by the server happens to be the
same as that used by the machine running the client.  This should
be quite fast but is not always available.The image-processing routines provided by Xlib are minimal--they
do not provide a complete image manipulation package.  However,
the image structure does contain all the information necessary to
implement a complete package.  An application can implement its
own routines to manipulate the image data directly.  However, this
code is difficult to write in a portable and efficient fashion
because of the large number of data formats that are possible.  LINKEND="FN-1002-6-3"ID="FN-1002-6-3"Anyone thinking of trying to write their own routines to
manipulate images should get access to the Xlib code that
manipulates images.  This code will make you think again.XGetImage() returns data that uses the byte- and bit-order
of the server.  The application will need to swap this into the
native byte- and bit-order before doing image processing.
XPutImage() takes care of swapping it back before sending
it to the server, so that the application need not convert the
data back to the server-native byte- and bit-order.  However,
XPutImage() does not convert images of different depths.The XImage data structure is shown in Example 6-9.

The format member may be XYBitmap, XYPixmap,
or ZPixmap.In XYBitmap, the bitmap is represented in scan line order,
with each scan line made up of multiples of the bitmap_unit
and padded with meaningless bits.  Within each bitmap_unit,
the bit order depends on bitmap_bit_order.In XYPixmap, each plane is represented as a bitmap, and the
planes appear in most significant to least significant bit order,
with no padding between planes.In ZPixmap, the pixels (instead of bits) are listed in scan
line order.  Each pixel has bits_per_pixel bits, and the
bits in the pixel that are allocated to red, green, and blue for
DirectColor and TrueColor are specified by
red_mask, blue_mask, and green_mask.
See LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color," for more information on these masks.  At
the end of each scan line, a pad is used as for XYBitmap.ID="IX-1002-6-230"byte orderin imageThe byte_order is the data byte order, either
LSBFirst or MSBFirst.  The bitmap_bit_order
is the bit order within each byte, again either LSBFirst or
MSBFirst.  The bitmap_unit specifies how many bits
make up a unit of image data (usually the same as the word size),
and it can be 8, 16, or 32.  Together,
these members determine the exact arrangement of bits in memory.
Figure 6-6 shows the effect of the various byte_order
and bit_order combinations assuming a bitmap_unit
of 16.  VAXes and 80*86 systems use byte_order
of LSBFirst, while 68000-family systems use MSBFirst.
Note that with these three variables alone there are 12 different
data formats.  The ImageByteOrder() and BitmapBitOrder()ID="IX-1002-6-231"XImageByteOrder macroID="IX-1002-6-232"macrosXImageByteOrder
macros return which byte order and bit order is used by the server.The bitmap_pad member can be 8, 16, or
32, and it specifies the quantum of the scan line.  In
other words, the start of one scan line and the start of the next
are separated by an integer multiple of this number.The depth of an image is assigned as the image is created.
The depth of a window from which image data is read must match
this depth.The bytes_per_line member specifies how many bytes
make up a scan line.ID="IX-1002-6-233"XImage structuredescription of membersThe bits_per_pixel member is for ZPixmap images only.
This member of the XImage structure must match the member of
the same name in the ScreenFormat structure (itself a member
of Display).The red_mask, green_mask, and blue_mask
members are for ZPixmap only and specify the number of
bits in the pixel that are allocated to red, green, and blue.

since it is transient, passing over the screen without permanently
changing it.  The cursor is drawn where the pointer is pointing
and removed as soon as the pointer moves.Each window can have a different cursor defined in its window
attributes (using XDefineCursor()).  Whenever the pointer
is in a visible window, the cursor is set to the cursor defined
for that window.  If no cursor was defined for that window, the
cursor will be the one that was defined for the parent window
unless otherwise specified in the attributes.ID="IX-1002-6-253"hotspotin cursorID="IX-1002-6-254"cursorhotspot in
From X's perspective, a cursor consists of a cursor shape, mask,
foreground and background colors, and hotspot (defined in a moment):MARK="BULLET"The cursor bitmap determines the shape of the cursor.The mask bitmap determines the pixels on the screen that
will be modified by the cursor.The pixel values determine the foreground color (the 1 bits
in the cursor bitmap) and the background color (the 0 bits
in the cursor bitmap).The hotspot defines the point on the cursor that will
be reported when a pointer event occurs.  The hotspot is the
actual tracking position--for example, the center for a
crosshair cursor or the point of an arrow.There usually are limitations imposed by the hardware on
cursors as to size, shape, and whether a mask is implemented.
XQueryBestCursor() is used to find out what sizes are possible.You need to create a Cursor resource to call XDefineCursor().
Read on for a description of the various ways to create cursors.

demonstrates this process.The cursor font is shown in Appendix I, The Cursor Font, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual,
and on the reference page for XCreateFontCursor()
in Volume Two.  Each of these cursors uses two characters in
the cursor font, only one of which is shown.  One determines
the shape of the cursor, and the other is a mask which selects
which pixels on the screen are disturbed by the cursor.  The
mask for each standard cursor is very similar to the shape for
that cursor but one pixel wider in all directions.  This means
that when the cursor is black and over a black background, this
one pixel outline of the cursor will appear in white around the
cursor, making the cursor visible over any background.

/* Now cursor will appear when pointer is in window */If your client is operating on a color screen and it allows
the user to specify window background colors, it may also allow
the user to specify cursor colors, since this could improve
contrast between the window background and cursor.  These pixel

and XCreatePixmapCursor(), or XRecolorCursor() may be
ID="IX-1002-6-263"XRecolorCursor
called for an existing cursor.XCreateGlyphCursor() allows you to do the same thing as
is done with the standard cursors but using font characters
you specify from any font.  The hotspot of these cursors and
those created by XCreateFontCursor() is the origin of
each font character (just as if it were text). Usually the
hotspot is placed in a logical location, but it is not possible
to determine where the hotspot is from within the program
or to change its location.XCreatePixmapCursor() allows you to create a cursor

can design one of your own.  It should be 16 by 16 pixels
since some servers may not be able to handle other sizes efficiently.
You can design the shape of the cursor with any bitmap editing tool
such as the bitmap program.  You will also have to design a
mask.  To see the purpose of the mask, move the cursor on your X
screen over various backgrounds (highlight some text if necessary to
get a different background).
The mask provides an outline around the cursor so that the cursor
is visible over any background.  Therefore, the design of the mask is
typically similar to the cursor shape but simpler and more dense.  The
outline of the mask usually extends one pixel more in every
direction than the cursor shape.

handling in X can be more complex than in other graphics systems because
of the need for portability to many different types of displays.
Certain advanced topics in color handling are still poorly defined in
the X standard.  This chapter starts with the basics, which everyone
working with color should read, and gradually moves to more advanced
topics, including R5 device-independent color.  Pick and choose from
the later sections as appropriate.A typical X application allows the user to specify colors for the
background and border of each of its windows, colors for the cursor, and
foreground and background colors to be set in GCs for drawing text and
graphics.  More complex applications (such as Computer Aided Design (CAD)
applications) might use color to distinguish physical or logical
layers.  Still more complex applications, such as in imaging, might use
fine gradations of color to represent real-world data.  Yet in discussing
the background and border window attributes and how to set the foreground
and background members of the GC, we have spoken only of pixel values.How are these pixel values translated to colors?  And how must an X
client manage color if it is to run successfully on the wide variety
of screen hardware available in the X environment?Because X must support a wide variety of systems with differing screen
hardware, the Xlib color-handling mechanisms are fairly complex.  Even
programmers who have previously written color graphics applications will
find there are some new concepts to learn.This chapter starts out by describing the different types of screens
that an X application may run on and the mechanisms Xlib provides for
determining the screen type.  It then describes the simplest color-allocation
mechanisms, which could be used by applications whose principal use of
color is for decoration.  It proceeds to discuss more complex color
applications and concludes with a section on writing applications that
will be portable across different types of color and monochrome screens.ID="S1-1002-7-1"Basic Color Terms and ConceptsID="IX-1002-7-1"colortermsID="IX-1002-7-2"colorconceptsID="IX-1002-7-3"RGBcolor modelMost color screens on the market today are based on the RGB color
model.  Each pixel on the screen is actually made up of three
phosphors:  one red, one green, and one blue.  Each of these three
phosphors is sensitive to a separate electron beam.  When all three
phosphors are fully illuminated, the pixel appears white to the human
eye.  When all three are dark, the pixel appears black.  When the
illumination of each primary color varies, the three phosphors generate
an additive color that might seem surprising.  For example, equal
portions of red and green, with no admixture of blue, make yellow.
Most people are more familiar with subtractive color mixing, used
in paints, where red, yellow, and blue are the three primary colors
from which all other colors (except white and shades of gray) can be made.You, no doubt, know that a color screen uses multiple bits per pixel
(also referred to as multiple planes) to specify colors.  A colormap
is used to translate each pixel's value into the visible colors you see
on the screen.ID="IX-1002-7-4"colormapsdefinitionA colormap is no more than a lookup table stored in the server.  Any
given pixel value is used as an index into this table--for example, a
pixel value of 16 will select the sixteenth element, or colorcell.
ID="IX-1002-7-5"colorcellsOn the most common type of color system, each colorcell contains
separate 16-bit intensity values for each of the three primary colors.As shown in Figure 7-1, a pixel value uniquely identifies a
particular colorcell.  Each pixel value in the visible portions of a
window is continuously read out of screen memory and looked up in the
colormap.  The RGB values in the specified colorcell control the intensity
of the three primary colors and thus determine the color that is displayed
at that point on the screen.

number of bits available in the colormap for RGB specification.
If eight bits is available for each primary, then the range of
possible colors is
256 3
(about 16 million colors).However, the number of different colors that can be displayed
on the screen at any one time is a function of the number of
planes.  A 4-plane system could index
2 4
colorcells (16 distinct colors); an 8-plane system could index
2 8
colorcells (256 distinct colors); and a 24-plane system could index
2 24
colorcells (over 16 million distinct colors).A client attempting to use color does not specify a pixel value
and the color to be put in that cell in order to draw in a given color.
Instead, it requests access to a colorcell in a colormap (managed by
the server) and is returned a pixel value.  This is called
ID="IX-1002-7-9"colorallocating (description)ID="IX-1002-7-10"colorsallocating, definitionallocating a color.  When a client allocates a color, it asks
the server, "Which colorcell can I use?" and the server responds by
saying, "You can use the colorcell specified by this pixel value."There are three basic functions that allocate colors, which are
described in detail and demonstrated in later sections in this chapter.ID="S1-1002-7-2"Color Naming and SpecificationThe following sections describe the various ways to specify what
color you want.  In programs that use color only for decoration, the
programmer simply chooses default colors, and allows the user to
override them with resources.ID="S2-1002-7-1"The Server-side Color Name DatabaseID="IX-1002-7-11" SPAN="START"databasecolor nameID="IX-1002-7-12" SPAN="START"color name databaseIn order to simplify color specification and to promote sharing
of colors, the X server provides a color database that translates
string color
names into RGB values.  Mainly this is a user convenience, since it
is easy to specify "yellow" than to figure out the RGB values for
yellow.  But it also encourages colorcell sharing.  As described
above, sharing of colorcells
can happen only if two clients allocate a read-only cell with the
exact same RGB values.  If both clients allocate a color specified
by one of the 300-odd string names, there is a much better chance of
them selecting the exact same RGB values and thereby sharing a cell
than if they use one of the
2 48
possible combinations of RGB values.Because of differences in screen hardware, the same RGB values may
generate quite different colors on different hardware.  Therefore,
server implementors were intended to change the RGB values
corresponding to each
color name to make sure that the appropriate color appears on their
screen.  This is called gamma correction.  By using names
ID="IX-1002-7-13"gamma correction
from this database, you are more sure of getting a color close to
the one you request.  If the server implementor has not provided a
gamma-corrected color database, there is no way a program can tell
exactly what color is being displayed even when it knows the RGB values.
This problem is solved with the X Color Management System, or Xcms,
which was introduced in Release 5.  Xcms provides a client-side
color database, and supports device-independent color specification.
In R5, color name strings are looked up first
with the client-side color database, and if not found then on the
server database.It is also important to note that the color names are not specified
by the X11 protocol or Xlib.  Therefore, server implementors may
change them, but more often, they will simply add to the list.
(Note that some servers allow users to customize this file.
For more information, see Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide.)Table 7-1 shows some of the color names and corresponding RGB
values in the default color database.  The complete R4 database is
extensive and is shown in Appendix D, The Server-side Color Database, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.  The text
version of this database in the standard distribution on a UNIX-based
system is in the file /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt.  The server reads
a compiled version of it.ID="IX-1002-7-14"ISO LatindefinitionID="IX-1002-7-15"color namesISO Latin encodingID="IX-1002-7-16"International Standards OrganizationISO Latin
The color names in the color database are strings in which each
character uses the ISO Latin-1 encoding.  The ISO (International
Standards Organization) Latin-1 encoding is used by virtually all workstations
manufacturers.  What this means is that the first 127 character codes
correspond to 7-bit ASCII and are the normal English characters that
appear on U.S. keyboards.  But ISO characters are 8-bit, and the
characters from 128 to 255 are used for characters with accents and
other variations, necessary for other Western languages.Server vendors should be able to supply a color database file for
each foreign language.  The RGB values would be the same, but the
names would be different.  In the English file, the entry for green
is encoded with the ISO character codes 103 (g), 114 (r), 101 (e),
101 (e), 110 (n).  In German, the same entry would be for gr¸n,
encoded with the ISO codes 103 (g), 114 (r), 252 (¸), 110 (n).
In a workstation configured for German, there will be an easy way to
type ¸.Note that keysyms also use the ISO Latin-1 standard, as shown

specify colors using device-independent color spaces or using
RGB values.
We'll show you the form of these specifications
here, then return to an explanation of the color spaces in
LINKEND="S1-1002-7-9"Section 7.9, "Device-independent Color and Xcms."A device-dependent RGB value is represented
as follows:ID="SC-1002-7-1"RGB:<red>/<green>/<blue>where <red>, <green>, and <blue> are
each between 1 and 4 hexadecimal digits.  Different
primaries may be specified with different numbers of
digits.  If fewer than 4 digits are specified, they do not simply
represent the most significant bits of the value;
instead they represent a fraction of the maximum value.
So the single digit 0xA does not mean 0xA000, but
10/15ths of 0xFFFF, or 0xAAAA.X11R5 supports an additional device-dependent color
space, called RGBi, in which each red, green, and blue
ID="IX-1002-7-19"RGBi
integer value is replaced with a floating-point
intensity between 0.0 and 1.0.  In this model,
the range of possible color values are simply mapped
onto the real numbers between zero and one.  So, for
example, 0.5 always represents half intensity of a
color.  Note that these values represent the physical
intensity of a color, which is not linearly proportional
to the perceptual intensity of that color.
A color specification for RGBi has the
following form:ID="SC-1002-7-2"RGBi:<red>/<green>/<blue>where <red>, <green>, and <blue> are
floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.Device-independent color specifications follow the
same syntax--a color space name followed by a colon and
slash-separated color space values.  The
following forms are recognized:ID="SC-1002-7-3"CIEXYZ:<X>/<Y>/<Z> 
CIEuvY:<u>/<v>/<Y> 
CIExyY:<x>/<y>/<Y> 
CIELab:<L>/<a>/<b> 
CIELuv:<L>/<u>/<v> 
TekHVC:<H>/<V>/<C> ID="IX-1002-7-20"color spacesCIEXYZ and the each of the other five strings listed here are
the names of color spaces, most of them international standards.
Each of the values in these device-independent color
spaces is a floating-point number.  Note that different
color spaces have different ranges of legal values for
each parameter.  For example, the u parameter of
the CIEuvY color space must have a value between 0.0
and approximately 0.6, while the H parameter of the
TekHVC color space represents an angle and thus varies
between 0.0 and 360.0.  Also, the valid values for one
parameter often depend on the values of the others.
In general, you will need to be
familiar with the colorimetric theory behind a
particular color space before attempting to specify
colors in that space.LINKEND="EX-1002-7-1"Example 7-1 shows this new style of color

design, kept entirely on the client side.  The X
protocol and the X server still use device-dependent RGB
colors exclusively, so it is not
possible to use the new device-independent color specifications
in the color name database read by the server.  Because
it is sometimes useful to give symbolic names to
device-independent colors, X11R5 supports a client-side
color database that maps names to device-independent
or device-dependent color specifications.Note that while X11R5 supports such a color database,
the MIT release does not provide one, other than as an
example to system administrators or users who want to define one
of their own.  The client-side color database should be
thought of as a place for site-specific customizations,
and useful, if non-standard, shortcuts for naming
colors in user resource files.  In particular, since
the contents of the database are not standardized,
application defaults files should not rely on any
particular colors to be in the database.X clients (on most UNIX systems) look for the client-side database
in the file /usr/lib/X11/Xcms.txt by default,
but the MIT sample implementation allows a different
file to be specified with the XCMSDB environment
variable.  The format of the database
is implementation-dependent.

they fall back on the pre-X11R5 behavior and attempt to parse the

supported by the pre-X11R5 Xlib functions, all X

although this is discouraged as of Release 5.The hexadecimal form of color specification is necessary in R4 for
the user to be able to specify an exact color, not just the rough
approximation allowed by an string name.  The hexadecimal specification
must be in one of the following formats:ID="SC-1002-7-4"#RGB            (4 bits each of red, green, and blue)
#RRGGBB         (8 bits each of red, green, and blue)
#RRRGGGBBB      (12 bits each of red, green, and blue)
#RRRRGGGGBBBB   (16 bits each of red, green, and blue)Each of the letters represents a hexadecimal digit.  In the shorter
formats, the specified values are interpreted as the most significant
bits of a 16-bit value.  For example, #3a7 and
#3000a0007000 are equivalent.Use of hexadecimal color specifications does not preclude colorcell
sharing, since the user could specify the same hexadecimal value for
the color for two or more clients.  However, it probably tends to make
sharing less likely, since a window manager might allocate all the
colors in the color database as read-only cells, and then any client
that uses hexadecimal specifications will probably be allocating a
separate cell instead of sharing.

actually somewhat over-simplified.  There are significant differences
in how the colormap is used on mid-range color screens, monochrome
and gray-scale screens, and high performance color screens.  Color
handling in X was designed to work with any of these hardware types.ID="S2-1002-7-5"Mid-range Color DisplaysID="IX-1002-7-39"display hardwaremid-range colorThe most common type of color screen has between four and eight planes
and uses the colormap indexing technique described above.  This type
of screen is so widespread because it provides a flexible color system
while being moderately priced.  The mapping of pixel values to colorcells,
with arbitrary RGB values stored in each colorcell, allows a very large
range of possible colors, even though a more limited number can be shown
on the screen at any one time.Mid-range color screens usually have only one hardware colormap.
In other words, the pixel values in all the windows on the screen
are mapped to colors using the same colormap.  On most of these
systems, however, the color in any colorcell in the hardware colormap
can be individually changed, and therefore, the entire colormap can
be replaced with a new set of values.  X provides the concept of the
ID="IX-1002-7-40"virtual colormapvirtual colormap, so that more than one set of colorcells can
be maintained, even though only one of them can be in use at a time.
Virtual colormaps are swapped in and out of the hardware colormap by
the window manager.  This makes it possible for an application that
has special color needs to create its own virtual colormap, which
the window manager will load into the hardware colormap when that
application is in use.  However, since only one hardware colormap is
available and all applications share it, when any one application
creates a new virtual colormap and the window manager installs it,
all other applications will screen in false colors, since the pixel
values they use now point to cells in the other client's colormap.
This is acceptable, since the window manager always installs the
correct colormap for the application in use, but it is obviously
not ideal.  On high performance systems, described below, this
problem is solved by having multiple hardware colormaps.ID="S2-1002-7-6"Monochrome and Gray ScaleID="IX-1002-7-41"display hardwaremonochromeID="IX-1002-7-42"display hardwaregray scaleID="IX-1002-7-43"monochrome displayID="IX-1002-7-44"gray scale displayMonochrome (black and white) screens have only a single plane of
screen memory.  Each pixel is made up of a single phosphor, which
can be either on or off.Gray-scale screens are sometimes used for publishing applications,
since pixels made up of a single phosphor are smaller than those
made up of three phosphors and the resolution is, therefore, better.
As shown in Figure 7-2, a gray-scale screen works by looking
up the intensity of the pixel in the colormap, which, for this screen
type, contains only a single value.  This controls the intensity of a
single electron beam.  Gray scale can be simulated on a color screen
by making the red, green, and blue values equal in a given colorcell
to determine the brightness of gray pixels on the screen.ID="FG-1002-7-2"Pixel value to RGB mapping -- gray scale and monochrome screensFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.7.02.gif" ID="GC-1002-7-3"A gray-scale screen might have a read-only colormap, so that
the gray levels in each cell could not be changed.  A monochrome
screen is an example of this type; it is a single-plane screen
with a two-element read-only colormap.ID="S2-1002-7-7"High Performance Color DisplaysID="IX-1002-7-45"display hardwarehigh performanceAs memory has become cheaper and applications more advanced,
workstations with 24 planes and more have become more common.  With
24 bits per pixel, it is possible to screen every discernible color
at the same time.  This makes it possible to do smooth shading and
other applications that use a large number of closely spaced colors.The problem with having so many planes is that a colormap of the
style used in mid-range color screens would be impossibly large:  it
would contain over 16 million entries.  Instead, the available bits
per pixel are broken down into three separate colormap indices, one
for each primary color, as shown in Figure 7-3.  This
approach still allows the full range of colors to be generated but
makes the job of loading the colormap much more manageable.  This
scheme requires three primary colormaps of only 256 entries each
to specify all 16 million colors on a 24-plane system.ID="FG-1002-7-3"Pixel value to RGB mapping -- high performance color screensFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.7.03.gif" ID="GC-1002-7-4"In high performance screens, having a read-only colormap makes just
as much sense as having it read/write, because nearly every color
imaginable can be simultaneously available.  With a read-only
colormap, there is a fixed relationship between the pixel values used
to select a color and the actual RGB values generated.  This makes
possible applications that want to calculate pixel values directly
instead of having to calculate colors and then determine which pixel
value represents that color, as is necessary when the colormap is read/write.In reality, most screens in this class let you use the color resources
in either fashion, using virtual colormaps.  There can be one read-only
virtual colormap and one read/write virtual colormap.  However, unlike
on mid-range color screen hardware, most high performance color systems
have multiple hardware colormaps, so that both virtual colormaps can be
installed and used at the same time.  In fact, on many of these systems,
each window can have its own virtual colormap installed in the hardware
at the same time.ID="S2-1002-7-8"How X Describes Color Support with VisualsID="IX-1002-7-46"screensdisplay hardwareID="IX-1002-7-47"display hardwareand visualsID="IX-1002-7-48" SPAN="START"visualsID="IX-1002-7-49"visualsdefinitionA visual describes the characteristics of a virtual colormap
that has been or can be created for use on a particular screen.  As
used by Xlib, a visual is actually a pointer to a structure (of type
Visual) containing information about one way of using a particular
screen.  A visual must be specified when creating a colormap or a
window, and the same visual must be used in creating a window as is
used to create the colormap to be used in that window.Most windows inherit their parent's visual, and windows will often
share the root window's visual, which is known as the default visual.
The default visual describes, naturally, the default colormap.  If
you create all your windows with XCreateSimpleWindow(), you will
be using the default visual and colormap.

The Visual structure is intended to be opaque; programs
are not supposed to access its contents.  This is so that Xlib
implementors can change the structure without breaking existing
clients.  The procedure used to avoid accessing its members is
not all that cumbersome but is just beginning to come into use
by application writers.  Up to this point, most programmers have
broken this rule.  We will show you only the correct method here,
since it adds only a few lines to the application.Even more existing applications have avoided visuals altogether and
used only the DefaultDepth() or DisplayPlanes() macros
to attempt to determine whether the screen is monochrome or color.
However, this does not work in general, because it does not distinguish
between gray-scale screens and color screens (both have more than
one plane).  The only way to make this distinction is to get
information about visuals.Remember that a visual is only one way to use color on a particular
screen.  There may be a list of supported visuals on a screen, with
each visual describing a different depth and writeability of the
ID="IX-1002-7-55"depth
colormap.  On a color system, there may be both monochrome and
color visuals available.The correct method to get information about the visuals supported
on a particular screen is to use XMatchVisualInfo() or
ID="IX-1002-7-56"XMatchVisualInfoID="IX-1002-7-57"XGetVisualInfoID="IX-1002-7-58"XVisualInfo structureXGetVisualInfo().  These functions return XVisualInfo

and therefore, there may be more than one supported visual.  This is
usually true of high-end workstations.  There are ways to search
through the available visuals to select the one that most closely
meets the needs of your application, as will be described later.
Several visuals of the same class may be provided but at different
depths.  On high performance screens, it is possible to create the
ID="IX-1002-7-69"depth
colormap as read/write or as read-only.  Both methods have certain
advantages and would be used for different applications.  There would
be a separate visual for each of these ways of using the screen hardware.
One of these visuals would be TrueColor class and the other
DirectColor class.  Some 24-plane screens allow the screen
to be treated as two separate 12-plane PseudoColor visuals.
(This allows for "double-buffering," a technique useful for animation,
or for storing distance data to simplify hidden line and plane
calculations in 3-D applications.)  In fact, on some advanced
workstations, you can use a different visual in each window.Figure 7-4 schematically represents the visual classes that
can theoretically be supported by each type of screen hardware.
A screen that supports the DirectColor class can
theoretically support any of the six visual classes.  A screen
that supports the PseudoColor visual class can support
GrayScale, PseudoColor, StaticColor,
or StaticGray visual classes.  A screen that supports the
GrayScale visual class can also support StaticGray
visual classes.  The three types of screen with read-only colormaps
can only support visuals of their own class.  But remember that
just because a certain visual class can theoretically be supported
by a certain screen hardware does not mean that the server
implementors will decide to support that class.ID="FG-1002-7-4"Hierarchy of visual classesFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.7.04.gif" ID="GC-1002-7-6"ID="IX-1002-7-70"virtual colormapID="IX-1002-7-71"colormapsvirtualID="IX-1002-7-72" SPAN="END"visualsID="S2-1002-7-9"Shareability vs. ChangeabilityID="IX-1002-7-73"colormapschangeable versus immutableID="IX-1002-7-74"changeable colormapsversus immutable colormapsID="IX-1002-7-75"immutable colormapsID="IX-1002-7-76"shareable colorcellsNotice that DirectColor, GrayScale, and
PseudoColor visuals have changeable colormaps, but
StaticColor, StaticGray, and TrueColor
have immutable colormaps.  Within the changeable colormaps, it
is possible to have two types of colorcells:  read-only and read/write.
The color in a read-only cell is set once by one client and from then
on can be shared by any client but not changed.  A read/write cell
can have its color changed at any time by the client that allocated
it but cannot be shared by other clients.  In immutable colormaps,
you are limited to only read-only cells.ID="IX-1002-7-77"immutable colormapsOne advantage of immutable colormaps is that all the cells are
read-only and can be shared between clients, so all the cells
are available to every client.  Immutable colormaps also make
it possible to calculate pixel values from the colors desired
without querying the server, since the mapping between pixel
values and colors is predictable.  This technique is necessary
for smooth shading and 3-D rendering algorithms.  As you will
see, this is usually not possible with changeable colormaps.
The disadvantages of immutable colormaps are that there may not
be the exact color you desire (if there are a small number of
planes) and you cannot allocate read/write cells, so you cannot
change a colorcell to change the color of existing pixels on the
screen.  To change a color, you have to redraw the graphics with
a new pixel value.ID="IX-1002-7-78"changeable colormapsIn general, the advantage of changeable colormaps is that you
can have both private read/write cells and shareable read-only
cells.  That is why PseudoColor and DirectColor
are the most useful visuals, when a screen supports them.
PseudoColor and DirectColor allow you to decide
whether your client really needs read/write cells or whether it
can use read-only cells.  Read-only usage is preferred, since
these cells can be shared by all clients, which means that the
colormap is less likely to run out of free cells.Try not to confuse the writeability of colormaps with the writeability
of colorcells.  A colorcell in a read/write colormap can be allocated
read/write or read-only.  A colorcell in a read-only colormap can only
be allocated read-only.  A changeable colormap could be made entirely
read-only if the window manager or any other client allocates all
available colorcells read-only.ID="IX-1002-7-79"read/write colorcellsadvantages ofID="IX-1002-7-80"read/write colorcellsdisadvantages ofID="IX-1002-7-81"colorcellsread/writeID="IX-1002-7-82"colorcellscompared to colormaps
The advantages of read/write colorcells, available only in
changeable colormaps, are that your program can select exactly
the color you want (as long as it is physically possible on the
screen) and you can change the color at will, which instantly
changes the visible color of everything drawn with that pixel
value if the colormap is currently installed.  Although any other
client can also change the values in a read/write cell, it is a
convention that only the client that allocated the cell should
change its contents.  You own that pixel value.  Since most
clients cannot be satisfied with having no control over their
displayed colors, this pixel value is not shareable.  That means
that if several clients that use read/write colorcells are running,
all the colorcells might be used.  Then some client will be forced
to create its own colormap, with the negative consequences described
in LINKEND="S1-1002-7-10"Section 7.10, "Creating and Installing Colormaps."ID="IX-1002-7-83" SPAN="END"colormapsdifferences of in display hardwareID="IX-1002-7-84" SPAN="END"display hardwaredifferences in for color mappingID="S1-1002-7-4"Allocating Shared ColorsID="IX-1002-7-85" SPAN="START"shared colorsallocatingID="IX-1002-7-86"read-only colorsID="IX-1002-7-87" SPAN="START"colorsallocating sharedID="IX-1002-7-88"colorsallocating read-onlySince free colorcells can quickly become a scarce resource when
clients store private color values, simple clients that mainly use
color for decoration are encouraged always to allocate read-only
colors, so that these colorcells can be shared by other clients
that allocate the same colors read-only.The returned pixel value can be used to set the
background_pixel or border_pixel attribute of a window
or to set the foreground or background member of a GC,
which are used by drawing requests.  (See LINKEND="CH-1002-4-1"Chapter 4, "Window Attributes,"
and LINKEND="CH-1002-5-1"Chapter 5, "The Graphics Context," for more information.)Read-only colorcells can be allocated with the following routines:XAllocColor()ID="IX-1002-7-89"XAllocColorReturns the index of the colorcell (a pixel value) that contains
the RGB values that are requested or that contains the closest RGB values
physically possible on the screen.  XcmsAllocColor() is the same
except that colors are specified using Xcms syntax.XAllocNamedColor()ID="IX-1002-7-90"XAllocNamedColorReturns the index of the colorcell that contains the RGB values
associated with a specified color name from the string color name
database or the closest RGB values physically possible on the screen.
In R5, XAllocNamedColor() accepts strings in Xcms syntax.
XcmsAllocNamedColor() is almost the same
except with a different style of arguments.
XcmsAllocNamedColor() also is capable of returning a symbol describing
the format found in the specified string.By convention, clients allow the user to specify colors on the command
line or in the resource database using a color name.  When the RGB
values are chosen from the color database by specifying color name
strings, sharing of read-only colorcells is much more likely than if
colors are specified as raw RGB values or using hexadecimal specifications.ID="IX-1002-7-91"XParseColorXParseColor() parses a color name string or a hexadecimal color
specification string and returns RGB values.  It can be used with
XAllocColor() or the routines that allocate read/write cells, which
will be described later.  For color names, it gets the RGB values from
the server's color database just like XAllocNamedColor().  You may
have noticed that XAllocNamedColor() is very similar to the
combination of XParseColor() and XAllocColor().  The
difference is slight:  XAllocNamedColor() can interpret color
names but not hexadecimal specifications--but hexadecimal
specifications are rarely made by users anyway.  The two-routine
combination is more often used because it allows you to separately
report errors in parsing the color specified and allocating the colorcell.Using XQueryColor() and XQueryColors() you can find
ID="IX-1002-7-92"XQueryColorID="IX-1002-7-93"XQueryColors
out what RGB values are in each colorcell.  But there is no way
to determine whether a given cell is read-only or read/write.
The only way to tell how many cells are currently unallocated
is to allocate N colors using XAllocColorCells(), using the
maximum possible N initially, then reduce N until it succeeds
ID="IX-1002-7-94"free colorcellscountingID="IX-1002-7-95"colorcellscounting free
(not recommended).  A binary search is a faster way to find N.A request to allocate a color may fail because there are no free
colormap cells and, for read-only colorcells, because no existing
colorcell contains the closest color possible on the hardware to
the exact color requested.  Applications must allocate colors by
trial and error.  The routines that allocate colorcells all have
Status return values.  If the call to allocate colorcells
returns False, the client may modify the arguments and try
again.  If repeated attempts fail, the client can settle with
BlackPixel and WhitePixel() or, if these colors are

inadequate, create a new virtual colormap.  An application with
picky color needs that cannot be satisfied can simply report to
the user that its color needs cannot be met and exit.Note that XAllocColor() works somewhat differently on dynamic
visuals (such as PseudoColor) than it does on
static visuals (like StaticColor).  On dynamic visuals,
it fails if it is unable to allocate the exact RGB values requested
(i.e., if there are no free cells and no cells already allocated with
the exact RGB values requested).  On static visuals, it returns the
cell with the closest RGB values.  The algorithm used to
determine "closest" is server-dependent.  The moral of this is
that a program must be prepared for XAllocColor() to fail.ID="S2-1002-7-10"The XColor StructureID="IX-1002-7-100" SPAN="START"XColor structureID="IX-1002-7-101" SPAN="START"structuresXColorBoth XAllocColor() and XAllocNamedColor() (as well as

}This code begins by setting variables to the default depth, visual,
ID="IX-1002-7-113"depthdefault
and colormap for later use.  If the default depth is one, then the
application is displaying on a monochrome screen, and black and
ID="IX-1002-7-114"monochrome display
white are returned.  Then the code calls XMatchVisualInfo()
in a loop to look for a color visual at the default depth--it is
called up to four times, until a color visual is found.  If none
is found, it again returns black and white, since this screen must
support only a GrayScale visual (at this depth, anyway).
Some applications may wish to allocate grays in this branch.  The
rest of the code loops through the list of color names to be
allocated, looks them up in the color database, and then allocates
them.  If either the lookup stage or the allocation stage fails for
any color, the routine prints an error and exits.  It could instead
simply fall back on black and white again; your choice.As noted in the code, the visual found might not necessarily be
the default visual.  This does not always matter, because if any
color visual is available, it is a good bet that the default visual
is also color, and so colors can be allocated without doing any
further research.  With XMatchVisualInfo(), it is difficult
to develop an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the default
visual.  This is much easier with XGetVisualInfo(), which
returns a list of available visual structures that match a set of
criteria you specify.  If you pass no criteria, it simply returns
the entire list of available visuals.  You can then search through
the list matching the visual member of the XVisualInfo
structures to the default visual.  This will be demonstrated
in LINKEND="S1-1002-7-6"Section 7.6, "Getting Complete Visual Information."The XParseColor() call specifies a color name, and the RGB values
corresponding to that name are returned from the color database in the
passed XColor structure.  This structure is then passed to
XAllocColor(), and the pixel value allocated is returned in the
pixel field of the structure.The same calls would be used to parse a hexadecimal color string.
Pink could be specified in the call to XParseColor() as
"#bc8f8f" instead of "pink".  But, as we have said
before, color names are preferred, because there is a better chance
that they will specify a color already allocated or later to be
allocated by another client.It is also possible to specify the desired RGB values explicitly.
This is good for default colors because it saves a call to
XParseColor(), but on the other hand, you might not get a
consistent color on all systems because you are bypassing the
gamma correction implemented through the color database.  Simply
declare an XColor structure and set its red,
green, and blue members to the desired RGB values.
Of course, these values can be specified as integers, hexadecimal
values, or any other way that the C language allows.  Then pass
this structure to XAllocColor().  But remember, as we have
said, it is better to use color names when allocating read-only
colorcells than to use any of these explicit RGB values.

The simplest
way is to set the GC to the GXxor logical function and draw
your graphics once to draw them and again to undraw them.  You must
grab the server between the drawing and undrawing so that no other
client changes the same pixels in between (by, for example, covering
part of the area with another window).  On a monochrome system, this
always changes white to black and black to white if you set the
foreground in the GC to 1 (setting it to BlackPixel()
or WhitePixel() is not guaranteed to work on all systems,
because either may be 0).When drawing in BlackPixel() and WhitePixel() on a
color system, the color drawn by the GXxor operation is
random if BlackPixel() or WhitePixel() are used for
the foreground pixel value in the GC.  This is because there is
no restriction on which pixel value BlackPixel() and
WhitePixel() can be on a server--they are not necessarily
1 and 0 and not necessarily different by just
one bit.  For example, the pixel value drawn if the foreground
pixel value in the GC is BlackPixel() and the pixel value
on the screen is WhitePixel() is BlackPixel() XOR
WhitePixel(), which, unless BlackPixel()
and WhitePixel()
are different by only one bit, is a third pixel value not allocated
by this client.  The colorcell identified by this pixel value might
contain black, in which case the operation would not change the screen.The solution to this problem, which works on monochrome and color
systems, is to set the foreground pixel value in the GC used in
drawing with GXxor to the exclusive OR of BlackPixel()
and WhitePixel() or by setting the logical function to
GXinvert and using a plane mask which is the exclusive
OR of WhitePixel() and BlackPixel().  All applications
that highlight graphics drawn in BlackPixel() and
WhitePixel() on a color system should use one of these two
methods.  The following example illustrates how this works using
two arbitrarily chosen pixel values (which could be BlackPixel()
and WhitePixel() or could be any two colors).Let's assume that we draw in two pixel values, which we will call
color1 and color2.  The pixel values for these could be:ID="SC-1002-7-5"color1 = 11111111111111110000000000000000
color2 = 00000000111111111111111100000000The pixel value we will use to draw is generated by taking the
exclusive OR of color1 and color2:ID="SC-1002-7-6"color1 XOR color2 = 11111111000000001111111100000000Now we set the foreground in the GC to this pixel value
and the function in the GC to GXxor and draw.
This changes existing pixels that contained color1 to
color2 and existing pixels that were color2 to
color1.ID="SC-1002-7-7"foreground =               11111111000000001111111100000000
existing pixel (color1) =  11111111111111110000000000000000
resulting pixel (color2) = 00000000111111111111111100000000The other way to do this is to set the plane_mask in the
GC to (color1^color2) and then use a
logical function of GXinvert.  This is equally effective.

visual classes, a client can allocate read/write cells.
Read/write colorcells should be allocated when:
ID="IX-1002-7-129" SPAN="START"colorsallocating read/writeID="IX-1002-7-130" SPAN="START"colorcellsread/writeMARK="BULLET"The application draws something whose color must be changed dynamically
without redrawing it.  For example, in a color mixing program, the
palette must be drawn in colors that change frequently.  If this
were done with read-only colors, cells would have to be allocated
and freed frequently and the palette area redrawn with each new
color.  However, with read/write colorcells, the steps of
allocation and color setting are separate, so that the color of
an already allocated cell can be changed at will.  Anything drawn
using the pixel value of this colorcell will change color immediately
when the RGB values in the colorcell are changed.The application needs to overlay graphics on top of other graphics
in such a way that the overlayed graphics can be erased without
disturbing the underlying graphics.  For example, in a Computer Aided
Design (CAD) package for chip design, it is often useful to overlay
the various layers of a chip in different colors on the screen.  When
one of the layers is removed, you want to avoid having to redraw all
the underlying layers.  How to do this by allocating read/write cells
will be described.The system has a huge colormap, and the application needs to set a
large number of colorcells.  The calls for manipulating read/write
colorcells allow you to manipulate multiple cells per call, whereas
with read-only cells, you are limited to one cell per call.Note that read/write colorcell allocation never works on TrueColor
or StaticColor visuals.  Therefore, on systems that only support
these visuals, an application that uses read/write colorcells cannot work.
Read/write colorcells should only be used when really needed.ID="IX-1002-7-131"XAllocColorCellsXAllocColorCells() allocates read/write colorcells.  At its
simplest, it allows you to allocate read/write cells so you can
change the RGB values dynamically.But to simply allocate just a few cells, you set the ncolors
argument to the number of colorcells desired and nplanes to
0, and all the pixel values you need will be returned in the
pixels array.  The real reason for the nplanes and
plane_masks arguments will become clear in LINKEND="S2-1002-7-15"Section 7.5.2, "Allocating Read/Write Colorcells for Overlays."
The RGB values of the allocated cells are set with XStoreColor(),
ID="IX-1002-7-132"XStoreColorXStoreColors(), or XStoreNamedColor().
ID="IX-1002-7-133"XStoreColorsID="IX-1002-7-134"XStoreNamedColorID="IX-1002-7-135"XAllocColorPlanesXAllocColorPlanes(), on the other hand, is only used when you
want to be able to vary a primary color component of graphics already
drawn without redrawing them.  It allocates read/write cells, so that
a preset number of bits are reserved for each primary color.  Primarily
for DirectColor, it also allows you to simulate a small
DirectColor colormap on a PseudoColor visual but uses
up colorcells quickly.  It treats the colormap as three separate lookup
tables, allocating ncolors*2nreds
entries in the red lookup table, ncolors*2ngreens
entries in the green lookup table, and ncolors*2nblues
entries in the blue lookup table.The following routines are used to actually store colors into read/write
colorcells once they are allocated:XStoreColor()ID="IX-1002-7-136"XStoreColorChanges the read/write colormap cell corresponding to the specified
pixel value to the hardware color that most closely matches the RGB
values specified.  LINKEND="FN-1002-7-3"ID="FN-1002-7-3"Even when storing explicit RGB values, you may not get the precise
color you specify.  For example, if the hardware colormap supports
only four bits of intensity in each primary and you specify
eight-bit values, the server will scale the values you provide to
the closest possible equivalent on the hardware.

accepts Xcms syntax (in R5 and later).ID="S2-1002-7-14"Allocating Read/Write Colorcells for Dynamic ColorsAs described above, the simplest use of read/write colors is to
allocate colorcells whose colors can by changed at any time.

nondestructively overlay one set of graphics over another.
The underlying graphics will not be visible where the overlay
is drawn, but they can be refreshed by simply setting or clearing
one or more complete planes in the drawable.  This technique can
ID="IX-1002-7-152"drawableplanes in
improve the performance of a client by reducing the amount of
complicated graphics that have to be redrawn.  It can be useful
for highlighting graphics for selection.  However, as noted earlier,
read/write colorcells can only be allocated in PseudoColor
and DirectColor visuals, so any application that attempts
to use this technique should also provide a fallback technique for
use on other visuals or in case of failure.The trick that allows drawing without destroying what is already drawn
relies on the fact that we can draw in one plane of the drawable,
changing the pixel values and therefore the color, without changing
any other plane.  This is possible using the plane_mask
component of the GC.  It is these other planes that contain the
information about the drawing that was already there.  The
disadvantage of this approach is that we have to allocate more
colorcells than we would normally need.  Some of the colorcells
will need to be loaded with duplicate RGB values.  Because of this
waste of colorcells, this technique should be used only when the
graphics being preserved are slow for the client or the server to redraw.To illustrate this trick, we are going to draw in one color (the
foreground in the GC), set the background_pixel attribute
of the window to a second color, and then draw something temporary
over the top with a third color.  LINKEND="FN-1002-7-4"ID="FN-1002-7-4"Note that the background of a window is redrawn by the server when
Expose events occur, but this does not effect the process of drawing
and removing overlays, because no Expose event will be triggered in
this process.  In other words, even though the background color is
set as a window attribute and drawn by the server, the response to
other graphics drawn on top is the same as if the background were
drawn by the application.  The background counts as a color that
must be preserved.
To do this, we need to allocate four colorcells with
XAllocColorCells().  The pixel values allocated
will look something like this:ID="SC-1002-7-8"Color             Important Bits                            Remaining Bits

that only two bits distinguish the four pixel values.  The first
pixel value is used for the foreground, and the second for the
background.  We draw overlays in the third or fourth pixel value.
Since we do not want to erase what was drawn in the foreground and
background pixel values, we use a plane mask to restrict the drawing
of the highlighting pixel value to a single plane, the one where
bits in the highlighting pixel values are set to 1.  When this
entire plane (indicated by the 1 in pixel values highlight1
and highlight2) is cleared, anything drawn in highlight1
or highlight2 disappears, and anything that was drawn in the
foreground or background will
reappear.  LINKEND="FN-1002-7-5"ID="FN-1002-7-5"To clear an entire plane, set the plane_mask of a GC to
the desired plane, and then fill the entire drawable using
XFillRectangle().
The color in the colorcell
indicated by highlight2 must be the same as the color of
colorcell highlight1 so that the same highlighting color
appears regardless of the bit already in the drawable that
distinguishes the foreground and background pixel values.XAllocColorCells() does not return these four pixel values
ID="IX-1002-7-153"XAllocColorCells
directly.  Instead it returns the arrays colors and
plane_masks that are more convenient for actually using
the overlays than a single array of pixel values.  (Each of these
arrays has the number of members that was specified in the
ncolors and nplanes arguments.)  Both arrays
consist of unsigned long values like pixel values.  One array
contains the plane masks of the overlay planes, and the other
contains the pixel values that can be used for drawing
independent of the overlay planes.  Here are the values returned
in each array after we call XAllocColorCells() with
ncolors = 2 and nplanes = 1.
These values are then used to generate the pixel values shown above.ID="SC-1002-7-9"Array Members       Important Bits                       Remaining Bits

foreground and background.  Pixel values highlight1 and
highlight2 are composed by combining with a bitwise OR
each item in the colors array with each item in the
plane_masks array.  In this case, highlight1
is (colors[0] | plane_masks[0]).  The
plane_mask in the GC used when highlighting should be set
to the OR of the members of plane_masks used to make the
highlighting pixel value.  In this simplest case, highlighting
should be done with the plane_mask in the GC set to
plane_masks[0].Note that highlight2, generated with
(colors[1] | plane_masks[0]), can be
useful.  As mentioned earlier, highlight2 can be used
interchangeably with highlight1, as long as the
plane_mask in the GC is set to plane_masks[0].
But highlight2 has another use.  With a GC that does not have
its plane_mask set to plane_masks[0] (the GC used
for drawing with the foreground or background), this fourth pixel value
can be used for drawing in the highlighting color while wiping out
the underlying graphics, so that when the highlight is removed, the
background color appears regardless of the contents of the drawable
before the highlighting.We have been hinting at the fact that this overlay technique
can be used with more than two colors and more than one plane.
ncolors specifies the number of colors than can be drawn
and preserved while drawing in the overlays.  nplanes
specifies how many separate one-color overlays you may have or how
many bits of color are available in a single overlay.  The pixel
values in the colors array are the ones that will be
preserved through overlays.  By ORing together each colors
with any combination of plane_masks, you get the pixel
values that are used for drawing the overlays.  Note, however, that
the plane mask of the GC used for the overlaying must be the OR of
the same combination of members of the plane_masks array
as were used to generate the pixel value.The total number of pixel values (colorcells) allocated by
XAllocColorCells() is ncolors*2nplanes .  Note that the more planes you try to allocate, the less likely this
request is to succeed, particularly on PseudoColor visuals.
Therefore, if you are trying for multiple overlays or one multicolor
overlay, this will probably work reliably only on DirectColor
visuals, so make sure you have a backup plan for more common systems.
In most cases, the underlying graphics can be redrawn if the overlays
that would preserve them cannot be allocated.  It is also possible to
use backing store (which can save selective planes) or to manage your
own off-screen pixmaps for use in fast redrawing of complicated graphics.ID="IX-1002-7-156"contigXAllocColorCells argument XAllocColorCells() takes a contig argument that specifies
whether the planes returned in plane_masks must be contiguous.
The contig argument is normally set to False, specifying
that the allocated planes need not be contiguous, because then the chances
of success of the XAllocColorCells() call are greater.  There are
more likely to be a number of noncontiguous planes available than the same
number of contiguous planes.  The contig argument may have to be
set to True for imaging applications that want to be able to perform
mathematical operations on the pixel values.  It is easier to perform
operations by shifting bits with contiguous planes than to achieve the
same effect with random planes.Each plane mask has one bit for GrayScale and PseudoColor
or three bits for DirectColor or TrueColor, and none of
the masks have bits in common.Example 7-4 demonstrates allocating the read/write cells for
a single overlay plane.  It implements the overlay scheme described
above.  If this overlay plan fails, it allocates three colors so
that a highlight can still be implemented even though the underlying
graphics will have to be redrawn.  If the color allocation fails
completely, it uses black and white, which can be highlighted
using the GXxor logical function to invert the color,

}The technique used for overlay planes can be used to implement a form
of double buffering.  Double buffering is a technique common used in
animation, where drawing is done in an invisible buffer which is then made
visible by a quick operation.  While the first buffer is visible, a second
invisible buffer is drawn into.  When the second buffer is drawn, it is made
visible and the first buffer invisible.  This technique allows animation
to appear smoothly without the person seeing the individual drawing operations
that were necessary to draw the pictures.Implementing this is just like overlays: one buffer is the overlay, and the
other is what we have previously considered static graphics.  The only change
in double buffering is that you draw into the invisible buffer by using
pixel values that do not change the visible colors in the visible buffer.
Then you use XFillRectangle() to set or clear all pixels in the
plane or planes that distinguish between the visible and invisible buffers.
The price of doing this is that you have much fewer colors in each picture.
For example, on an 8-plane system, you can only use 16 colors since
you have two buffers of 4 bits each.  (Also note that there is a
double-buffering extension in progress in the X Consortium.)

but in a different way than XAllocColorCells().
XAllocColorPlanes() is used when you want to be able to
change the amount of a primary color in graphics without having
to redraw them.  In other words, perhaps you are looking at an
image and would like to increase the redness of it.  The best
way to do this is to increase the amount of red in every pixel
value.  XAllocColorPlanes() would be the way to allocate
colors to allow this.  It is rarely used except in imaging
applications and 3-D graphics and will rarely work except on
24-plane workstations with a DirectColor visual.Note that for applications like a paint mixing program, in which
you have three bars for the three primary colors and a palette that
shows the mixed color, you would not use XAllocColorPlanes().
The correct way to implement this is to allocate a single read/write
color for the palette and to change it dynamically.  (If the primary
colors are displayed, they should be allocated using read-only colors.)The piece of code shown in Example 7-8 is similar to
Example 7-4 but it uses XAllocColorPlanes().
It is somewhat sketchy, because real applications that use
XAllocColorPlanes() are complicated.After allocating colors with XAllocColorPlanes(), you can
then use XStoreColors() to set the colors.  When nred,
ngreen, and nblue are each 8, only one call
to XAllocColorPlanes() and one call to XStoreColors()
are necessary to allocate and set all 16 million colors of an
entire 24-plane colormap.ID="EX-1002-7-8"Using XAllocColorPlanes() to allocate colorcells for DirectColor#define PIXELS 256

XCreateWindow() and XCreateColormap().The visualid member is not normally needed by applications.As discussed earlier, the class member specifies whether the
screen is to be considered color or monochrome and changeable or
immutable.  The class member can be one of the constants
DirectColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor,
StaticColor, StaticGray, or TrueColor.The red_mask, green_mask, and blue_mask
members are used only for the DirectColor and
TrueColor visual classes, where there is a separate map
for each primary color.  They define which bits of the pixel
value index into the colormap for each primary color.  Each
mask has one contiguous set of bits, with no bits in common with
the other masks.  These values are zero for monochrome and most
four- to eight-plane color systems.The colormap_size member of the structure tells you how
many different pixel values are valid with this visual.  For a
monochrome screen, this value is two.  For the default visual
of an eight-plane color system, this value is typically 254 or
256 (two colors are often reserved for the cursor).  For
DirectColor and TrueColor, colormap_size
will be the number of cells for the biggest individual pixel
subfield.  The colormap_size member is the same as the
map_entries member of the visual structure.The bits_per_rgb member specifies how many bits in each of
the red, green, and blue values in a colorcell are used to drive the
RGB gun in the screen.  For a monochrome screen, this value is one.
For the default visual of an eight-plane color system, this value is
typically eight.  The pixel subfields (the red, green, and blue values
in each colorcell) are 16-bit unsigned short values, but only the
highest bits_per_rgb bits are used to drive the RGB gun in
the screen.  This number corresponds the number of bits of resolution
in the Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) in the screen hardware.

color workstation, a color application should still work correctly.
The only problem might be that when colors are allocated, the closest
physically possible colors (returned by XAllocColor()) will
result in shades of gray that provide insufficient contrast.  The
best way to avoid this is to explicitly check for the StaticGray
visual.  For true bulletproof operation, it is a good idea to check
any user-specified colors to make sure they contrast.The color names "gray0" through "gray100", spelled with an "e" or
an "a", can be used with XParseColor() to get RGB values for
various grays.You should set the red, green, and blue values to be equal.  Some servers
only use one of the values, and others combine all three according to

pixel values and colors is predictable.  The purpose of standard
colormaps is to encourage sharing of entire colormaps (not just
individual cells) between applications that have too demanding
color needs to be able to allocate read-only colors out of the
default colormaps.X defines a set of properties that contain information describing
commonly used colormaps.  An application reads these properties
by calling XGetRGBColormaps().
ID="IX-1002-7-194"XGetStandardColormapID="IX-1002-7-195"XStandardColormap structureID="IX-1002-7-196"XGetRGBColormapsID="IX-1002-7-197"XSetRGBColormaps
This call returns an XStandardColormap
structure that contains enough information so that the application
can calculate the colors in every colormap cell (or a certain range
within the colormap).  This structure may also include the ID of a
colormap matching this description that was created by the window
manager or another client.  The X distribution from MIT includes
a standard client, xstdcmap, that creates the standard colormaps.
The user can arrange for xstdcmap to be invoked when the X server
starts up, or in the user's .xsession or .xinitrc file.
If this program has not been run, the application can create
a new colormap and use the information in the standard colormap
properties to allocate and set the colors according to the
information in the property.  There are functions in the Xmu
(miscellaneous utilities) library for allocating standard colormaps.But how does the sharing work?  After creating this colormap, the
application (or xstdcmap) sets the ID of the created colormap into the colormap
field of the XStandardColormap structure and then calls
XSetRGBColormaps().
ID="IX-1002-7-198"XSetRGBColormaps
This resets the property, so that the next time another client calls
XGetRGBColormaps(), the colormap field of the returned
structure will actually contain the ID of the appropriate colormap.Therefore, although an application must have the code to create,
allocate, and set colors in a standard colormap to be robust, in some
cases this code will not be executed because some other client will
have already done the work.  After calling XGetRGBColormaps(),
if the colormap field is zero, the application must create the
colormap.  Otherwise, the colormap field holds the ID of
an appropriate colormap.When an application uses standard colormaps, two (or more) instances
of the application can run at the same time without increasing the
load on the system caused by creating multiple copies of the same
colormap.  Applications that do not use standard colormaps will end
up creating separate but identical colormaps.  The window manager
will switch these in and out of the hardware colormap whenever a
different instance is in use.  Although nothing on the screen will
change color because both the colormaps are identical, the server
will be performing unnecessary installing and uninstalling, and the
extra colormaps will waste server memory.In some cases, the window manager or even the server will create one
or more standard colormaps.  This does not change how applications
work at all.  Applications do not care whether it was the window
manager, the server, or some other client that created a standard
colormap.If your application does not create or use a custom colormap,
you can skip this section if pressed for time.Applications can also use the knowledge about a standard colormap
to optimize the process of figuring out which existing pixel values
correspond to required colors and which colors must be allocated
and set from scratch.ID="S2-1002-7-19"The Standard Colormap PropertiesID="IX-1002-7-199"colormapsatomsID="IX-1002-7-200"XGetStandardColormapID="IX-1002-7-201"XStandardColormap structureID="IX-1002-7-202" SPAN="START"propertiesstandardThe standard colormap properties contain information about a few
commonly used colormaps.  However, note that even if an application
creates a custom colormap unlike any of these, it should still use
the standard property mechanism by creating its own standard
colormap structure.Properties were introduced in LINKEND="S2-1002-2-4"Section 2.1.4, "Properties and Atoms."  For a more complete
description of properties, see LINKEND="S1-1002-12-1"Section 12.1, "Properties and Atoms."In the call to XGetRGBColormaps()
you specify one of these atoms like XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or, if
ID="IX-1002-7-203"XA_RGB_BEST_MAP propertyID="IX-1002-7-204"atomsXA_RGB_BEST_MAP
necessary, one unique to your application).The following list names the atoms and describes the colormap
associated with each one:
ID="IX-1002-7-205" SPAN="START"atomslist ofXA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAPID="IX-1002-7-206"XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP propertyThis property defines part of the system default colormap.  This
colormap may be initially completely unallocated, or it may contain
a selection of read-only colorcells with the RGB values from the
color database and a few unallocated cells for use by applications
that need read/write cells.  A typical allocation of the
XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP on eight-plane screens is all the colors
produced from any combination of six reds, six greens, and six blues.
This gives 216 uniformly distributed colors and leaves 40 for other
programs or for special purpose colors for text, borders, and so on.
A typical allocation for the XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP on 24-plane
screens is 64 reds, 64 greens, and 64 blues.  This gives about
one million uniformly distributed colors (64 intensities of 4096
different hues) and leaves lots of colorcells available for other purposes.XA_RGB_BEST_MAPID="IX-1002-7-207"XA_RGB_BEST_MAP propertyThis property defines the "best" RGB colormap available on the screen.
Of course, this is a subjective evaluation.  Many image-processing and
3-D programs need to use all available colormap cells and to distribute
as many perceptually distinct colors as possible over those cells.  In
this case, there may be more green values available than red and more
green or red than blue.On an eight-plane DirectColor visual, XA_RGB_BEST_MAP
is usually a 3/3/2 allocation.  On a 24-plane DirectColor visual,
XA_RGB_BEST_MAP is usually an 8/8/8 allocation.  On other screens,
XA_RGB_BEST_MAP is purely up to the implementor of the server.XA_RGB_RED_MAP, XA_RGB_GREEN_MAP, XA_RGB_BLUE_MAPID="IX-1002-7-208"XA_RGB_RED_MAP propertyID="IX-1002-7-209"XA_RGB_GREEN_MAP propertyID="IX-1002-7-210"XA_RGB_BLUE_MAP property
These properties define all-red, all-green, and all-blue colormaps,
respectively.  These maps are used by programs that make color-separated
images.  For example, a user might generate a full color image on an
eight-plane screen by rendering an image once with high color resolution
in red, once with green, and once with blue and exposing a single
frame in a camera with three images.XA_RGB_GRAY_MAPID="IX-1002-7-211"XA_RGB_GRAY_MAP propertyThis property describes the "best" gray-scale colormap
available on the screen.

Some servers and

window managers, particularly on high performance workstations,
create some or all of the standard colormaps when they initialize.
If the desired colormap has already been created, it is returned
in the colormap member of the XStandardColormap
structure shown in Example 7-11.  If the colormap does not
yet exist, the colormap member will be zero.  In that case,
the application can create a colormap and allocate entries to match
the specification in the members of XStandardColormap,
then call XSetRGBColormaps()

The colormap member is the ID of a colormap created by the
XCreateColormap() function or the default colormap.  This ID
ID="IX-1002-7-226"XCreateColormap
can be used to install a virtual colormap into the hardware colormap.The red_max, green_max, and blue_max fields
give the maximum red, green, and blue values, respectively.  A
typical allocation that provides 63
= 216 read-only, shareable colors in a PseudoColor colormap
on a standard eight-plane workstation is red_max = 5,
green_max = 5, and blue_max = 5.  This leaves
40 cells available for special colors and private, nonshareable purposes.
ID="IX-1002-7-227"colorfor a 24-plane workstation
On a 24-plane workstation, there would be eight bits available for
each color in a TrueColor visual, which would allow 256 shades
of each primary color.  In this case, red_max = 255,
green_max = 255, and blue_max = 255.  This map
would include 2563 = 16.38 million total colors.The red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult fields
scale each pixel subfield into the proper range in the 16-bit RGB value in
the colorcell with the range 0 to 65535.  The red pixel subfield is moved
red_mult bits toward the most significant bit of the pixel value.For a 3/3/2 DirectColor allocation (eight reds, eight greens,
four blues), red_mult might be 32, green_mult might
be 4, and blue_mult might be 1 (as shown in Figure 7-5).
These effectively move the red value into the most significant bits
of the RGB value in the colorcell, the green into the middle, and the
blue into the least significant bits.  This arrangement is arbitrary
but useful.  For a six-colors-each allocation, which must be
PseudoColor since the planes cannot be evenly allocated to
separate primaries, red_mult might be 36, green_mult
might be 6, and blue_mult might be 1.The base_pixel field gives the base value that is added to
the pixel value calculated from the RGB values and scale factors.
Usually the base_pixel is obtained from a call to the
XAllocColorPlanes() function.
ID="IX-1002-7-228"XAllocColorPlanesThe visualid field is the ID of a server resource associated
with each visual, of type VisualID.  You will need this ID only
if you intend to use standard colormaps.  This field was added in R4
because only with this information can standard colormaps be used with
other than the default visual.  Prior to R4, standard colormaps were not
in wide use, partly because they could only be used with the default visual.The killid field returns a number that is used if the
application needs to free the colormap for some reason.  If
killid is greater than one, then the resources should be
freed by calling XKillClient() with the killid field
ID="IX-1002-7-229"client resourceskillingID="IX-1002-7-230"XKillClient
as the argument.  If killid is one, then the resources should
be freed by calling XFreeColormap() with the colormap
field as the argument.  If killid is zero, then no attempt
should be made to free the resources.ID="IX-1002-7-231" SPAN="END"XStandardColormap structuremembersGrayScale colormaps should be used just like color visuals
in every way.  For example, all three color fields in the

The following example
describes the 3/3/2 DirectColor standard colormap used on
eight-plane screens.  Three planes are used for red, three planes for
green, and two planes for blue.  This 3/3/2 allocation allows values
in the range of:ID="SC-1002-7-11"red    0-7    thus    red_max    =  7
green  0-7            green_max  =  7
blue   0-3            blue_max   =  3To obtain the pixel value, these RGB values must be shifted to their
corresponding planes.  If the red value is contained in the three
most significant planes or bits, the green values in the three next
most significant planes or bits, and the blue value in the two least
significant planes or bits, then the pixel can be constructed as
shown in Figure 7-5.ID="FG-1002-7-5"Shifting pixel subfields into pixel valueFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.7.05.gif" ID="GC-1002-7-7"In a DirectColor system like this, the multiples are equal to

in Release 4 to comply with the ICCCM (interclient communication
conventions, described in LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication").  Because of this, there
are two different sets of routines that manage standard colormaps,
one for use with R3 (and earlier) and the other for use with R4
(and later).  The now-outdated R3 routines are
XGetStandardColormap() and
ID="IX-1002-7-241"XSetRGBColormapsID="IX-1002-7-242"XGetRGBColormapsXSetStandardColormap(); the R4 routines are
XGetRGBColormaps() and XSetRGBColormaps().  The reason
for the plural form of the R4 routine XGetRGBColormaps() is
that it returns a list of colormaps; it also has a count
argument not present in the R3 routine.  According to the ICCCM,
only queries of the XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP standard colormap
can return more than one structure.Example 7-12 gets information about the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP
standard colormap, creates it if no other client already has, calculates
pixel values from it, and sets the colormap window attribute of the
window.
This example
gives up and falls back on read-only colorcell allocation if the
standard colormap property is not defined by the server or if creating
a colormap returns the default colormap (which happens on systems with
an immutable hardware colormap).ID="EX-1002-07-12"Code to create and use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP  .

}ID="IX-1002-7-243" SPAN="END"XA_RGB_BEST_MAP propertyThis code begins by reading the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP property
using the XGetRGBColormaps()
call.  The name XGetRGBColormaps() suggests that the function
returns a description of multiple colormaps--but this is true only
for XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP.
If this call succeeds,
the property is defined and its contents have been placed in the
best_map_info structure.  Since any other, perhaps buggy,
client might have set this property (like your own application while
you are debugging it), it is a good idea not to trust its contents
any more than necessary.  (Properties set on the root window remain
defined even after the client that set them has exited.)  The code
checks to make sure that the fields contain reasonable values before
using them.If the colormap field of best_map_info is nonzero, it
should be the ID of a standard colormap that another client has created.
Your application can immediately proceed to use the pixel values in this
colormap as though your application had already allocated them read-only,
even though in reality some other client allocated them read/write.On the other hand, if the colormap field is zero, your application
needs to create, allocate, and set the values of the standard colormap
itself.  You allocate the cells read/write, because this allows you to
explicitly set the RGB values of each pixel value.  Even though you
allocate the cells read/write, you should use them as if they were
read-only, so that other applications can share them after you reset
the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP property to include the new colormap ID.
As this suggests, a read/write cell, even though described earlier as
being private and changeable by that one client, can be public if all
the applications agree not to change its RGB values.The algorithm used to store RGB values into the cells in the colormap is
somewhat arbitrary.  Conventions for it will probably be adopted by the
X Consortium when there is more interest in standard colormaps.  Any
algorithm is good enough to allow two instances of the same application
to share a colormap.  But for two different applications to share the
colormap, each must know exactly what RGB values the other would place
in the colormap if the other were run before the colormap was created.The XGetVisualInfo() call is described in LINKEND="S1-1002-7-6"Section 7.6, "Getting Complete Visual Information."If you pass AllocAll to XCreateColormap(), you do not
need to make an XAllocColorCells() call to allocate all the
cells read/write.  However, you can use AllocAll only if you
intend the entire colormap to be read-only to all clients.  Some
clients want a few cells preserved to be rewriteable for dynamically
changing colors.  If yours is that way, you must use AllocNone
and then call XAllocColorCells() once to create the standard
portion of the colormap and again to allocate the cells your
application will treat as private.Once the colormap window attribute of a window is set, the window
manager will take care of installing the colormap.  When there is
only one hardware colormap, the window manager usually installs an
application's colormap when that application contains the pointer
(for real-estate type window managers) or is given the keyboard
focus (for click-to-type style window managers).When a window manager creates a standard colormap, it can use a
slightly different technique to make sure that the standard colormap
remains defined even after the window manager exits.  Assuming that it
has already checked to see whether some other client has created a
standard colormap and none has, it performs the following sequence of steps:MARK="BULLET"Create a new connection to the same server.Determine the color capabilities of the screen.  Choose a visual.Create a colormap (not required for XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP).Call XAllocColorPlanes() or XAllocColorCells() to

structure, including the ID of the created colormap.Call XSetRGBColormaps() to set

when you want to calculate pixel values from RGB values.Consider a 3-D display program that draws a smoothly shaded sphere.
At each pixel in the image of the sphere, the program computes the
intensity and color of light reflected to the viewer.  The result
of each computation is a triple of red, green, and blue coefficients
in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  To draw the sphere, the program needs a
colormap that provides a large range of uniformly distributed
colors.  The colormap must be arranged so that the program can
convert its RGB triples into pixel values very quickly, because
drawing the entire sphere will require many such conversions.
An example of one such calculation is shown in Example 7-13.

order to translate textual color names into intensity values for the
red, green, and blue primaries.  This is a convenience for users
and a simple attempt at device-independent color--if server vendors
tune the database
to the particular displays they support, then
applications that use the standard named colors can be
confident that those colors will appear the same across
all displays.ID="IX-1002-7-255"Xcmsmotivation forID="IX-1002-7-256"device-independent colormotivation for
In practice, however, the color database has not been
tuned for most displays.  Furthermore, there are a
growing number of visualization and other applications
that use color and shading to display data and convey
information rather than simply as
decoration.  These applications need the ability to
precisely specify device-independent colors and often
to divide a range of colors into perceptually equal
intervals.  A small number of hand-tuned named colors
in a database is simply not adequate.  X11R5 addresses
these needs with Xcms, the X Color Management System,
which was developed primarily by Tektronix for the X Consortium.

can only scratch its surface.  This section documents
the most useful and commonly used Xcms functions, but
because a complete
understanding of Xcms requires a deeper introduction to
colorimetry than is presented here, some of the more
obscure functions will be glossed over and left
undocumented.  Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual contains man pages for all the Xcms functions,
but not all of them are described here.  If you are curious about
colorimetry or need or want to know all the details of
Xcms, O'Reilly & Associates will be publishing a book
on Xcms, XCMSBOOK, by
Al Tabayoyon, Joann Taylor, and Chuck Adams of Tektronix.
It gives a more thorough treatment of
colorimetry, provides complete documentation of Xcms,
and describes how to make effective use of color in
your applications.
It should be available in late 1992.Until Release 5, X provided only an RGB system for describing
colors.  In this
ID="IX-1002-7-271"RGB
scheme, the color of a pixel is described by three
numbers which represent the intensity of the electrical
signal sent to the electron guns that excite the red,
green, and blue phosphors in a monitor.  This model is
simple from the standpoint of a systems programmer
because it is so closely tied to the physical hardware.
Unfortunately, our eyes do not perceive color
proportionally to the voltage applied to the electron
guns, so equal voltage changes over a range of red, green,
or blue intensities do not produce an equal perceptual
change.  At low intensities, a change of many voltage steps
may be required before any perceptual difference is
produced.  In addition, selecting a desired color by
additive mixing of each of the primaries is not as
simple as it sounds.  Fine-tuning a color by this
method is essentially a process of trial and error.
The RGB color model is a device-dependent color model
ID="IX-1002-7-272"device-dependent color
because it is tied directly to the physical
characteristics of a given screen--the electrical
response of the electron guns, the precise composition
of the phosphors used, and so on.  If the same RGB
color specification is displayed on two different
monitors, the resulting colors will be noticeably
different.By definition, a device-independent color
specification will result in identical displayed colors
regardless of the device that is used.  The device-independent color
representations supported by X11R5
are all based on an international standard color
representation model known informally as CIEXYZ.
ID="IX-1002-7-273"device-independent color spaces
In CIEXYZ and related color spaces, a color is
described by the value of three coordinates (as is the
case with RGB), and the color space itself is
commonly referred to by the names of its coordinates.
X11R5 supports the CIEXYZ color space, related spaces
known as CIExyY, CIExyY, CIEuvY, CIELuv, CIELab, and a
color space designed by Tektronix known as TekHVC.  The
interpretation
of the coordinates of all but the last of these spaces
is not particularly
intuitive and requires some knowledge of colorimetry.
These spaces will not be described here; instead all
discussion and examples in this chapter will use the
TekHVC color space.
ID="IX-1002-7-274"TekHVCID="IX-1002-7-275"color spaces
This is a perceptually uniform color space designed
to be intuitive.  It is mathematically related to
the CIE spaces, but is easier to describe and to
understand.  In this model, a color is
characterized by Hue, Value, and Chroma.  The Hue of a
ID="IX-1002-7-276"TekHVCHueID="IX-1002-7-277"Huecolor space
color is what distinguishes it from colors of other
color families--the blues are of different hues from
the greens, for example.  Value describes the lightness
ID="IX-1002-7-278"TekHVCValueID="IX-1002-7-279"Value color space
or darkness of a color, and Chroma describes the
ID="IX-1002-7-280"TekHVCChromaID="IX-1002-7-281"Chromacolor space
saturation or "vibrancy" of a color.  The range of
possible values for these three coordinates define the
HVC "color solid."  It is an irregular solid defined in cylindrical
coordinates with Hue as the angle, Chroma the radius,
and Value the z-coordinate of a point.  The model is
designed to make it intuitive to find a desired color.
Because the space is perceptually uniform, uniform
increments in the value of any of the coordinates of a
color result in uniform perceptual differences in
displayed colors.
LINKEND="FG-1002-7-6"Figure 7-6
shows a diagram of the
TekHVC "color solid," and a "hue leaf," the cross
section of the solid for a single Hue.ID="FG-1002-7-6"Three views of the TekHVC color solid and a single hue leaf from the solidFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.7.06.gif" ID="GC-1002-7-9"ID="IX-1002-7-282"TekHVCdiagram of color solidID="IX-1002-7-283"color spacesID="IX-1002-7-284"hue leafIn the TekHVC space, Hues near 0.0 are reds, Hues near
60.0 are oranges and yellows, Hues near 120.0 are
greens, Hues near 180.0 are blue-greens, Hues near
240.0 are blues, and Hues near 300.0 are violets.
Because the Hue coordinate is an angle, the reds near
0.0 "wrap around" to Hues near 360.0.  At any given
Hue, the legal values of Value and Chroma define an
approximately triangular area, sometimes called a hue
leaf.  For example, for the red Hues around 10.0,
colors with Chromas near 0.0 are almost grey, and as
the Chroma increases, the range of legal Values
decreases, and the colors redden, passing through
various reddish-brown shades, until around the maximum
Chroma (near 90.0) there are only a few legal Values
(near 50.0), and the colors are all bright "sports car"red.  At the same Hue of 10.0, a Chroma of 55.0 and the
minimum legal Value (near 30.0), the color is a deep
maroon, and it lightens as the Value increases until at
the maximum Value (near 65.0) it is a salmon pink.LINKEND="FN-1002-7-6"ID="FN-1002-7-6"A good way to become familiar with the TekHVC color
space is to use the TekColor Editor from Tektronix.  It
allows a user to interactively and graphically select
TekHVC colors.  It is not part of the MIT X11R5
distribution, but is available for anonymous ftp from
the host export.lcs.mit.edu in the
file contrib/xtici.tar.Z.  See the Preface for information
on how to get files from the Internet.Any color that is visible to the human eye can be
described by three coordinates in a device-independent color space,
but no given device can
display all possible colors.  Stated in another way,
all colors visible to the human eye lie within the
TekHVC color solid, but the colors that
can be generated by any particular device lie within
some subset of that solid.
Each monitor type has a
device gamut which is the set of colors it can

compression must be used to map the requested color
ID="IX-1002-7-288"gamutcompressionID="IX-1002-7-289"device-independent colorgamut compression
into a displayable color in a sensible way.  When an
Xcms function attempts to convert a device-independent
color that is outside of the device gamut to a
device-dependent color, Xlib automatically performs
gamut compression on that color, and the function
returns a special value that indicates that compression
occurred.ID="S2-1002-7-25"Screen Characterization and the XDCCCID="IX-1002-7-290"screenscharacterizationID="IX-1002-7-291"device-independent colorconverting to device dependentID="IX-1002-7-292"color spacesID="IX-1002-7-293"device-independent colorconverting to device dependentIn order for Xcms to convert from device-independent
color used by X clients to the device-dependent colors
used by the X server, it must know the characteristics
of the screen or screens connected to the server.  What
is needed is a 3 name='times' charset='iso8859-1' font='*' code=215 TeX='\times' 3 matrix to convert between the CIEXYZ
and RGBi color spaces, and a lookup table to convert
from RGBi intensities to RGB integer values.  The X
server stores this data in properties of the root
window of each screen so that the Xcms functions have
access to it without the necessity of extending the X
Protocol.  The names and formats of these root window
ID="IX-1002-7-294"X Device Color Characterization Conventions (XDCCC)ID="IX-1002-7-295"Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM)

Characterization Conventions (or XDCCC) which has
been added to the Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual (or ICCCM).  The ICCCM is printed
as Appendix L of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.ID="IX-1002-7-296"xcmsdbX11R5 provides a new client, xcmsdb, which reads
screen characterization data from a file and sets the
data on the appropriate properties.  System
administrators may configure xdm to
automatically invoke xcmsdb for every screen of
a display, or users who make use of device-independent color may
invoke it themselves.  The source
code for xcmsdb in the MIT distribution includes two
sample screen characterization data files, but the
distribution does not attempt to provide data for all
possible screen types.  If screen characterization data
is not specified on root window properties, Xlib will
fall back on default data.  This means that you can
experiment with the new Xcms features, but because the
default data will almost certainly not match your
display, the colors you see will not actually be the
device-independent colors you request.  Vendors may
make screen characterization data available in the
contributed section of the X11R5 release, but even
these will not get you truly device-independent color:
the physical characteristics of a monitor change as it
ages, so for accurate color reproduction, you will have
to have your monitor calibrated.ID="S2-1002-7-26"The Xcms Programming InterfaceID="IX-1002-7-297"Xcmsprogramming interfaceThe Xcms programming interface is part of Xlib and
contains many new functions and a number
of new datatypes, all of which begin with the
prefix "Xcms" (X Color Management System).  Some
ID="IX-1002-7-298"Xcmscolormap functions
of these new functions are close analogs to the pre-X11R5
color functions that allocate cells in colormaps and that
store and query colors in colormap cells.  Where the
existing Xlib functions operate on an XColor structure,
ID="IX-1002-7-299"XColor
the analogous Xcms colormap functions operate on an XcmsColorID="IX-1002-7-300"XcmsColor
structure that allows colors to be specified in a
device-independent fashion.  These are the functions
that will be most frequently used by programmers.There is a group of Xcms functions used to manipulate
an Xcms datatype known as a "color conversion context"or CCC.  In X11R5, every colormap has an associated CCC
which contains attributes that control the details of
the conversion of colors from one color space to
another.  Default CCCs are automatically handled by
Xcms, and many programmers will never have to use them
explicitly.  The theory behind color conversions is
complicated, and so only the simplest and most
useful of the CCC functions are documented here.ID="IX-1002-7-301"Xcmsgamut-querying functionsID="IX-1002-7-302"functionsgamut-querying
Xcms also provides a number of functions to query the
boundaries of the device gamut.  This means that
programmers can ensure that allocated colors
will be displayable (without gamut
compression) on a given screen.  Or it
means that programmers can query the most vibrant shade of
a color displayable on a particular device.  The gamut-querying
functions that operate with the TekHVC color
model are fully documented in this book.  Because
other color spaces have not been described in any
detail in this chapter, those gamut-querying functions
that operate in color spaces other than TekHVC are not
documented here.Finally, Xcms provides functions that allow the
extension of Xcms by adding new color spaces and
support for new types of display devices.  These
functions are not documented here.  See
XCMSBOOK for full documentation of
these functions as well as all the color conversion
context functions and the gamut-querying functions.Note that Xcms functions require significantly more
computation that their device-dependent analogs.
In particular, they require trigonometric and other
floating-point operations.  In the MIT distribution,
the standard math library is not used.  Instead, the
floating-point operations are implemented in Xlib
directly.  Because these functions cannot take
advantage of floating-point hardware and do not have
the efficiency of a highly optimized math library,
they are relatively slow.  As a result,
adding Xcms functions to a program can add noticeable
delays, particularly when
gamut compression occurs.
ID="IX-1002-7-303"math libraryusing standard
You can force the Xcms functions to use the standard
math library by editing the macros defined in
mit/lib/X/Xcmsint.h and rebuilding Xlib.ID="S3-1002-7-1"Color and Colormap FunctionsID="IX-1002-7-304"colormapsfunctionsID="IX-1002-7-305"functionscolormapID="IX-1002-7-306"colormap cellsqueryingID="IX-1002-7-307"queryingcolormap cellsXcms provides the following functions for setting or

}LINKEND="EX-1002-07-16"Example 7-16 has one serious weakness:  no checking is
performed to ensure that the minimum and maximum Values
passed to the procedure are valid.  This is
particularly important because the range of valid
Values depends on both Hue and Chroma.  If either of
the specified Values is outside the boundaries of the
TekHVC color space, or outside the gamut of the
device being used, gamut compression will occur on the
allocated colors.  Later in this section, we develop a
refinement to this example that allocates shades, all of
which are within the gamut of the device.ID="S3-1002-7-2"Color ConversionID="IX-1002-7-332"colorconversionID="IX-1002-7-333"color conversion contextCCCID="IX-1002-7-334"CCCID="IX-1002-7-335"XcmsCCCID="IX-1002-7-336"functionscolor conversionIn X11R5, each colormap has a color conversion
context automatically associated with it.  A color
conversion context, or CCC, is an opaque structure of
type XcmsCCC.  It contains the attributes that
control the details of color conversion from one color
space to another.  These attributes include the
procedure that is called to perform gamut compression
when a device-independent color specification is
outside the range of displayable colors for a
particular device.Xlib contains functions to create and destroy CCCs, set
and get CCC attribute values, and associate a CCC with
a colormap.  Because the colorimetric theory behind
these CCC attributes is beyond the scope of this
chapter, these functions will not be described here.
Many programmers will never have to use CCCs at all.
Others may use CCCs, but will never use anything but
the default CCC.  This section describes the CCC
functions that are useful to this second category of
programmer.Because every colormap has a CCC associated with it,
all of the Xcms functions described so far have had an
implicit CCC argument.  The functions that will be
described in the next section, however, do not require
a colormap argument but are passed a CCC directly.  For

these functions, you may obtain the CCC of a colormap
with the function XcmsCCCOfColormap(), or you may
obtain the default CCC of a screen with
XcmsDefaultCCC().The color conversion context controls the details of
color conversions performed by other Xcms functions.
It can also be used to control the explicit conversion
ID="IX-1002-7-342"XcmsConvertColorsID="IX-1002-7-343"colorconversion
of colors with the function XcmsConvertColors().
This function takes a CCC as an argument, along with an
array of XcmsColor structures and converts
those colors to a single specified target format.The functions XcmsCCCOfColormap(),
XcmsDefaultCCC(), and XcmsConvertColors()
are documented in the reference section of this book.

that there are hardware colormaps and virtual colormaps, but we
did not discuss the ramifications of this fact.A hardware colormap is a physical register from which the screen
hardware reads the RGB intensity values that generate the colors
on the screen.  Most workstations have only one hardware colormap,
in which case all windows on the screen are interpreted using the
same colormap.  Some high performance workstations have multiple
hardware colormaps, in which case separate windows may have their
own independent hardware colormaps.If the hardware colormap cannot be changed, it is termed immutable.
Monochrome systems normally have an immutable colormap, since it does
little good to swap the two entries or make them both black or white.
Some low-cost color systems and some X terminals have immutable hardware
colormaps.  The StaticColor, StaticGray, and
TrueColor visuals are the only visuals that can possibly
work on systems that have immutable hardware colormaps.  In immutable
colormaps, no client can allocate private colorcells and all RGB
values are preset.  On these systems, XCreateColormap() succeeds,
but it just gives you another copy of the default colormap (or one of
the default colormaps if there are multiple immutable colormaps).  The
application should check for this when creating colormaps.On most color workstations, you can write new values into the hardware
colormap or colormaps to change that mapping.  These hardware colormaps
are termed changeable.  The DirectColor,
GrayScale, and PseudoColor visuals are available only
on systems that have changeable colormaps.X manages multiple colormaps by keeping virtual colormaps in
memory and installing them as instructed by the window manager.
Installing a colormap is the process of moving a virtual
colormap into the hardware colormap.  Only installed colormaps
are used to determine the colors appearing on the screen.  When
there is only one hardware colormap and a new virtual colormap
is installed, the virtual colormap that was previously installed
becomes uninstalled.
ID="IX-1002-7-390"virtual colormapdefinition ofID="IX-1002-7-391"colormapsvirtualUp to this point in this chapter, we have been allocating colors
out of the default colormap, which is created and installed when
the server starts up.  On the most common color workstations, with
four to eight planes, it is quite easy for clients that require
precise colors to allocate all the available colorcells.  Virtual
colormaps are a response to this problem.  When a client cannot get
the colorcells it needs from the installed colormap, it can create
a new virtual one.  The window manager will then install this virtual
colormap when this application is in use.When a virtual colormap is installed and there is only one hardware
colormap, all the clients that used the old colormap will be displayed
in false colors, since the pixel values in their windows will be
interpreted according to the new colormap.When an application creates a virtual colormap, it must set the
colormap window attribute of its top-level window so that the window
manager can find out what colormap to install.  By default, this
attribute indicates the default colormap.  If its subwindows use
different colormaps from the main window, there is a property that
can be set to tell this to the window manager, as described
in LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."ID="IX-1002-7-392"window managerand colormapsID="IX-1002-7-393"colormapsand window manager
It is a hard rule that an application should never install
its own colormaps.  This is required by the current conventions
described in LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."ID="IX-1002-7-394"colormapscreatingBy now you should be getting the idea that it is much better to
arrange to share the default colormap with the other applications
than to try to create one of your own.  The only time when you
should really need to create a special colormap is when you are
doing smooth shading or similar applications that need many
strangely distributed colors.  On the other hand, creating a
virtual colormap might be the only way to make your application
that has demanding color needs work on a system that provides
only a PseudoColor visual.  On systems with multiple
hardware colormaps, you can create your own colormap and have
it installed without affecting other applications.  You can use
XListInstalledColormaps() to get information about how
ID="IX-1002-7-395"XListInstalledColormaps

visual.  If no entries are allocated, they can be allocated
either as read/write or as read-only cells.  If all entries are
allocated read/write,
the colormap is completely private and just
needs its colors set with XStoreColors().XFreeColormap()ID="IX-1002-7-399"XFreeColormapUninstalls the specified virtual colormap and frees the resources

and frees those entries of the old colormap.  This is used when
colorcell allocation fails and some cells have already been allocated.
It saves needing to create a colormap and start from the beginning
allocating colors.  For applications with special color needs that
can't make do, they can call XCopyColormapAndFree(), set their
colormap window attribute, and continue allocating colors in the new
colormap where they left off.XSetWindowColormap()ID="IX-1002-7-402"XSetWindowColormapSets the colormap window attribute of a window.The following functions are use by the window manager to install and

colormap.  Removes a virtual colormap from the set of installed
hardware colormaps.  On systems with only one hardware colormap,

of colormaps, which affects what happens when other colormaps are
installed or uninstalled.  Here is what the protocol specification
says about the required list (translated into Xlib terms):At any time, there is a subset of the installed maps, viewed as an
ordered list, called the required list.  The length of the required
list is at most min_maps, where min_maps is a member
of the Display structure.  The required list is maintained as
follows.  When a colormap is an explicit argument to XInstallColormap(),
it is added to the head of the list, and the list is truncated at the
tail if necessary to keep the length of the list to at most min_maps.
When a colormap is an explicit argument to XUninstallColormap()
and it is in the required list, it is removed from the list.  A colormap
is not added to the required list when it is installed implicitly by the
server, and the server cannot implicitly uninstall a colormap that is
in the required list.In less precise words, the min_maps most recently installed maps
are guaranteed to be installed.  This number will often be one; clients
needing multiple colormaps should beware.ID="S1-1002-7-11"Miscellaneous Color-handling FunctionsThe following miscellaneous functions provide additional ways to
use the color database, to find out the RGB values in a colormap
cell, and to free cells that are no longer needed:XLookupColor()ID="IX-1002-7-415"XLookupColorID="IX-1002-7-416"XcmsLookupColor
Looks up a string color name in the color database and returns
separate color structures containing the exact RGB values specified
in the database for that name and the closest RGB values available
on the hardware.  This function does not look at any cells in the
colormap, even though it has a colormap argument!  This
argument specifies which screen the color should be looked up on,
which is relevant only if each screen has a different color
characterization or color database.
The difference between XLookupColor() and XParseColor()
is that XParseColor() accepts the hexadecimal color specification
(which XLookupColor() does not), while XLookupColor()
returns the closest colors available on the hardware (which
XParseColor() does not).  XLookupColor() might be
useful for making sure that user-specified colors are contrasting.
There is also an Xcms version, XcmsLookupColor(), that
is analogous to XLookupColor() except with different arguments
and the Xcms version returns a device-independent color specification.XQueryColor()ID="IX-1002-7-417"XQueryColorID="IX-1002-7-418"XcmsQueryColor
Fills an XColor structure with the RGB values corresponding to
the colormap cell indicated by a pixel value.  Also sets the flags
member of the structure to (DoRed | DoGreen | DoBlue).
The Xcms version, XcmsQueryColor(), translates the current RGB
values in the colormap cell into a device-independent specification.XQueryColors()ID="IX-1002-7-419"XQueryColorsID="IX-1002-7-420"XcmsQueryColors
Fills multiple XColor structures with the RGB values and flags
corresponding to the colormap cells indicated by a pixel values.  Also
sets each flags member to (DoRed | DoGreen | DoBlue).
The Xcms version, XcmsQueryColors(), translates the current RGB
values in the colormap cells into device-independent specifications.XFreeColors()ID="IX-1002-7-421"XFreeColorsFrees the colormap cells associated with the given pixel values and/or
frees the given planes.  Since all the colorcells an application allocates
are freed when the application exits, this routine is needed only when an
application is finished with cells before it exits.  Freeing a read/write
colorcell makes that cell available to other applications.  Freeing a
read-only cell may make the cell unallocated, but only if no other
application is sharing that cell.ID="CH-1002-8-1" NUMBER="8"EventsEventsThis chapter is another must-read.  Events are central to X.  The
fundamental framework for handling events was given in Chapter 3, but
this chapter gives much more detail, both on selecting events for a
window and on handling them when they arrive.  It discusses each of
the masks used to select events; for a description of the event
structures themselves, see Appendix E.ID="IX-1002-8-1"inputgeneral discussionID="IX-1002-8-2"eventsAn event, to quote the Oxford English Dictionary, is an
"incident of importance" or a "consequence, result, or
outcome."  This definition holds for X.  An event reports
some device activity or is generated as a side effect of
an Xlib routine.From a programmer's point of view, an event reports:MARK="BULLET"Something that your program needs to know about, such as user
input or information available from other clients.Something your program is doing that other clients need to know
about, such as making text available for pasting to another client.Something the window manager needs to know, such as a request
by your program for a change to the layout of the screen by
mapping a window.Programming with events is quite different from traditional
methods of programming for input.  You cannot simply wait for
a user to type something and expect nothing else to happen
in the meantime.  Other programs are running concurrently and
sharing the same system resources including the screen.  They
can affect your program.  What happens if another window is
placed over yours in the middle of the instruction your user
is typing?  The program must be able to listen to several types
of events at once and jump back and forth when acting on them.
Events imply a philosophy that the program should respond to
the user's actions, not the other way around.  Events make this
type of programming straightforward.Events occur asynchronously and get queued for each client
that requested them.  It is possible for more than one
client to get copies of the same event.  Usually a program
handles each one in turn and performs the appropriate action
before reading the next one.  But there is usually no way for
a program to predict in what order it will find the events
on the queue.This chapter covers events in detail, going further than the
introduction to events in LINKEND="CH-1002-2-1"Chapter 2, "X Concepts."  Here we
discuss the event union and structure types, the selection and
propagation of events, how each event type is usually used,
how events are received and handled in a program, and how they
are sent by one client to another.After you have read and understood this chapter,
see LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer," which demonstrates
how to use events to handle the user's input, and
Appendix E, Event Reference, which describes all the
event types in a reference format.
ID="IX-1002-8-3"input exposure eventID="IX-1002-8-4"eventsID="S1-1002-8-1"Overview of Event HandlingID="IX-1002-8-5"eventshandlingThere are three important steps in a program's handling of events.
First, the program selects the events it wants for each window.
Then it maps the windows.  Finally, it provides an event loop
which reads events from the event queue as they occur.This process is quite simple, the only complication being the
variety of events that may occur, each perhaps having a different
meaning when it occurs in a different window.  You have to know
every circumstance in which a particular event is generated and
make sure that your program does the right thing with it.  But
you will not need to understand the details of every event in
order to begin using the most important ones.The easiest way to select events is to call XSelectInput()
for each window that you want to receive events.  You can also
set the event_mask attribute directly with
XChangeWindowAttributes() or XCreateWindow().
You specify a mask which specifies which event types you want,
combining any number of the event mask symbols with the bitwise
OR operator (|).ID="IX-1002-8-6"visibilitybefore event handlingYou must make sure that every window that is to receive events
appears on the screen after the events are selected for that
window but before the event loop begins.  Otherwise, the client
will miss the first Expose event that triggers the drawing
of the window's contents.  For top-level windows, the client might
also miss the ConfigureNotify event that reports the size
of the window granted by the window manager.  For a window to
appear on the screen, it must be mapped and all its ancestors must
be mapped.  It is permissible to map all the windows except the
top-level ones at any time, but the mapping of children of the
root window must be done between the XSelectInput() call
and the routine that gets events for the event loop.A simple event loop was shown in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."
The only difference between this loop and the loops in
real clients is in the number of different event types
handled and the complexity of each branch.Even though selection of events must be done first, we are
going to start by describing how to handle events once
you have them, because there are fewer details involved.  We
will return to the exact procedure for selecting events and
the meaning of each event mask symbol in LINKEND="S1-1002-8-3"Section 8.3, "Selecting Events."ID="S1-1002-8-2"Event ProcessingThis section describes what an event type is and what an event
structure contains, reviews how the event queue stores events
and how a program reads events from it, and summarizes all the
routines that can be used to get events.ID="S2-1002-8-1"The Event StructuresID="IX-1002-8-7"eventsID="IX-1002-8-8"event structurecommon membersAn event is implemented as a packet of information stored in
a structure.  The simplest event structure is shown in
Example 8-1.ID="EX-1002-8-1"The XAnyEvent structuretypedef struct {
   int type;               /* The type of event */
   unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
   Bool send_event;        /* True if sent from a SendEvent request */
   Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
   Window window;          /* Window that receives event */
} XAnyEvent;There are 30 different event structures.  Virtually all
of them have the members shown in the XAnyEvent
structure.  Most of the event structures also contain
various additional members that provide useful information
for clients.  The first member of every event structure,
ID="IX-1002-8-9"XEvent unionID="IX-1002-8-10"eventstypes event typestype, indicates the type of event.  We will come back
to the type in LINKEND="S2-1002-8-2"Section 8.2.2, "Event Types and XEvent Union."  The serialID="IX-1002-8-11"eventsserial numberID="IX-1002-8-12"serial numberof event
member identifies the last protocol request processed by the
server, for use in debugging.  The send_event flag
indicates whether this event was sent from the server
ID="IX-1002-8-13"eventssend_event flagID="IX-1002-8-14"send_event flag of event structures
(False) or from another client (True).  Other
clients can send events with XSendEvent(), as described
in LINKEND="S1-1002-8-4"Section 8.4, "Sending Events."ID="IX-1002-8-15"eventsdisplay memberID="IX-1002-8-16"eventsroot memberID="IX-1002-8-17"rootevent component
Many of the event structures also have a display member
or a root member or both.  The display member
identifies the connection to the server that this event came
from.  (Some applications connect with more than one server.)
The root member indicates the screen on which the event
occurred (a server may control more than one screen).  Most programs
only use a single screen and therefore do not need to worry about
the root member.  The display member can be useful
for passing the display variable into routines by simply passing
a pointer to the event structure.ID="IX-1002-8-18"windowevent componentID="IX-1002-8-19"eventswindow member
Most event structures also have a window member,
ID="IX-1002-8-20"eventsstructure
which indicates the window that selected and received the
event.  This is the window where the event arrives if it
is a keyboard or pointer event and has propagated through
the hierarchy, as described in LINKEND="S2-1002-8-9"Section 8.3.2, "Propagation of Device Events."  One event
type may have two different meanings to a client, depending
on which window the event appears in.ID="S2-1002-8-2"Event Types and XEvent UnionAll the event structures are padded when necessary to be the
ID="IX-1002-8-21"XEvent unionID="IX-1002-8-22"unionXEvent
same size.  The XEvent union contains all the event
structures, as shown in Example 8-2.  LINKEND="FN-1002-8-1"ID="FN-1002-8-1"See a C language tutorial or reference manual if you are
unfamiliar with unions.
The first member of the XEvent union is the type of event.
Each event structure within the XEvent union also begins
with the type of event.  A client determines the type of event by
looking at the type member of XEvent.  Then the
client branches to specific code for that event type.  After the
initial determination of the event type, only the event structure
containing the specific information for each event type should be
used in each branch.  For example, assuming you have declared an
XEvent variable called report, the
report.xexpose structure should be used within the branch
for Expose events.  This lets you use the fields unique
to the Expose event structure.The value of type is any one of the constants listed in the
center column of Table 8-3, presented later in this chapter.
After determining the event type, you know which event structure
from the XEvent union contains specific information about
the event.  You can then use the appropriate event structure name,
such as xkey, to access the specific information unique
to that event structure.  The event structure name is also shown
on each event reference page in Appendix E, Event Reference.

order they occur, so that the program can read them and
act accordingly.  As shown in Figure 8-1, the server
maintains one event queue, on which all events are placed,
and distributes events to the Xlib in each client.  The events
in the server's queue are periodically transferred over the
network to the Xlib queues.  Two clients can receive copies
of the same events if they each select them.ID="FG-1002-8-1"The server's event queue and client's event queueFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.8.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-8-1"The client sets up an event-receiving loop to handle the events
that arrive on its event queue.  There are several routines a
client can use to get events.  They differ in how many windows
they monitor, how many types of events they look for, and whether
they wait for events to appear before returning.  For a description
of the event-getting routines, see LINKEND="S2-1002-8-6"Section 8.2.6, "Routines that Get Events."ID="S2-1002-8-4"Writing the Event LoopID="IX-1002-8-28" SPAN="START"eventshandlingIn basicwin (the example program in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program"),
you have already seen the structure of the code you should write
to handle events.  In a more complex application, the code for
each event type will simply be divided according to the values
in the members in each event structure.  Usually, the next branch
after the event type will test the window in which the event occurred.The branch for Expose events in Example 8-3
demonstrates how an event might be handled when there are several
windows involved.  The example also notes when each of the selected
events--and the events that may be delivered without your selecting
them--should be handled within your event loop.  Depending on your
application, other events might need to be handled as well.Notice how the specific event structure names such as xexpose
are used to access information in the event structures.ID="EX-1002-8-3"An event-handling loopXEvent report;

ID="IX-1002-8-29"XNextEvent
for our client or waits until one appears before returning.  There
are many other routines that get events of particular types, in
particular windows,
with or without waiting for the event to appear.
These routines are described in LINKEND="S2-1002-8-6"Section 8.2.6, "Routines that Get Events."The first member of the XEvent report contains the
type of event.  This information is used in a "switch" statement
to branch according to the event type.  Once the type is known,
the specific event structure is known, and its contents can be
accessed.  For example, the width of the exposed area in the
window is contained in the XExposeEvent structure as
report.xexpose.width, where report is the
XEvent variable, xexpose is the member of the
XEvent union, and width is a member of the
XExposeEvent structure type.ID="S2-1002-8-5"Printing the Event TypeID="IX-1002-8-30"eventsprinting the typeID="IX-1002-8-31"printing event typesWe recommend that you print the event type and perhaps other
event information in each branch of the event loop while you are
in the application debugging stage.  Be very careful that the loop
handles all the events that can occur and that the Xlib routine
you choose to get events is capable of getting all the events you
need.  If your program hangs and cannot be interrupted with CTRL-C,
it is probably waiting for an event that you did not select.  For
example, you may have called XMaskEvent() with a mask of
ButtonReleaseMask but you did not select ButtonReleaseMask
in the XSelectEvent() call.  The event-getting routines do not
check to make sure you have selected the events you are requesting.Instead of printing the event type as a number which you then
have to interpret using the <X11/X.h> include file, you
can have your program print the real name of the event.
Example 8-4 creates an include file containing an
array of strings spelling out the event type names.

more legibly.  You could use a similar method to identify windows,
but since their IDs are not constants, you would need to load the

that get input:  those that wait for a matching event and those
that do not wait.  The latter may be used in porting applications
that use the "polling" style of programming, which checks to see
if input has arrived at regular intervals by continuously calling
a "polling" function in a loop.  Given the choice, however, it is
much better to use the routines that wait for events as much as
possible, since this technique does not waste processor cycles.
This is true event-driven programming.Table 8-1 organizes the event-receiving functions according

to Table 8-1 can be simulated with other routines and fairly
simple code.  The hole on the top row can be filled by calling
XCheckMaskEvent() with a mask set to all 1's.  For the four
routines missing in the last column, you can write a predicate
procedure and call XPeekIfEvent().  An
example predicate procedure is shown in Example 8-6.  The
two routines missing in the first column can also be replaced
with a predicate procedure and XIfEvent().The event-getting routines with Check in their names are
useful for programs that need to poll for input to handle interrupts.
To illustrate the handling of interrupts, let's say you have a routine
in a program that performs a complex, lengthy calculation like a
Fourier transform.  You want to be able to abort the calculation
midway.  Therefore, you need to be able to check the keyboard to see
if a CTRL-C or other interrupt character has been typed.  You also
might want to provide for exposure events during the long wait, though
you might be able to get away without this provision.  This would be a
good application for XCheckTypedEvent() or XCheckTypedWindowEvent(),
since these routines poll without waiting if no events can be read.
When an event does arrive, you can decide from the type or window
whether to bother processing it.ID="S2-1002-8-7"Predicate ProceduresID="IX-1002-8-53"predicate proceduresID="IX-1002-8-54"eventspredicate proceduresThe routines XCheckIfEvent(), XIfEvent(), and
ID="IX-1002-8-55"XCheckIfEventID="IX-1002-8-56"XIfEventID="IX-1002-8-57"XPeekIfEventXPeekIfEvent() allow you to supply a procedure that returns
True or False depending on some characteristic
of the event.  You would use one of these routines if you have
a matching algorithm that is complicated or simply to enable you
to clear up the code by putting some of the event processing in
a separate routine.Your predicate procedure is called with the same arguments as the
event-getting routine (except for the predicate procedure pointer,
of course).  Example 8-6 shows a predicate procedure and
the XIfEvent() call that uses it.  This code would normally
use XNextEvent(), but we have substituted XIfEvent()
so that we can filter out button events on buttons other than
button 1.  This predicate procedure returns True for all

wants placed in its queue when they occur in that window.
This is normally done with XSelectInput(), which sets
the event_mask attribute of a window.  The client
need not select events on all of its windows, only those
in which it wants to see the events that occur.To select event types for a window, pass an event_mask
as an argument to XSelectInput() or set the event_mask
member of the XSetWindowAttributes structure and call
XChangeWindowAttributes() or XCreateWindow().  (For

the window will not receive the first Expose event that

to redraw the window.  You will remember from basicwin that
an Expose event signifies that a window has become visible
and needs to be redrawn.  Every Expose event, including the
first, should trigger the drawing of the window's contents.
ID="IX-1002-8-75"XSelectInputAlso, note that you cannot add to the selected events by calling

group of event types should be queued when they occur.  For example,
when used alone as an event_mask argument to XSelectInput(),
a KeyPressMask symbol indicates that only KeyPress events
ID="IX-1002-8-78"KeyPress eventID="IX-1002-8-79"eventsKeyPress
are desired.  A FocusChangeMask symbol, on the other hand,
ID="IX-1002-8-80"FocusChangeMask
indicates an interest in two types of events:  FocusIn and
FocusOut.
ID="IX-1002-8-81"FocusIn eventID="IX-1002-8-82"FocusOut eventID="IX-1002-8-83"eventsFocusInID="IX-1002-8-84"eventsFocusOutID="IX-1002-8-85"ButtonMotionMask event maskID="IX-1002-8-86"MotionNotify eventID="IX-1002-8-87"eventsMotionNotify
On the other hand, there is more than one event mask symbol
for MotionNotify events; the different masks specify
the conditions under which pointer motion events are desired.
For example, if both Button1MotionMask and
Button3MotionMask symbols are combined to form an
event_mask argument to XSelectInput(), only one
event type is requested:  MotionNotify events.  However,
this event type will be queued only if the pointer moves while
the first or third button (or both) is held down.Table 8-3 lists each event mask, its associated event types,
and the associated structure definition.  The structures for each
event type are described in Appendix E, Event Reference.

the end of this table, because the X server or another client can
send them to any client without them being selected.  For example,
MappingNotify indicates that the keyboard mapping
ID="IX-1002-8-90"MappingNotify eventID="IX-1002-8-91"eventsMappingNotify
(see LINKEND="S3-1002-9-4"Section 9.1.2.3, "Keycodes to Keysyms") or pointer mapping has changed.  This
event is reported to all clients by the server when any client
changes those mappings.  The selection events are a means of
interclient communication, where one client announces with an
ID="IX-1002-8-92"interclient communication
event that it has a selection of text or graphics available for
pasting, and another client responds with an event specifying
in what format it would like the information.  Similarly,
ClientMessage events are always selected because they
ID="IX-1002-8-93"ClientMessage eventID="IX-1002-8-94"eventsClientMessage
are sent from one client directly to another using the
XSendEvent() routine.Also note that SubstructureNotifyMask and
ID="IX-1002-8-95"SubstructureNotifyMaskStructureNotifyMask select the same event types but on

Which window is reported in the event on the queue depends
on the results of propagation up through the window hierarchy
and is controlled by the event_mask and
do_not_propagate_mask window attributes.ID="IX-1002-8-119"source windowfor eventsThe source window is the lowest visible window in the
hierarchy that encloses the pointer when the device event occurs.

It is also the smallest visible window enclosing the pointer.
The window member of the event in the queue (the event
window) will be the source window only if the event_mask
attribute (set with XSelectInput()) of the source window
selected the event's type.If the event was not selected for the source window, then
the event is sent to the parent and so on until the event
arrives at an ancestor window that has selected the right
event type.  The ID of this window is then placed in the
window member of the event structure and that structure
is placed on the queue for this client.  Once a window that has
selected the event is found, the event no longer propagates.
If no window selected the event anywhere in the hierarchy up to
and including the root window, the server never sends the event.ID="IX-1002-8-123"do_not_propagate_mask attributeID="IX-1002-8-124"attributesdo_not_propagate_mask
The do_not_propagate_mask window attribute also gets
involved in this process.  When an event arrives at a window but
finds it has not been selected, the do_not_propagate_mask
determines whether the event will be sent to ancestor windows.
By default, all events that can propagate do.  If the mask
for the event type that occurred is included in the
do_not_propagate_mask, the event is never sent.Figures 8-2a, 8-2b, and 8-2c demonstrate the
propagation of an event through the hierarchy, given three different
event_mask and do_not_propagate attribute settings.ID="FG-1002-08-2a"One possible selection schemeFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.8.02a.gif" ID="GC-1002-8-5"The do_not_propagate_mask is rarely used.  However, here
is one scenario in which setting the do_not_propagate_mask
attribute would be useful.  Consider an application with two windows,
a parent and a child.  The program lets the user draw in the child
by moving the pointer while holding down a pointer button.  However,
like basicwin, the application exits on a ButtonPress
event in the parent window.  Since ButtonPress events are not
selected in the child window, they will be propagated to the parent
and will cause the application to exit.  But a ButtonPress
is necessary because we want the drawing in the child window to occur
only when a button is held.  By setting the do_not_propagate_mask
attribute of the child window to ButtonPressMask, this problem
is solved.ID="FG-1002-08-2b"Another possible selection schemeFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.8.02b.gif" ID="GC-1002-8-6"ID="FG-1002-08-2c"Yet another possible selection schemeFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.8.02c.gif" ID="GC-1002-8-7"Here's an example of where event propagation requires care in
selecting events.
Imagine a program that creates one large window and a small
subwindow.  The large window takes ButtonPress events to
exit, and the small subwindow
draws dots whenever the pointer is moved with a button held down.
If you select ButtonPressMask alone for the parent, and
ButtonMotionMask alone for the child, it does not work!  The
reason is that when the ButtonPress occurs, it propagates to
ID="IX-1002-8-125"device eventsselectingID="IX-1002-8-126"selecting device events
the parent, and initiates a grab of all pointer events.  (This is an
automatic grab, discussed in the next section, not the result of an
XGrabButton() or
XGrabPointer() call).  Since the parent did not select motion
events, no MotionNotify events are received by the program.
The moral of the story is that if a parent (or any ancestor) selects
ButtonPress events, then its children must also
select ButtonPress
events in order for the children to get any other type of pointer
events (including MotionNotify, EnterNotify, LeaveNotify).ID="IX-1002-8-127"eventssendingID="IX-1002-8-128"eventsreceiving
For brevity, we need conventions for describing the distribution
of events.  We'll say that an event is sent to a window when
it is generated in that window either because of device action or
as a side effect to an Xlib routine.  A window receives an
event sent to it only if the window has selected that event type or
if the event type is always selected.  Only when a window receives
an event is it placed on the queue for that client.
Another convention is helpful in describing the selection of events.
We will say that "the window has selected that event type" rather
than the more cumbersome "the program has called XSelectInput(),
specifying the window and the mask that selects that event type."We have described the way device events propagate normally.  But
two other actions can modify this operation:  changing the keyboard
focus window or grabbing the keyboard or pointer.  Not only do these
change the distribution of normal events, they create new events as
side effects.  We'll just introduce these here and return to them
in LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer."ID="IX-1002-8-129"keyboard focus windowID="IX-1002-8-130"windowskeyboard focusID="IX-1002-8-131"eventspropagationID="IX-1002-8-132"propagation of eventsID="S3-1002-8-1"The Keyboard Focus WindowID="IX-1002-8-133"keyboard focus windowID="IX-1002-8-134"focus windowkeyboardThe keyboard focus window affects the distribution of KeyPress
and KeyRelease events.  Normally, the window manager allows
the user to specify which window, if any, should be the keyboard focus.
Only the focus window and its descendants receive keyboard input, and
within them, event propagation occurs normally.  Events occurring outside
the focus window are delivered to the focus window.  By default, the
focus window is the root and keyboard events are normally distributed
to all windows on the screen, since all the windows on a screen are
descendants of the root.ID="IX-1002-8-135"XSetInputFocusID="IX-1002-8-136"revert_to windowID="IX-1002-8-137"windowsrevert_to
The keyboard focus is set to a window with XSetInputFocus().
The focus window must be viewable.  LINKEND="FN-1002-8-2"ID="FN-1002-8-2"For a window to be viewable, it must be mapped and all its
ancestors must be mapped, but it may be obscured.
If it is not viewable or later becomes not viewable, the focus

call, the revert_to window.ID="IX-1002-8-138"XGetInputFocusThe current focus window can be read with XGetInputFocus().ID="IX-1002-8-139"eventsFocusInID="IX-1002-8-140"FocusIn eventID="IX-1002-8-141"FocusOut eventID="IX-1002-8-142"eventsFocusOutFocusOut events are delivered to the old focus window, and
FocusIn events to the window which receives the focus.
Windows in between these two windows in the hierarchy are said to
be virtually crossed and receive focus change events depending on
the relationship and direction of transfer between the origin and
destination windows.  Some or all of the windows between the window
containing the pointer at the time of the focus change and that
window's root can also receive focus change events.  By checking
the detail member of FocusIn and FocusOut
events, a client can tell which of its windows can receive input.
See LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer," for more information about tracking
the keyboard focus.Applications should set the keyboard focus to one of their own windows
only when absolutely necessary, because this will prevent other clients
from receiving keyboard events.  It is permissible for clients to set
the focus window when the mouse enters their top-level window, as long
as they set it back to the root window when the pointer leaves again.
A client might want to do this to send all keyboard input to one of
its subwindows.  See LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication," for more information
about what a client should do regarding the keyboard focus.ID="S3-1002-8-2"Keyboard and Pointer GrabbingID="IX-1002-8-143"XGrabPointerID="IX-1002-8-144"XGrabKeyboardID="IX-1002-8-145"passive grabID="IX-1002-8-146"XGrabButtonID="IX-1002-8-147"eventsFocusInID="IX-1002-8-148"eventsFocusOutID="IX-1002-8-149"FocusIn eventID="IX-1002-8-150"FocusOut eventID="IX-1002-8-151"active grabID="IX-1002-8-152"grabbingID="IX-1002-8-153"pointersgrabbingID="IX-1002-8-154"keyboardgrabbingID="IX-1002-8-155"XGrabKeyThe keyboard and/or the pointer can be grabbed when their input should
not be allowed to be interrupted by other clients.  As the name implies,
grabbing prevents other clients from receiving input and, therefore, can
be antisocial.  It should not be done unless absolutely necessary.
Grabbing the pointer is particularly troublesome, because there is
no event to announce to other clients that this has happened.
See Appendix L, Interclient Communcation Conventions,
of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual (as of the second printing).In general, grabbing is an advanced topic that you do not need to
understand in detail until you find a reason to use it.  But there are
two exceptions to this rule.  You do need to know what will happen when
other clients grab, so that your client can prepare for it.  Secondly,
an automatic grab takes place between ButtonPress and
ButtonRelease events if your client has selected both.  You must
understand grabbing to understand the implications of this automatic grab.An active grab causes pointer and keyboard events to be sent to
the grabbing window regardless of the current position of the pointer.
Active grabs are invoked directly by calling XGrabPointer() and
XGrabKeyboard().  A passive grab (invoked by calling
XGrabKey() or XGrabButton()) causes an active grab to begin
when a certain key or button combination is pressed.  Passive grabs are
useful in implementing menus.When you grab a device, you have the option of confining the pointer
to any window within the grabbing client and of controlling the
further processing of both keyboard and pointer events.ID="IX-1002-8-156"grabbingand eventsID="IX-1002-8-157"eventsselecting;by grabbingID="IX-1002-8-158"selecting eventsby grabbing
Grabbing the keyboard effectively selects all keyboard events, whether
you selected them previously or not.  Grabbing the keyboard also causes
FocusIn and FocusOut events to be sent to the old and
new focus windows, but they must be selected by each window to be received.
In the call to grab the pointer, however, you specify what
types of pointer, button, and enter/leave events you want.Grabs take precedence over the keyboard focus window.  Grabs of the
keyboard generated FocusIn and FocusOut events, so
that if your client selects these, it can determine whether or not
it can get keyboard events.  Pointer grabbing is more problematic,
since no event notifies other clients when one client has grabbed
it.  However, pointer grabs are almost always temporary.For more on keyboard and pointer grabbing, see LINKEND="S1-1002-9-4"Section 9.4, "Grabbing the Keyboard and Pointer."

though still related to events, see LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management."ID="S2-1002-8-10"Event MasksID="IX-1002-8-159"event maskdescription of eachThis section describes the event masks and the events they select.
After reading this section, you should have a good idea of what
types of events exist, what they are for, how to select them, and
when to use them.  LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer," and the sections
listed in Table 8-5 provide practical examples and describe
the use of some of the more commonly used events in more detail.
Appendix E, Event Reference, provides a complete reference to
each event type.ID="S3-1002-8-3"KeyPressMask and KeyReleaseMaskID="IX-1002-8-160"KeyPressMask event maskID="IX-1002-8-161"eventsKeyPressID="IX-1002-8-162"KeyReleaseMask eventID="IX-1002-8-163"eventsKeyReleaseKeyPress and KeyRelease events report when a
keyboard key has been pressed or released.  Most, but not all,
servers are capable of generating KeyRelease events.
Shift, Control, and other modifier keys generate events just
like the main keyboard.The KeyPress and KeyRelease events provide a keycode
that identifies the key, but the keycodes are server-dependent and
should not be used to interpret the event.  Instead you can use
XLookupString() to translate the keycode into a portable symbol
called a keysym, which represents the symbol on the cap of the key,
and into an ASCII character string.  Both the mapping between keycodes
and keysyms and the mapping between keysyms and ASCII strings can be modified.In XLookupString(), the main routine used for interpreting
KeyPress and KeyRelease events, there is a provision
for a special Compose key which is available on some keyboards,
so that multikey sequences, usually used to type characters for
languages other than English, can be entered and translated into
the appropriate keysym.  The Compose key feature, however, is not
implemented in the versions of Xlib provided by MIT.The events selected by KeyPressMask and KeyReleaseMask
are used in the examples in LINKEND="S2-1002-9-1"Section 9.1.1, "Simple Keyboard Input."ID="S3-1002-8-4"ButtonPressMask, ButtonReleaseMask, and OwnerGrabButtonMaskID="IX-1002-8-164" SPAN="START"ButtonPressMask event maskID="IX-1002-8-165" SPAN="START"OwnerGrabButtonMaskID="IX-1002-8-166"pointer buttonID="IX-1002-8-167" SPAN="START"ButtonReleaseMask event maskButtonPress and ButtonRelease events occur when
the pointer buttons are pressed.  There are generally between three
and five buttons on the pointer, and the event structure specifies
not only the button that caused the event but also the current state
of all the pointer buttons and the modifier keys on the keyboard.
The mapping between the bits in the button mask and the physical
buttons can be changed with XSetPointerMapping() and read
ID="IX-1002-8-168"XSetPointerMapping
with XGetPointerMapping() and is global to the server.
ID="IX-1002-8-169"XGetPointerMappingThe pointer is automatically grabbed between the ButtonPress
and ButtonRelease events on behalf of the client for whose
window the ButtonPress was selected.  This way, you always
expect to receive button events in pairs since the release will be
sent to your client regardless of the position of the pointer at
that time.  Only one client can select button events on any one
window at one time, due to the grab that automatically takes place.The OwnerGrabButtonMask does not select any event by itself,
but it controls the distribution of button events to your client
during the automatic grab between the ButtonPress and
ButtonRelease (and during any grab your client might make).
If it is selected, the automatic grab has the same effect as an
XGrabButton() call with the owner_events argument set
to True, so that the ButtonRelease event is sent to
whichever of the client's windows the pointer is in.  If the
ButtonRelease occurs outside the client's windows or if
OwnerGrabButtonMask is not selected, all events will be
sent only to the window where the ButtonPress occurred.
Current wisdom suggests that you should always select
OwnerGrabButtonMask with ButtonPressMask.The events selected by ButtonPressMask and
ButtonReleaseMask are discussed in LINKEND="S2-1002-9-7"Section 9.2.2, "Handling Pointer Button Events"
and demonstrated in Examples 9-9, 16-1, and 16-2.

PointerMotionHintMask, ButtonMotionMask,
Button1MotionMask, Button2MotionMask,
Button3MotionMask, Button4MotionMask, and
Button5MotionMask.  Up to five pointer buttons are
supported, even though most mice have only three buttons and
some have only one.MARK="BULLET"PointerMotionMask selects motion events that occur when
any or none of the pointer buttons are pressed.  Each event
includes the position of the pointer within the event window
and the position relative to the origin of the root window.  All
motion events contain a mask that gives the current status of the
modifier keys and pointer buttons and the current server time.
MotionNotify events occur in large numbers while the
pointer is moving steadily.  Therefore, this mask is selected
alone only by clients that require a complete record of pointer
position, such as painting programs.PointerMotionHintMask is used in concert with other pointer
motion masks to reduce the number of events generated.  By itself,
it does not select any events.  PointerMotionHintMask
specifies that the server should send only one MotionNotify
event when the pointer moves, until a key or button state changes,
the pointer leaves the window, or the client calls XQueryPointer()
or XGetMotionEvents().  The idea is that instead of processing
hundreds of pointer motion events, the client gets only one event
per movement and then queries the pointer position or examines the
motion history buffer (the latter may not exist on some servers) for
the current position.  This approach is suitable for clients that need
the pointer position at particular times but that do not need all the
intermediate positions.  Even though each query for the pointer position
is a round-trip request, the performance of this approach is better than
that of selecting all the events with PointerMotionMask alone, because
of the reduced network traffic.ButtonMotionMask selects any pointer motion events that
occur when at least one button is pressed.Button1MotionMask, Button2MotionMask,
Button3MotionMask, Button4MotionMask, and
Button5MotionMask select pointer motion events that
occur when the specified button is pressed.  If two or more
of these masks are used, events with any combination of the
specified buttons (except both released) will be selected.Handling the events selected by these masks is described
in LINKEND="S2-1002-9-6"Section 9.2.1, "Tracking Pointer Motion" and demonstrated in three examples
in that section.

used to inform a client that the pointer just entered or just left
one of its windows.  If the client receives a LeaveNotify
event in its top-level window, the client will not be receiving any
more key, button, or motion events until it gets an EnterNotify
event, unless it is the keyboard focus window or has grabbed the
keyboard or pointer.An EnterNotify event is also generated when a window is mapped
over the current position of the pointer, and a LeaveNotify is
generated when a window containing the pointer is unmapped.EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events are described and

state when the pointer or keyboard focus enters a window.  The
keyboard state is represented (in the event structure) by 32 bytes
of data called a keyboard vector, with one bit for each
keyboard key.  The number of a bit in the vector for a particular
key is the same as the key's keycode.  This vector is the same as
the vector returned by XQueryKeymap().This event type, if it is selected, always follows immediately after
an EnterNotify or FocusIn event.  It allows a client
to find out which keys were pressed when the pointer or the keyboard
focus entered the window.  Since the state of the modifier keys is
already reported in EnterNotify and FocusIn events,
the KeymapNotify event is only useful for reporting the state
of other keys.KeymapState events are not used in the examples in this
manual, because they are rarely needed.  For more information about

the request would be sent as an event and can be safely ignored.
However, if some client (say, the window manager) has selected
SubstructureRedirectMask for the parent of the window on

events but also describes many other topics related to these two input
devices.  In particular, it discusses X's use of keysyms as portable
symbols for character encoding, keyboard remapping, keyboard and
pointer "grabs," and keyboard and pointer preferences.
Internationalized keyboard input is described in Chapter 11.In LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," we showed you quite thoroughly how to
deal with Expose events.  But all we did with pointer and
keyboard events was to exit the program.  As you can guess, there
can be more to it than that.  This chapter describes and demonstrates
the handling of keyboard and pointer events, describes keyboard and
pointer mapping, and describes how to set keyboard preferences.
Internationalized keyboard input is described in Chapter 11,
Internationalized Text Input, although it depends on many concepts
described in this chapter.ID="S1-1002-9-1"The KeyboardThe keyboard is an area like color, where X clients have to be made
portable across systems with different physical characteristics.  In
the case of the keyboard, these variations are in two areas:  whether
the keyboard provides KeyPress and KeyRelease events or
just KeyPress events, and the symbols on the caps of the keys.Almost all serious workstations provide both KeyPress and
KeyRelease events.  Some personal computers, however, may not.
ID="IX-1002-9-1"KeyPress eventID="IX-1002-9-2"KeyRelease eventID="IX-1002-9-3"eventsKeyPressID="IX-1002-9-4"eventsKeyRelease
Therefore, avoid depending on KeyRelease events if you want
your client to be portable to the lowest classes of machines.The second problem is adjusting for variations in the keys available
on each keyboard and the codes they generate.  We'll start explaining
how this problem is solved by describing the contents of a key event.KeyPress and KeyRelease events are stored in
ID="IX-1002-9-5"XKeyEvent structureID="IX-1002-9-6"structuresXKeyEventXKeyEvent structures, shown in Example 9-1.  Each key
event contains the keycode of the key that was pressed and
state, a mask which indicates which modifier keys and pointer
ID="IX-1002-9-7"statekey event componentID="IX-1002-9-8"key eventsstate member
buttons were being held down just before the event.  A modifier key
is a key like Shift or Control that can modify the meaning of a key event.
In addition to their effect on the processing of other keys, the modifier
keys also generate key events with unique keycodes.ID="EX-1002-9-1"The XKeyEvent structuretypedef struct {
   int type;               /* Of event */

} XKeyEvent;
typedef XKeyEvent XKeyPressedEvent;
typedef XKeyEvent XKeyReleasedEvent;ID="IX-1002-9-9"keycodedefinitionThe keycode member of XKeyEvent is a number
between 8 and 255.  The keycode is the same regardless of whether
a key is pressed or released.  The keycode for each physical key
never changes on a particular server, but the key with the same
symbol on it on different brands of equipment may generate different
keycodes.  For portability reasons and because the keycode by itself
without the state of the modifier keys does not provide enough
information to interpret an event, clients cannot use keycodes by
themselves to determine the meaning of key events.Instead of using the keycode alone, X clients call XLookupString()ID="IX-1002-9-10"XLookupString
to translate the key event into a keysym.  A keysym is a defined
ID="IX-1002-9-11"keysymsdefinition
constant that corresponds to the meaning of a key event.  For example,
the translation of the keycode generated by the "a" key on any system
would be XK_a if no other keys were being held and XK_A
if the Shift key were being held or if Shift Lock was in effect (all
keysyms begin with XK_).  The translation of the keycode
for the Return key (which is labeled Enter or just with an arrow on some
keyboards) would be XK_Return.  The Enter key on the keypad,
if any, would have the keysym XK_KP_Enter.  Example 9-2
shows some keysym definitions.  All keysyms are defined in
<X11/keysymdef.h>.
ID="IX-1002-9-12"include fileskeysymdef.hID="IX-1002-9-13"keysymdef.h include fileID="EX-1002-9-2"Some sample keysym definitions#define XK_BackSpace    0xFF08   /* Back space, back char,... */

#define XK_A            0x041
#define XK_e            0x065XLookupString() also provides an ASCII string that corresponds
to the keysym or NULL if there is no associated string.  By
default, all the keys that have ASCII values will have that value as
their string.  For example, XK_A would have the string "A",
XK_ampersand would have the string "&", and XK_4
would have the string "4". XK_Return, XK_Escape,
and XK_Delete have ASCII values, but they are not printable.
XK_Shift_L (the Shift key on the left side of the keyboard)
would not normally have an associated string.The ASCII value for a particular keysym as returned by
XLookupString() can be changed by the client using
XRebindKeysym(), and it can be a string of any length, not just
a single character.  Even though keysyms like XK_F1 (the F1 key)
have no default ASCII mapping, they can be given strings.  This mapping
would apply only to the client that calls XRebindKeysym().
ID="IX-1002-9-14"XRebindKeysymWith these introductory comments, we'll move right to the examples that
handle keyboard input.  Then we'll return to discuss keysyms in more
detail and the various keyboard mappings and how they can be changed.ID="S2-1002-9-1"Simple Keyboard InputExample 9-3 shows the framework of the code for translating a
keyboard event into both a keysym and an ASCII string.  You will need
the keysym to determine what the keystroke means, and the ASCII string
if the keystroke is a printable character.  If the keystroke is
printable, the program would append the ASCII interpretation of the
key event to the end of the result string (and display it).  If the
keystroke is a modifier key being pressed, the event can normally be
ignored, since the modifier status of events on other keys is already
dealt with by XLookupString().  But XK_Delete or
XK_Backspace would indicate that a character should be removed
from the string.The function keys are not initially mapped to ASCII strings and
can be ignored, but if the client allows the user to map them to
ID="IX-1002-9-15"key eventsmapping to ASCIIID="IX-1002-9-16"mappingto ASCII
an arbitrary string, it should treat them like any other printable
character.You may notice in Example 9-3 that XLookupString()ID="IX-1002-9-17"XComposeStatus typeID="IX-1002-9-18"compose key processing
returns something called an XComposeStatus.  Some keyboards
provide a Compose key, which is used to type characters not found
on the keyboard keys.  Its purpose is to make it possible to type
characters from other languages without disturbing the normal
operation of the keyboard.  As it usually works, you press the
Compose key followed by some other key to generate characters
ID="IX-1002-9-19"foreign language characters
like È.  A table is usually provided which tells you which
keys correspond to each foreign character.  Processing of multikey
sequences using the Compose key is now supported as an input method
through the Release 5 internationalization features.
So the XComposeStatus argument of XLookupString()
is now just a dummy.ID="EX-1002-9-3"Translating a key event to keysym and ASCIIDisplay *display;

you have a routine called get_string that gets an ASCII
string from the user.  It gets the entire string before returning.
But under X, the user might stop typing midway through, pop some
other window on top to check some bit of information, then pop the
original application back on top.  That means you need to handle
exposure in the middle of the input string, which, in turn, means
you need a function that remembers the string's state so that it
can be redrawn in the get_string routine.  You also have
to be prepared in case the keyboard gets remapped by some other
client.  Suddenly your tiny subroutine to get a string now must
be integrated into the event loop.LINKEND="EX-1002-9-4"Example 9-4 is a modification to the basicwin program
described in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," that puts up a pop-up dialog
box.  If the user presses a button in the basicwin window,
the application puts up a dialog box, which the user can type into
until a carriage return is typed.  All the printable characters except
Tab are supported, and Delete or Backspace operate as would be expected.
The code allows the user to type the string while also handling the
other events that might occur.  This is done by placing the code for
popping up the dialog in the branch for ButtonPress events,
placing the code to redraw the dialog string in the branch for
Expose events, and placing the code to process key events
in the branch for KeyPress events.

are constants arranged in groups with consecutive values.  By
looking for any keysym in a given range, you do not need to
specify every keysym you intend to match.Notice that the program uses keysyms to match all the keystrokes
and then does different things depending on whether the keysym is
a normal key, a modifier key, a function key, a delete key, or an
enter key.  If the key is printable, it copies the ASCII values
returned by XLookupString() into the result string.This program does have some weaknesses.  LINKEND="FN-1002-9-1"ID="FN-1002-9-1"We could say we left it this way because it is simpler, and it is,
but that is not why we wrote it this way.  We did not realize the
other way would be better until the program was already done.  We
will leave it as an exercise for you to modify it as described!
One of them is that it redraws the entire string instead of just
the character being changed.  Secondly, using XTextItemID="IX-1002-9-28"XTextItem structure
structures for each character and calling XDrawText() instead
of XDrawString() would support Tab characters and functions
keys mapped to strings.  Since a tab has to be expanded into a
number of spaces before being drawn and function keys may be mapped
to arbitrary strings, it is difficult to properly implement them

between the pressing of a key and its interpretation within a program.
ID="IX-1002-9-31"mappingkeys to keycodes
The first, the mapping between physical keys and keycodes, is
server-dependent and cannot be modified.  A client cannot determine
anything about this first mapping, and it is just a fact that certain
ID="IX-1002-9-32"mappingkeycodes to keysyms
physical keys generate certain keycodes.  The second mapping, keycodes
to keysyms, can be modified by clients but is server-wide, so it usually
is not modified.  The specification of which keycodes are considered
modifiers is also part of the second level of mapping, because it
affects the mapping of keycodes to keysyms.  The third mapping, from
keysyms to strings, is local to a client.  This is the mapping with
ID="IX-1002-9-33"mappingkeysyms to strings
which a client can allow the user to map the function keys to strings
for convenience of typing.We are going to describe the mapping between keysyms and strings
first, because this is the mapping that applications are most
likely to change.  Following that, we'll describe what you need
to know about the keycode-to-keysym mapping and modifier mapping
to write normal applications.  These mappings are normally only
changed by clients run from the user's startup script that do
nothing else, because they change the keyboard mapping for all
applications.After that, Sections 9.1.3.1 and 9.1.3.2 are optional reading.
They describe the background and development of keysyms and how to
write special purpose programs to change the server-wide mapping of
keycodes to keysyms and the modifier mapping.  These techniques are
not needed in normal applications.ID="S3-1002-9-2"Keysyms to StringsID="IX-1002-9-34"keysymsmapping to stringsID="IX-1002-9-35"stringsmapping keysyms toID="IX-1002-9-36"mappingkeysyms to stringsThe default mapping of keysyms to ASCII is defined by the server.
The ASCII representation of the keys on the main keyboard are the
ASCII codes for the single characters on the caps of the keys.
Keysyms that do not have ASCII representations, such as the function
keys, initially have mappings to NULL, but they can sometimes
be mapped to strings, as we'll describe.  However, the modifier keys
on some machines cannot be mapped to strings at all.Any client in which the user is expected to type a large amount of
text should support remapping of the function keys to strings.
XRebindKeysym() is the only function that can change this
ID="IX-1002-9-37"XRebindKeysym
string, the one returned by XLookupString().  The string can
be any length.  This change affects only the client that calls
XRebindKeysym().
ID="IX-1002-9-38"XRebindKeysymLINKEND="EX-1002-9-5"Example 9-5 is a short code sample that demonstrates
how to remap function keys to strings.  It binds the string
"STOP" to Shift-F1 and "ABORT" to CTRL-Shift-F1.  Since
keyboards may have two Shift and two Control keys, one on each
side, the process has to be done for both.  Mapping the function
keys combined with modifiers will not work on all servers.  (On
the Sun sample server, this code results in STOP being generated
when F1 is pressed with any modifiers and ABORT never being
generated.)  However, mapping of unmodified function keys should
work on all servers.ID="EX-1002-9-5"Mapping keys to strings#include <X11/keysym.h>  .

the keysym corresponding to each key event, and each call to
XRebindKeysym() causes XLookupString() to run
somewhat slower.  This problem is exacerbated if you want a
function key (or any other key) to generate the same string
with any combination of modifier keys, since this requires
15 or more calls to XRebindKeysym().ID="S3-1002-9-3"The Modifier KeysID="IX-1002-9-39"modifier keysID="IX-1002-9-40"keysymsmodifiers affectingID="IX-1002-9-41"keys modifierA keysym represents the meaning of a certain combination of a
key and modifier keys such as Shift and Control.  For example,
XK_A represents the letter "a" pressed while the Shift
key is held down or while Shift Lock is on.  As in this example,
the keysym depends on what modifier key is being held.Although Shift is present on all keyboards and Control on most,
the remaining modifier keys are not standardized.  There may be
Meta, Hyper, Super, Left, Right, or Alternate keys.  X, however,
has a fixed set of logical modifiers, listed in the first column
of Table 9-1.  Each of these logical modifier symbols
corresponds to a bit in the state member of the XKeyEvent
structure.  On each keyboard, there is a mapping between the physical
modifier keys and these logical modifiers.  Table 9-1 also shows
the keysyms of the keys that are by default mapped to the logical
modifiers on a Sun-3 system and the corresponding keycodes for that
system.  You can use the xmodmap command without arguments to
find out the default modifier mapping on any system.

This array of keysyms for each keycode is initially defined
by the server.  In most cases, only two keysyms are defined

only one for the rest.ID="S3-1002-9-4"Keycodes to KeysymsID="IX-1002-9-43"keycodeto keysym mappingID="IX-1002-9-44"keysymsmapping from keycodesID="IX-1002-9-45" SPAN="START"mappingkeycodes to keysymsClients can change the mapping of keycodes to keysyms (with
XChangeKeyboardMapping()), but they rarely do because this
ID="IX-1002-9-46"XChangeKeyboardMapping
mapping is global to the server.  This change would affect every
client operating on the server.  Every client would receive a
MappingNotify event (regardless of whether they selected
it or whether they actually use keyboard input) and must then
get a new keysym table from the server with XRefreshKeyboardMapping().
(This table is stored in the Display structure and is used by
XLookupString() and the other routines that return keysyms.)
XRefreshKeyboardMapping() works by erasing the copy of the
keyboard and/or modifier mappings that are present in the Display
structure (the keysyms and modifiermap members).
The next time that an Xlib call is made that requires either of
these mappings, a request is made to the server, the new mappings
are transferred to Xlib, and the pointers in the Display
structure are reset to the new mapping data.  Subsequent calls to
access this data use the Display structure instead of
querying the server.ID="IX-1002-9-47"XRefreshKeyboardMappingID="IX-1002-9-48"keyboardQWERTYID="IX-1002-9-49"DVORAK keyboardID="IX-1002-9-50"keyboardQWERTYID="IX-1002-9-51"keyboardDVORAK
One of few applications that might change the mapping between
keycodes and keysyms would be an application that converted
between QWERTY and DVORAK keyboard layout.  These are the
nicknames for two different layouts for the alphabetic
characters on English language keyboards.  The QWERTY keyboard
in common use was originally designed to be slow enough so that
mechanical typesetting machine operators would not be able to
type fast enough to jam their machines.  The DVORAK keyboard,
on the other hand, was designed to place the most common letters
in the English language under the home row of keys and is much faster.Let's say a user wanted to use the DVORAK layout instead of the
default, which is QWERTY.  This application would not even need
to create a window, but it would change the mapping of keycodes
to keysyms with XChangeKeyboardMapping().  The user could
ID="IX-1002-9-52"XChangeKeyboardMapping
then move the keycaps around on the keyboard or label them somehow.
Except for calling XRefreshKeyboardMapping(), other applications
ID="IX-1002-9-53"XRefreshKeyboardMapping
would operate as usual.  From then on, while the server was running,
all applications would work properly with the DVORAK layout.ID="S2-1002-9-3"Background on KeysymsID="IX-1002-9-54"keysymsbackgroundKeysyms are a concept developed especially for X.  It may help you
to understand them better to read about how they were designed.  But
this is optional reading, and you can skip to LINKEND="S1-1002-9-2"Section 9.2, "The Pointer" if
you do not plan to write programs that change the mapping of keycodes
to keysyms.ID="IX-1002-9-55"keysymdef.h include fileID="IX-1002-9-56"include fileskeysymdef.hID="IX-1002-9-57"keysym.h include fileID="IX-1002-9-58"include fileskeysym.h
The keysyms are defined in two include files, <X11/keysym.h>and <X11/keysymdef.h>.  Together these files define several
sets of keysyms for different languages and purposes.  There are
sets for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and so on, intended to
allow for internationalization of programs.  There are also sets
for publishing and technical purposes, because these fields have
their own "languages."  <X11/keysym.h> defines which character
sets are active, and <X11/keysymdef.h> defines the symbols
in all the sets.  Only <X11/keysym.h> needs to be included
in an application because it includes <X11/keysymdef.h>.By default, the enabled sets of defined keysyms include the ISO
Latin character sets (1-4), a set of Greek characters, and a set
ID="IX-1002-9-59"ISO LatinkeysymsID="IX-1002-9-60"keysymsISO Latin
of miscellaneous symbols common on keyboards (Return, Help, Tab,
and so on).  These are sufficient for making an application work
in any Western language.  Symbols for Katakana, Arabic, Cyrillic,
Technical, Special, Publishing, APL, and Hebrew character sets
are defined in <X11/keysymdef.h> but are not enabled in
<X11/keysym.h> and may not be available on all servers.
This is because some C compilers have a limit to the number of
allowable defined symbols.Many of the keysym sets share keysyms with sets earlier in the
<X11/keysymdef.h> include file.  For example, there is only
one XK_space keysym because a space is common to all
languages.  XK_space is in LATIN1 so that it is always
available.  The LATIN2 and LATIN3 sets are quite short because
they share most of their symbols with the previous sets.ID="S3-1002-9-5"The Design of KeysymsEnglish language keyboards tend to be quite standard in the alphanumeric
keys, but they differ radically in the miscellaneous function keys.
Many function keys are left over from early timesharing days or are
designed for a specific application.  Keyboard layouts from large
manufacturers tend to have lots of keys for every conceivable purpose,
whereas small workstation manufacturers often have keys that are solely
for support of some unique function.There are two ways of thinking about how to define keysyms given such a
situation:  the Engraving approach and the Common approach.The Engraving approach is to create a keysym for every unique key
engraving.  This is effectively taking the union of all key engravings
on all keyboards.  For example, some keyboards label function keys across
the top as F1 through Fn, others label them as PF1 through PFn.
These would be different keys under the Engraving approach.  Likewise,
Lock would differ from Shift Lock, which is different from the up-arrow
symbol that has the effect of changing lower case to upper case.  There
are lots of other aliases such as Del, DEL, Delete, Remove, and so forth.
The Engraving approach makes it easy to decide if a new entry should be
added to the keysym set:  if it does not exactly match an existing one,
then a new one is created.  One estimate is that there would be on the
order of 300 to 500 miscellaneous keysyms using this approach, not
counting foreign translations and variations.The Common approach tries to capture all of the keys present on a number
of common keyboards, folding likely aliases into the same keysym.  For
example, Del, DEL, and Delete are all merged into a single keysym.
Vendors would be expected to augment the keysym set (using the
vendor-specific encoding space) to include all of their unique keys
that were not included in the standard set.  Each vendor decides which
of its keys map into the standard keysyms.  It is more difficult to
implement this approach, since a judgement is required whether a
sufficient set of keyboards implement an engraving to justify making
it a keysym in the standard set and which engravings should be merged
into a single keysym.  Under this scheme, there are an estimated 100
to 150 keysyms for an English language keyboard.While neither scheme is perfect, the Common approach has been
selected because it makes it easier to write a portable application.
Having the Delete functionality merged into a single keysym allows
an application to implement a deletion function and expect reasonable
bindings on a wide set of workstations.  Under the Common approach,
application writers are still free to look for and interpret
vendor-specific keysyms, but because they are in an extended set,
application developers should be more conscious that they are
writing applications in a nonportable fashion.ID="S3-1002-9-6"Conventions for Keysym MeaningID="IX-1002-9-61"keysymsmeaning conventionsFor each keycode, the server defines a list of keysyms, corresponding
to the key pressed while various modifier keys are being held.  There
are conventions for the meanings of the first two keysyms in the list.
The first keysym in the list for a particular key should be construed
as the symbol corresponding to a KeyPress when no modifier
keys are down.  The second keysym in the list, if present, usually
should be construed as the symbol when the Shift or Shift Lock modifier
keys are down.  However, if there is only one keysym for a particular
keycode, if it is alphabetic, and if case distinction is relevant for
it, then the appropriate case should be based on the Shift and Lock
modifiers.  For example, if the single keysym is an uppercase A,
you have to use the state member of XKeyEvent to
determine if the Shift key is held.  XLookupString()
should translate the event into the correct ASCII string anyway.X does not suggest an interpretation of the keysyms beyond the first
two and does not define any spatial geometry of the symbols on the
key by their order in the keysym list.  This is because the list of
modifier keys varies widely between keyboards.  However, when programming,
it should be safe to assume that the third member in the keysym list
would correspond to the key pressed with the next most common modifier
available on the keyboard, which might be Control.For keyboards with both left-side and right-side modifier keys
(for example, Shift keys on each side that generate different
keycodes), the bit in the state member in the event
structure defines the OR of the keys.  If electronically
distinguishable, these keys can have separate keycodes and
up/down events generated and your program can track their
individual states manually.ID="S2-1002-9-4"Changing the Server-wide Keyboard MappingsBoth the keycode-to-keysym mapping and the modifier mapping
affect all clients when they are changed by any client.  That
is why normal applications will not change them.  Special purpose
programs, however, can be written to change these mappings, usually
to be run from a user's startup script.  These sections describe how
to write such programs.  If you do not plan to write one, you can

changes the keyboard mapping for all the applications running on

keysyms and maps the keycode associated with the first keysym to
the second keysym.  In other words, you could use it to map the
F1 key to be Escape and Home to be a Control key on the right side
of the keyboard by typing the following:ID="SC-1002-9-1"$  mapkey F1 Escape Home Control_RUse mapkey with care, because it is easy to disable a server

special purpose application run from the user's startup script.While modifier keys generate KeyPress and KeyRelease
events like other keys, modifier keys are the only keys reported in
the state member of every key, button, motion, or border
crossing event structure.  The state member is a mask that
indicates which logical modifiers were pressed when the event occurred.
Each bit in state is represented by a constant such as
ControlMask.  state is used by XLookupString()
to generate the correct keysym from a key event.  Note that the
state member of events other than key, button, motion, and
border crossing events does not have the meaning described here.ID="IX-1002-9-69"XInsertModifiermapEntryID="IX-1002-9-70"XDeleteModifiermapEntryXInsertModifiermapEntry() and XDeleteModifiermapEntry()
provide the easiest ways by far to add or delete a few keycodes
for a modifier.Using XInsertModifiermapEntry() and XDeleteModifiermapEntry()
is straightforward.  You get the current modifier mapping stored in an
XModifierKeymap structure with a call
to XGetModifierMapping().
ID="IX-1002-9-71"XModifierKeymap structureID="IX-1002-9-72"structuresXModifierKeymap
You specify this structure, a keycode, and one of the eight modifier
symbols as the three arguments to XInsertModifiermapEntry() or
XDeleteModifiermapEntry().  Both routines return a new
XModifierKeymap structure suitable for calling
XSetModifierMapping().  You should add or delete all the keycodes
ID="IX-1002-9-73"XSetModifierMapping
you intend to change before calling XSetModifierMapping().You should not need to understand how the modifiers are stored
to use the procedure described above for adding or deleting
keycodes.XSetModifierMapping() is the routine that actually changes the
mapping.  As such, it is when calling XSetModifierMapping()
that any errors appear, even though they are usually caused by
an invalid XModifierKeymap structure that was set earlier.These are the requirements for the XModifierKeymap structure
specified to XSetModifierMapping():MARK="BULLET"Zero keycodes are ignored.No keycode may appear twice anywhere in the map
(otherwise, a BadValue error is generated).All nonzero keycodes must be in the range specified by
min_keycode and max_keycode in the
Display structure (else a BadValue error).A server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be
changed.  For example, certain keys may not generate up
transitions in hardware or multiple modifier keys may not be
supported.  If a restriction is violated, then the status reply
is MappingFailed, and none of the modifiers are changed.If the new keycodes specified for a modifier differ from those
currently defined and any (current or new) keys for that modifier
are in the down state, then the status reply is MappingBusy,
and none of the modifiers are changed.XSetModifierMapping() generates a MappingNotify
event on a MappingSuccess status.When finished mapping the keyboard, you can free the
XModifierKeymap structures by calling
ID="IX-1002-9-74"XModifierKeymap structureID="IX-1002-9-75"structuresXModifierKeymapXFreeModifiermap().
ID="IX-1002-9-76"XFreeModifiermapID="S2-1002-9-5"Other Keyboard-handling RoutinesSeveral routines in addition to XLookupString() provide
ways to translate key events.  None of these routines are commonly
needed in applications.You might think that XKeysymToString() and XStringToKeysym()ID="IX-1002-9-77"XKeysymToStringID="IX-1002-9-78"XStringToKeysym
describe the mapping between keysyms and strings, but they don't.
XKeysymToString() does not return the same string as is placed
in the buffer argument of XLookupString(), when
XKeysymToString() is given the keysym that XLookupString()
returns.  XKeysymToString() changes the symbol form of a keysym
(XK_Return), which is a number, into a string form of the
symbol ("Return"), and XStringToKeysym() does the reverse.
XKeysymToString()(XK_F1) would return "F1" regardless of what
string is currently mapping to the F1 key.  Only XLookupString()
returns the string mapped to a particular keysym with XRebindKeysym().XKeycodeToKeysym() and XKeysymToKeycode() make the mapping
ID="IX-1002-9-79"XKeycodeToKeysymID="IX-1002-9-80"XKeysymToKeycode
between single keycodes and keysyms more accessible.  (XLookupKeysym()ID="IX-1002-9-81"XLookupKeysym
actually takes a key event, extracts the keycode, and calls XKeycodeToKeysym().)
For XKeycodeToKeysym() and XLookupKeysym(), you must specify
which keysym you want from the list for the keycode, with the index
argument.  Remember that the list of keysyms for each keycode represents
the key with various combinations of modifier keys pressed.  The meaning
of the keysym list beyond the first two (unmodified, Shift or Shift Lock)
is not defined.  Therefore, the index values of 0 and 1 are the
most commonly used.ID="S1-1002-9-2"The PointerID="IX-1002-9-82"pointershandling events fromThe pointer generates events as it moves, as it crosses window
borders, and as its buttons are pressed.  It provides position
information that can define a path in the two-dimensional space
of the screen, tell you which window the pointer is in and allow
the user to "point and click," generating input without using the
keyboard.  In fact, the pointer is the most unique feature of a
window system.This section describes how to track the pointer and how to handle
the pointer buttons.  Border crossing events are discussed
in LINKEND="S1-1002-9-3"Section 9.3, "Border Crossing and Keyboard Focus Change Events," because they must be handled in concert
with keyboard focus change events.ID="S2-1002-9-6"Tracking Pointer MotionID="IX-1002-9-83"pointerstrackingID="IX-1002-9-84"tracking the pointerThere are three ways of handling pointer motion events:MARK="BULLET"Getting all motion events.  The program simply receives and processes
every motion event.  This option is suitable for applications that
require all movements to be reported, no matter how small.  Since
many motion events are generated and reporting the processing of
the events may lag behind the pointer, this approach is not suitable
for applications that require the most current information about
pointer position.ID="IX-1002-9-85"XQueryPointerGetting hints and querying pointer position.  This method greatly
reduces the number of motion events sent but requires that
XQueryPointer() be called to get the current pointer position.
This option is suitable for applications that require only the final
position of the mouse after each movement.ID="IX-1002-9-86"XGetMotionEventsReading the motion history buffer.  After checking that the buffer
exists, call XGetMotionEvents() when you want the array of events
occurring between two specified times.  This option is not available
on all servers, but it is suitable for detailed pointer position
reporting.  Its advantage over getting all motion events is that
the list of pointer positions in the motion history buffer can be
used for undoing or responding to exposure events in drawing applications.Let's look at each of these methods in detail.ID="S3-1002-9-9"Getting All Motion EventsID="IX-1002-9-87"motion eventsgetting allID="IX-1002-9-88"MotionNotify eventgetting allThe most obvious way to handle motion events is to get all motion
events.  The only complication is that you must keep the processing
of each event to a minimum so that the feedback loop to the user is
reasonably fast.LINKEND="EX-1002-9-7"Example 9-7 shows another modification to basicwin,
the program described in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."  It creates
a child window of the top-level window of the application and
allows the user to draw into it by moving the pointer with any

}The program keeps a record of the points drawn so that they
can be redrawn in case of an Expose event.  The event
record is a ring buffer so that the latest BUF_SIZE
pointer positions are always maintained.The program requires that one or more of the pointer buttons
must be held down while drawing.  (Most drawing applications
require a button to be held, because otherwise it is impossible
to move the pointer into a different application without drawing
a trail of points to the edge of the window.)  Therefore, drawing
applications normally select ButtonMotionMask.It would be quite easy to extend this program by giving each button
a different meaning.  Drawing with button 1 could mean drawing in
black, button 2 could mean drawing in white, and button 3 could mean
toggling the previous state of the drawn pixels.  The only change
necessary to implement this would be code that changes the foreground
pixel value and logical operation in a GC or creates three GCs with
these variations.  The routine would determine which button was pressed
from the state member of the event structure and determine what
to do if more than one button was pressed.ID="S3-1002-9-10"Using Pointer Motion HintsID="IX-1002-9-89"pointersmotion hintsID="IX-1002-9-90"hintspointer motionIf you do not need a record of every point the pointer has passed through
but only its current position, using motion hints is the most efficient
method of handling pointer motion events.  This method could be used for
dragging in menus or scrollbars, in a window manager when it moves the
outlines of windows, or in a drawing application in a line drawing mode.
We'll demonstrate the technique in a line drawing application.ID="IX-1002-9-91"PointerMotionHintMaskID="IX-1002-9-92"masksPointerMotionHintMask
To use this method, select PointerMotionHintMask in addition to
the specific event masks you desire.  PointerMotionHintMask is
a modifier; it does not select events by itself.LINKEND="EX-1002-9-8"Example 9-8 demonstrates how to read pointer events with
PointerMotionHintMask selected.  The code shown in the
example draws lines between the series of points the user specifies
with button clicks.  The ButtonPress event indicates the

}In some applications, you do not need to track pointer motion
events to know where the pointer is at particular times.  The
pointer position is given in ButtonPress, ButtonRelease,
KeyPress, KeyRelease, EnterNotify, and
LeaveNotify events.  You can use any of these events
to locate objects in a window.ID="S3-1002-9-11"Motion HistoryID="IX-1002-9-95"motion history buffergetting motion eventsID="IX-1002-9-96"XTimeCoord structureID="IX-1002-9-97"XGetMotionEventsIf the motion history buffer exists on the server
(XDisplayMotionBufferSize() (display) > 0), all selected
motion events are placed in a list of XTimeCoord structures.
There is no macro for accessing this member of the display
structure.  You specify the desired range of times to
XGetMotionEvents(), and it returns a pointer to a list
of XTimeCoord structures, representing all the pointer
ID="IX-1002-9-98"XTimeCoord structure
positions during the range of times.  The reported pointer
positions may be in finer detail than would be reported by
MotionNotify events.In the MIT sample distribution of Xlib, motion history buffers were
first implemented in Release 5.  In any case, they are not
a required part of a server implementation.  Therefore,
an application that uses motion history should

}ID="S2-1002-9-7"Handling Pointer Button EventsID="IX-1002-9-101"pointer buttoneventsThe examples of tracking pointer motion in LINKEND="S2-1002-9-6"Section 9.2.1, "Tracking Pointer Motion" use
the buttons to some extent, but they do not tell you the whole
story.  There is the subject of automatic button grabs, and
there are issues involved in making each button perform a
different function.  Let's tackle grabs first.
ID="IX-1002-9-102"grabbingpointersID="IX-1002-9-103"pointersgrabbingWhen a pointer button is pressed, an active grab is triggered
ID="IX-1002-9-104"active grab
automatically (as described in LINKEND="S3-1002-8-2"Section 8.3.2.2, "Keyboard and Pointer Grabbing," an active grab
means that all button events before the matching ButtonRelease
event on the same button always goes to the same application, or
sometimes the same window, as the ButtonPress).  The
automatic grab does not take place if an active grab already exists
or a passive grab on the present key and button combination exists
for some higher level window in the hierarchy than the window in
which the ButtonPress occurred.The OwnerGrabButtonMask that you can specify in calls
to XSelectInput() controls the distribution of the
ButtonRelease event (and any other pointer events that
occur between the ButtonPress and ButtonRelease).
If OwnerGrabButtonMask is selected, the ButtonReleaseID="IX-1002-9-105"OwnerGrabButtonMask
event will be sent to whichever window in the application the pointer
is in when the event occurs.  If the pointer is outside the application
or if OwnerGrabButtonMask is not selected, the event is sent
to the window in which the ButtonPress occurred.OwnerGrabButtonMask should be selected when an application
wants to know in which window ButtonRelease events occur.  This
information is useful when you require that both the ButtonPress
and the matching ButtonRelease events occur in the same window
in order for an operation to be executed.  In practice, it does not hurt
to select OwnerGrabButtonMask even if you do not need the response
it provides.  If you do not select OwnerGrabButtonMask, any changes
you try to make to the event mask of the grabbing window before the
ButtonRelease will not take effect.The automatic grabs affect only the window to which button
events are sent.  To be more precise, they affect the value of
the window member in the button event structures in the
application's event queue.  And for the event to be placed on the
queue in the first place, it must have been selected on the window
specified in the window member.Now let's talk about distinguishing which pointer button was
pressed.  Two members of the XButtonEvent structure contain
information about the button state.  The button member
specifies the button that changed state to trigger the event.  The
state member gives the state of all the buttons and modifier
keys just before the event.  You will need the state member only if
you require that certain key or button combinations be pressed to
trigger an operation.Especially if you require that the same button must be pressed and
released in a certain window, be sure to account for the case where,
for example, button 1 is pressed, then buttons 2 and 3 are pressed
and released (perhaps repeatedly) or pressed and held, before
button 1 is again released.  You must be careful if you structure
your code as shown in LINKEND="EX-1002-09-11"Example 9-11
to handle ButtonPress
and ButtonRelease events in pairs.  LINKEND="FN-1002-9-2"ID="FN-1002-9-2"This code is an excerpt from winman, the simple window
manager described in LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management."
There is no case for ButtonRelease in the example.  Instead the
code for ButtonPress looks for the matching ButtonRelease

between the physical pointer buttons and the logical buttons
that are reported when a button is pressed.  In other words,
if physical button 1 were mapped to logical button 3, then
when either button 3 or button 1 were pressed, it would appear
to all applications that only button 3 was pressed.ID="IX-1002-9-108"logical pointer buttonsThere are five logical buttons, but the number of physical buttons
may range from one up to and perhaps greater than five.  Mapping the
pointer buttons might be done, for example, to simulate buttons 4
and 5 on a system with a three-button mouse.  However, while physical
buttons 1 and 2 were mapped to logical 4 and 5, no buttons would be
mapped to logical 1 and 2.  Therefore, there would have to be a way
of toggling between the modes, perhaps using a function key.The mapping of pointer buttons is analogous to the mapping between
keycodes and keysyms in that it is global to the server and affects
all clients.  However, since the translation of a pointer event takes
place in the server, unlike key event processing routines that use
information stored in Xlib whenever possible, no routine is necessary
to update the pointer mapping like XRefreshKeyboardMapping()
updates the keyboard mapping.ID="IX-1002-9-109"XGetPointerMappingXGetPointerMapping() returns the current mapping between physical
and logical pointer buttons.  XSetPointerMapping() sets this mapping.

when the pointer crosses a window border.  If the window manager
is of the real-estate-driven variety (as is uwm), you might
be tempted to assume that a LeaveNotify event indicates
that the window will not receive keyboard input until it receives
a matching EnterNotify.  However, this assumption is not
true if the user has been allowed to set a keyboard focus window.
It is also not true if the window manager is of the listener
variety (see Chapters 1, Introduction, 12, Interclient Communication, and 16, Window Management).  Ideally,
you should be prepared to deal with either type of window manager.Pointer input can only be delivered to a window when the pointer is
inside the window (unless the window grabs the pointer).  Therefore,
an application that depends on pointer input can expect to be idle
when the pointer leaves the window and to be active again when the
pointer enters.  Notice that keyboard input can be diverted with the
keyboard focus or grabs, while pointer input can only be diverted by grabs.FocusIn and FocusOut events occur when the keyboard
focus window changes (when some client calls XSetInputFocus()).
By using focus events together with the border crossing events, an
application should be able to determine whether or not it can get
keyboard input.  If it cannot get keyboard input, it may change its
behavior somewhat.  If it polls for keyboard input to allow for interrupts,
it can stop polling.  If it normally highlights a window when the pointer
enters it, it should not do so if the keyboard focus is not the root window.In general, to determine if it will get keyboard input, an application
should first check FocusIn and FocusOut events.  If
the focus window is the root window, then the application should check
LeaveNotify and EnterNotify to see if keyboard events
are possible.Additional focus change and border crossing events are generated
when the origin and destination of the focus or pointer crossing
do not have a parent-child relationship.  These events are called
virtual crossing events.  See Appendix E, Event Reference,
for a description of when these events are generated and how to
distinguish them from normal crossing events.LINKEND="EX-1002-09-12"Example 9-12 shows the code that would be used to monitor

highlights a portion of an application when it can get
keyboard input.  It would be in active mode when
the keyboard_active flag is True.  When
an EnterNotify event is received, the focus
member of the event structure is checked to see that the
focus window is an ancestor of the window in question.
If so, keyboard_active is True.  When a
LeaveNotify event is received, keyboard_active
is True only if the application has the focus.  On
FocusIn events, keyboard_active is True,
and a flag (focus) is set to indicate whether the
keyboard will be active after LeaveNotify events.ID="S2-1002-9-10"The KeymapNotify EventThe KeymapNotify event, when selected, always follows on

the queue immediately after a FocusIn or EnterNotify
event.  Its purpose is to allow the application to easily determine
which combination of keys were pressed when the focus was transferred
to the window or the pointer entered it.  The KeymapNotify
event contains a keyboard vector, which is a 32-element array
of type char, in which each bit represents a key.  For a
given key, its keycode is its position in the keyboard vector.The XQueryKeymap() function also returns this keyboard vector.
ID="IX-1002-9-130"XQueryKeymap
Keyboard vectors are always independent of all the keyboard mapping
and reading functions, since the bits in the vector correspond to
keycodes that cannot be changed.  This way of reading the keyboard
is just like reading the pointer buttons.  It can be useful for
applications that treat the keyboard not as characters but, for
example, as piano keys or drum pads.Since XQueryKeymap() makes a routine trip request, reading
the keyboard this way could not achieve the same performance
when operating over a network as the same program implemented
using events.ID="S1-1002-9-4"Grabbing the Keyboard and PointerID="IX-1002-9-131" SPAN="START"grabbingkeyboardsID="IX-1002-9-132" SPAN="START"grabbingpointersID="IX-1002-9-133"XGrabKeyboardID="IX-1002-9-134"XGrabPointerID="IX-1002-9-135"XGrabKeyID="IX-1002-9-136"XGrabButtonID="IX-1002-9-137"XChangeActivePointerGrabThere are times when a program might want to bypass the normal
keyboard or pointer event propagation path in order to get input
independent of the position of the pointer.  This is the purpose of
grabbing the keyboard and pointer.  There are routines to grab the
keyboard (XGrabKeyboard()) or the pointer (XGrabPointer()),
or to arrange that they become grabbed when a certain combination of
keys and/or buttons is pressed (XGrabButton(), XGrabKey()).
There are corresponding calls to ungrab (XUngrabButton(),
XUngrabKey(), XUngrabKeyboard(), XUngrabPointer()),
and there is one call to change the characteristics of a pointer grab
(XChangeActivePointerGrab()).One of the most common situations where grabbing takes place is with
button events.  Most applications want both a ButtonPress and
a ButtonRelease, so that they can compare the two positions.
Since this is such a common desire, the server automaticallyID="IX-1002-9-138"automatic grabbetween button eventsID="IX-1002-9-139"buttongrab between

if both are selected, so that you do not have to make an explicit grab.One reason for grabbing a device is so that you can handle a
series of events contiguously without fear of intervening events.
But when you grab a device, no other application can receive
input from that device.  Therefore, it is something to do only
when absolutely necessary.The routines that grab take several arguments that tailor the
input response in these ways:MARK="BULLET"When the pointer is grabbed, the cursor may be confined to
any window (the confine_to argument).ID="IX-1002-9-144"owner_eventsin grabbingID="IX-1002-9-145"grabbingowner_events
The distribution of events to windows within the application
can be modified by the owner_events argument.  If
owner_events is True, then the grabbed events
will be sent to the window within the application that the
pointer indicates.  If owner_events is False
or the pointer is outside the applications, then the events
are always sent only to window specified by window.ID="IX-1002-9-146"grab_windowID="IX-1002-9-147"windowsgrab
A window called the grab_window is specified.  All events
that occur outside the calling application's windows are reported
to the grab window.  All events within the application's windows
will be sent to the grab window if the owner_events
argument is False, or they will be reported normally
within the application (to the window indicated by the pointer
or propagating from that window if it did not select the event)
if owner_events is True.For events that occur outside the calling application's windows,
and events that occur inside when owner_events is
False, the event_mask argument specifies
which types of events are selected for the grab window.  This
event_mask overrules the existing event_mask
for the grab window unless owner_events is True.ID="IX-1002-9-148"XAllowEventsEvent processing for either keyboard or pointer events or both
may be halted altogether during the grab until a releasing
XAllowEvents() call is invoked by setting the
pointer_mode or keyboard_mode arguments
to GrabModeSync.ID="IX-1002-9-149"cursorgrabbingThe cursor argument specifies a particular Cursor
to be displayed while the grab is active.  This cursor indicates
to the user that input is going to the grabbing window, since the
cursor will not change when moved across the screen as it normally would.Grabbing calls may specify a time when the grab should take place
(the time argument).You can change several of the conditions of an active pointer grab,
namely the event_mask, cursor, and time,
using XChangeActivePointerGrab().

take place when a certain combination of keys or buttons is pressed.
After one of these routines is called, a passive grab is said to be
in effect, until the specified keys and buttons are pressed.  At that
time, the grab is active and is indistinguishable from a grab generated
by a call to XGrabKeyboard() or XGrabPointer().  After a
passive grab, an active pointer grab will take effect when the following
four conditions are met:MARK="BULLET"The specified button is pressed when an optional set of modifier
keyboard keys is pressed and no other keys or buttons are pressed.The pointer is contained in the grab window specified in the grabbing call.ID="IX-1002-9-154"XGrabPointerID="IX-1002-9-155"XGrabButton
The cursor-confining window (specified in the confine_to argument
of XGrabPointer() or XGrabButton()) must be visible, if one
is specified.These conditions are not satisfied by any ancestor.Grabbing the keyboard is similar to setting the keyboard focus window,
but grabbing is more flexible, since there are more arguments to modify
the effect.  Focus changes and keyboard grabs and ungrabs all generate
the same FocusIn and FocusOut events.

frozen, and the server again queues any events that occur on that

In effect, XAllowEvents() allows events to come in a batch
through the network to the event queues for each application in Xlib.The pointer modes have no effect on the processing of keyboard events
and vice versa.ID="IX-1002-9-169"pointersgrabbingID="IX-1002-9-170"keyboardgrabbing
Both a pointer grab and a keyboard grab may be active at the same
time by the same or different clients.  If a device is frozen on
behalf of either grab, no event processing is performed for the
device.  It is possible for a single device to be frozen by both
grabs.  In this case, the freeze must be released on behalf of
both grabs before events can again be processed.

keyboard input is sent, is controlled by the window manager.
However, the window manager only gives the keyboard input focus
to top-level windows.  So essentially the window manager gives the
keyboard focus to one application at a time.Order entry applications need to move the keyboard focus from subwindow
to subwindow within the application.  Many of them
interpret the Tab key as a command to move to the next information
entry field.  To do this reliably while allowing type-ahead, they
must use the keyboard focus in combination with grabs.
Here's why, as written by Wayne Dyksen of Purdue University.LINKEND="FN-1002-9-3"
It begins with a little more about synchronous and asynchronous grabs,
which you need to understand to follow the rest.
ID="FN-1002-9-3"This is an excerpt of the paper
"Controlling Event Delivery with Grabs and Keyboard Focus,"by Wayne Dyksen, that appeared in The X Resource, Issue 2.As "raw" events occur on devices,
the Server processes them and sends them to clients.
For example, given a raw event, the Server must
determine to which window the event is to be sent;
that is, the Server must determine the value of the
window member of the event structure.  The parameters
pointer_mode and keyboard_mode
arguments of XGrabButton(), XGrabPointer(),
XGrabKey(), and XGrabKeyboard()
control the processing of raw events during a grab;
they can have either of the values GrabModeAsync or
GrabModeSync.If the value GrabModeAsync
is used, then event processing for the grabbed device is
asynchronous, as usual.  That is, the Server processes and sends all
grabbed events to the grabbing client as soon as they occur.
Note that all ungrabbed events (e.g., Expose)
are processed and sent normally.If GrabModeSync is used, then, when the grab occurs,
the Server records raw device events in an internal queue,
but it temporarily stops processing and sending them to the grabbing
client.  The Server resumes raw event processing when the grabbing
client sends either an XAllowEvents() request or an ungrab
request.Using GrabModeSync
is often referred to as freezing the keyboard or pointer.
This term is the source of some confusion since using
GrabModeSync
does not freeze (lockup) the pointer or keyboard themselves
in any intuitive sense.
One would guess that if the pointer or keyboard were "frozen,"then using them would have no effect.
In fact, use of the pointer and keyboard during a freeze continues to
generate raw events which are recorded (but not processed or sent) by
the Server.  For example, the pointer cursor continues to move on the
screen.  Using GrabModeSync
does not freeze the physical pointer or keyboard themselves, but
rather it freezes the raw pointer or keyboard events at the
Server.  The raw events (not the devices) are eventually thawed
(processed and sent) when the freezing client sends either an
XAllowEvents() request or an ungrab request.Consider the simplified forms fill-in application illustrated in
LINKEND="FG-1002-9-1"Figure 9-1.
Recall that the user gets from one blank to the next
(from one window to the next)
by using a special key (say Next).
Each blank in the form
is implemented by a separate X window.
The client changes the keyboard input focus (via
XSetInputFocus())
to the next blank (window) each time it receives a Next
KeyPress event.ID="FG-1002-9-1"Simplified forms fill-in applicationFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.9.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-9-2"Suppose first that a client were to attempt to implement this forms
fill-in application by having the "form" window (the parent of the
blanks) asynchronously grab the Next key.  When the form window
receives a Next KeyPress event, it issues an
XSetInputFocus()
request, changing the keyboard input focus to the next blank.Consider the possible scenario of events
when a user types "D-y-k-s-e-n-Next-W-a-y-n-e,"as illustrated in
LINKEND="FG-1002-9-2"Figure 9-2.
Each Snapshot shows the events and requests in queues at
a moment in time; events as they are first generated ("Raw Events"),
events as the server determines the window to which they should be
delivered ("Cooked Events"), and requests made by the client in
response to the arrival of these events.
"Raw Events" are physical device events which the Server has queued
and must process; for example, "s --> ?" indicates that the "s"key has been pressed and that the Server must decide to which window
the KeyPress event is to be sent.
"Cooked Events" are events which the Server has processed and is
about to dispatch; for example, "D --> Last" indicates that the
"D" key has been pressed and that the event is to be sent to the
"Last Name" window.
"Requests" are requests which have come from the client in response
to events; for example, "D --> Last" indicates that the client
has requested the Server to draw a "D" in the "Last Name" window.ID="FG-1002-9-2"Possible scenario of events using an asynchronous key grabFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.9.02.gif" ID="GC-1002-9-3"Consider now what might happen if a user were to type
"D-y-k-s-e-n-Next-W-a-y-n-e."When the event "Next --> Form" illustrated in Snapshot 2 is received
by the "Form" window,
the client issues the request "Focus --> First" shown in Snapshot 3.
Unfortunately, while the client is processing the Next
KeyPress
event, the Server is asynchronously processing further keyboard events.
Thus, until the Server actually receives and processes the
"Focus --> First" request, it continues to dispatch
KeyPress
events to the "Last Name" window.
This is illustrated in Snapshot 3 where the Server is dispatching
"W-a-y" to the "Last Name" window.
Since the events "W-a-y" are sent to the "Last Name" window, the client
issues the requests shown in Snapshot 4 to draw "W-a-y" in the "Last Name"window.
Eventually, the Server does receive and process the "Focus --> First"request.  Snapshot 4 and 5 show "n-e" being sent to and drawn in
the "First Name" window.  The above scenario produces the incorrect
result illustrated in
LINKEND="FG-1002-9-3"Figure 9-3.ID="FG-1002-9-3"Possible incorrect forms fill-in result using an asynchronous key grabFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.9.03.gif" ID="GC-1002-9-4"Note that the actual forms fill-in result using an asynchronous grab
varies depending on the time between KeyPress events.
In fact, the form would produce the correct result if a user were
to type "D-y-k-s-e-n-Next" followed by a sufficiently long pause followed
by "W-a-y-n-e."Consider again the above example, only this time suppose that the
client synchronously grabs the Next key (before any key
events are processed).
The sequence of events that occur in response to the user typing
"D-y-k-s-e-n-Next-W-a-y-n-e" is illustrated in
LINKEND="FG-1002-9-4"Figure 9-4.ID="FG-1002-9-4"Scenario of events using a synchronous key grabFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.9.04.gif" ID="GC-1002-9-5"As soon as the Server sees the raw Next KeyPress
event, it initiates a synchronous grab.
Snapshot 3 shows that the Server is continuing to record raw
KeyPress events, but it has stopped "cooking" them.
The KeyPress events "W-a-y-n-e" have accumulated in the
Server's "Raw Events" queue.  After receiving the Next
KeyPress event,
the client sends a request to the Server to change the focus
to the "First Name" window ("Focus --> First")
followed by a request to start cooking events ("Allow Events").

the wrist, you can also move quickly to the far reaches of the screen.XChangePointerControl() takes three arguments (in addition
to the ubiquitous display):  accel_numerator,
accel_denominator, and threshold.The accel_numerator and accel_denominator
arguments make up a fraction that determines the multiple used
to determine how many pixels to move the cursor based on how
much the physical pointer moved.  The threshold argument
specifies how many pixels the physical pointer must have moved
for acceleration to take effect.ID="S1-1002-9-7"X Input ExtensionAs of Release 5, the X Input extension is now a standard

applications, including sales to foreign markets and
simple courtesy to users who would prefer to run those
applications in different languages.
Because internationalization involves some
confusing concepts, the topic is divided into two chapters.
If there is any chance, however, that you
will someday have to port your applications to run in a
different country or language, you should at least be
familiar with the concepts and techniques introduced in
these chapters.  If you know what is involved in
internationalization, you can avoid writing
applications that will be difficult to internationalize
later on.ID="IX-1002-10-2"internationalizationprogramsAn internationalized application is one that runs, without
changes to the binary, in any given "locale."  Among
other things, this means that a program must display
all text in the user's language, accept input of all
text in that same language, and display times, dates,
and numbers in the user's accustomed format.The internationalization of terminal-based programs is
a problem that has been
satisfactorily solved where terminals exist that can
display and accept input for a particular language.
The ANSI-C library contains mechanisms for this terminal-based
internationalization, and R5
internationalization is based on these
mechanisms.  This chapter begins
with a detailed overview of the goals, concepts, and
techniques of internationalization, starting with
ANSI-C internationalization and progressing to the
new R5 internationalization features.  After the
overview, each section covers an individual topic in
X internationalization.  Internationalized text input
with R5 is a large subject and is given
its own chapter following this one.Internationalization is implemented
with a separate set of functions for handling keyboard input and
drawing text, that are new in Release 5.  All the input and drawing
techniques shown in previous chapters continue to work, but they do
not support internationalization.  So it is up to you which set of
functions to use depending on your needs.Also note that the internationalization
features of R5 are not self contained, and therefore
may not work on all systems.  If you do not have the
ANSI-C internationalization features, you may be
able to make do with alternatives provided by Xlib and by
contributed libraries, but these have not been
thoroughly tested and you may encounter
difficulties.  In ANSI-C internationalization,
the C library reads a "localization
database" customized for each
locale.  Many systems (systems sold in the U.S., at least)
support ANSI-C internationalization, but do not
ship databases for any but a default locale.LINKEND="FN-1002-10-1"ID="FN-1002-10-1"If you have a system like this and are building X from the
MIT distribution, and would like to
experiment with X internationalization, add
-DX_LOCALE to the StandardDefines
definition in the .cf file for your system (in
the directory mit/config/) before you build the
release.  This variable should allow X
internationalization to work without the ANSI-C
locale databases.  It will not, of course,
make ANSI-C internationalization itself work.
If your system does not have any of the ANSI-C
internationalization support, and in particular does
not define the type wchar_t (a "wide character"used for text in some locales), you will also need to add
-DX_WCHAR to the StandardDefines
variable.  Finally, your programs should include the
file <X11/Xlocale.h> instead of the standard
<locale.h> and be compiled with
-DX_LOCALE; this will replace the ANSI-C
setlocale with an X version of the function.One more warning and disclaimer is required.  These internationalization
features are new in Release 5, and therefore there is no experience
in their use.  So the coverage in this book probably does not yet
answer every question you might have, nor present a foolproof
procedure for writing an internationalized application.  We hope
to add more practical instructions once we know better what to tell
you.ID="IX-1002-10-3"i18ninternationalizationA final point of terminology:  the word "internationalization"contains 20 letters.  In the MIT X documentation and elsewhere, you
may find it abbreviated as i18n--the letter "i" followed by 18
letters and the letter "n."ID="S1-1002-10-1"An Overview of InternationalizationID="IX-1002-10-4"internationalizationoverviewIf you are a native English speaker, particularly an
American, you may never have thought much about what is
required for the internationalization of programs for
the simple reason that all the programs you use already
speak your language. There are four general areas
that require attention when writing an
internationalized application:MARK="BULLET"An internationalized application must display all text
in the user's native or preferred language.  This
includes prompts, error messages, and text displayed by
buttons, menus, and other widgets.  The obvious approach
to this sort of internationalization is to remove all
strings that will be displayed from the source code of
the application and put them instead in a file that
will be read in when the application starts up.  Then
it is a relatively simple matter to translate the file
of strings to other languages and have the application
read the appropriate one at startup.
Many X applications that use the X resource
manager to provide an app-defaults file are already
internationalized in this way, though some still have
non-internationalized error messages.  Another approach
to the internationalization of strings is the message
catalog facility defined by the X/Open Portability
Guide, Issue 3 (often known as XPG3).  LINKEND="FN-1002-10-2"ID="IX-1002-10-5"X/Open Portability GuideIssue 3ID="IX-1002-10-6"XPG3ID="IX-1002-10-7"internationalizationof stringsID="IX-1002-10-8"stringsinternationalizedID="FN-1002-10-2"X/Open is an influential international group working to
encourage computer inter-operability.  It is not
related to the X Consortium or the X Window System.
The three functions catopen, catgets,
and catclose, provide a simple mechanism for
retrieving numbered strings from a plain text file.
These functions are available on some systems, but are
not part of any formal standard, and are not
universally available.ID="IX-1002-10-9"timedisplaying in internationalized applicationsID="IX-1002-10-10"datesdisplaying in internationalized applications
An internationalized application must display times,
dates, numbers, etc. in the format that the user is
accustomed to.  Where an American user sees a date
in the form month/day/year, an
English user should see
day/month/year, and a German user
should see day.month.year.  And where
an American user sees the number 1,234.56, a French
user should see 1.234,56.  The definition of
"alphabetical order" is a similar customary usage that
varies from country to country.  In Spain, for example,
the string "ch" is treated as a single letter that
comes after "c."  So while the strings "Chile" and
"Colombia" are in alphabetical order for an American
user, they are out of order for a Spanish user.  These
ID="IX-1002-10-11"setlocale
and related problems of local customs are resolved with
the ANSI-C setlocale mechanism.  Calling this
function causes the ANSI-C library to read a
database of localization information.  Other functions
in the C library (such as printf for displaying
numbers and strcoll for comparing strings) use
the information in this database
so that they can behave correctly in the current
locale.  The R5 internationalization mechanisms
are built upon this setlocale mechanism.  It is
described in more detail in the next section.An internationalized program must be capable of
displaying all the characters used in the user's
language, and must allow the user to generate all these
characters as input.  For terminal-based applications,
this can be thought of as a hardware issue:  a French
user's terminal must be capable of displaying the
ID="IX-1002-10-12"accented charactersdisplayingID="IX-1002-10-13"charactersaccented, displaying
accented characters used in French, and there must be
some way to generate those characters from the
keyboard.  With X and bit-mapped displays, character
display is not a problem--simply a matter of finding
the required font or fonts.  For languages like
Chinese, fonts with many characters are required, but X
supports 16-bit fonts, which is large enough for almost
all languages.

Keyboard input for Chinese and other ideographic Asian
languages is another matter, however.  When there are
more characters in a language than there are
keys on a keyboard,
some sort of "input method" is required for
converting multiple keystrokes into a single character.
Ideographic languages require complex input methods,
and often there is more than one standard method for a
language.  An internationalized application must
support any input method chosen by the user.  R5
provides this capability; it is described in LINKEND="CH-1002-10-1"Chapter 10, "Internationalization."An internationalized program must operate regardless of
the encoding of characters in the user's language.  A
program (or operating system) that ignores or truncates
the eightth bit of every character won't work in Europe,
because the accented characters used in many European
languages are represented with numbers greater than 127.
An application that assumes that every character is 8
bits long won't work in Japan where there are many
thousands of ideographic characters.  Furthermore,
common Japanese usage intermixes 16-bit Japanese
characters with 8-bit Latin
characters, so it is not even safe to assume that
characters are of a uniform width.
When internationalizing an application, two areas of
particular difficulty are string manipulation (how, for
example, can you iterate through the characters of a
string when those characters have differing widths)
and text input and output.  (How, for example, do you display a
Japanese string that contains characters
from different fonts?)One approach to the encoding
problem is to side-step it by defining a universal
ID="IX-1002-10-19"Latin-1ID="IX-1002-10-20"encodingsLatin-1
encoding used everywhere.  The Latin-1 encoding is
suitable for English and most western European
languages, and this shared encoding dramatically
simplifies the problem of porting applications to work
in many European countries.  But this approach does not
work outside of Europe, and while ANSI-C provides
some rudimentary internationalized string manipulation
functions, it leaves issues of text input and
output to the terminal hardware or terminal driver software.
It is here that R5 makes its real
contribution to internationalization--in an extension
to the setlocale model, an internationalized X
application reads a localization file at startup that
contains information about the text encoding used in
the locale.  This information allows X to correctly
parse strings into characters and figure out how to
display them.
There are a number
of issues surrounding character encoding in
internationalized applications, and it is possible to
explore them in full and confusing detail.  In practice, though,
most of the string encoding details are hidden by the
operating system, or with X internationalization, by
Xlib.  LINKEND="S2-1002-10-2"Section 10.1.2, "Text Representation in an Internationalized Application" explains some of the basics of text
encoding in more detail.When thinking about applications that run in other
languages,
it is important to recognize the distinction between an
internationalized application and a multilingual
application.  A text editor that works in any given
locale is internationalized; a mail reading program
that labels its push buttons with text in the language
of the locale is internationalized, but if it also
allows a user to compose mail in a second language and
include excerpts from a message in a third language,
then it is multilingual.  The requirements and
problems of multilingual applications are not yet well
understood, and the X Consortium made a considered
decision that R5 would support internationalized
applications but not explicitly support multilingual
ones.The following sections continue this introduction
to internationalization with a description of the
ANSI-C setlocale mechanism and a further
discussion of character encoding and text
representation issues.ID="S2-1002-10-1"Internationalization with ANSI-CID="IX-1002-10-21"internationalizationwith ANSI-CID="IX-1002-10-22"ANSI-Cinternationalization withClearly it is not feasible to write an application that
has special case code for the formatting customs of
every country in the world.
A simpler approach is to use a library that reads a
customizing database at startup time.  This database
would contain the currency symbol,
the decimal separator symbol, abbreviations for the
days of the weeks and names of the months in the local
language, the collation sequence of the alphabet, etc.
This is the approach taken by the ANSI-C
library.
The process of writing an application that is
flexible enough to use the values from this database is
called internationalization, and the process of
ID="IX-1002-10-23"localization
creating the runtime database for a locale
is called localization.The first step in any internationalized application is
to establish the locale--to cause the localization
database to be read in.  This is done with
the C library function setlocale.  It takes two
arguments:  a locale category and the locale name.
The locale name specifies the database that should be
used to localize the program, and the locale category
specifies which behaviors (for example, the collation sequence of
the alphabet or the formatting of times and dates)
of the program should be changed.
setlocale will most often be used as shown below:ID="SC-1002-10-1"setlocale(LC_ALL, "");Passing the empty string as the locale name will cause
setlocale to get the name of the locale from
ID="IX-1002-10-24"environment variablesLANGID="IX-1002-10-25"LANG
the operating system environment variable named
LANG.  This allows the application writer to
leave the choice of locale to the end user of the
application.  There is no standard format for locale
names, but they often have the form:ID="SC-1002-10-2"language[_territory[.codeset]]So the locale "Fr" might be used in
France, while "En_GB" might specify English as used in
Great Britain, and "En_US" English as used in the U.S.  The
ID="IX-1002-10-26"codesetcodeset field can be used to specify the encoding
(i.e., the mapping between numbers and characters) to be
used for all strings in the application when there is
not a single default encoding used for the language in
the territory.  The locale "ja_JP.ujis" is an
example--"ujis" is the name of one of the encodings in
common use for Japanese.
The name of the
default locale is simply "C."  This locale is familiar to
American computer users and all C programmers.
Finally, note that the return value of
setlocale is a char *.  It returns the
name of the locale that was just set, or if it is
passed a locale name of NULL (not the same as
""), it will return
the name of the current locale.ID="IX-1002-10-27"LC_ALLThe category LC_ALL instructs setlocale
to set all internationalization behavior defined by
ANSI-C to operate in the given locale.  The locale
may also be specified for each category individually.
The
standard categories (other, non-standard, categories
may also be defined) and the aspects of program behavior that
they control are listed below:LC_COLLATEID="IX-1002-10-28"LC_COLLATEID="IX-1002-10-29"collation
This category defines the collation sequence used by
the ANSI-C library functions strcoll and
strxfrm which are used to order strings
alphabetically.LC_CTYPEID="IX-1002-10-30"LC_CTYPEThis category defines the behavior of the character
classification and case conversion macros (such as
isspace and tolower) defined in
the header file <ctype.h>.  Different languages will have
different classifications for characters.  Not all
characters have uppercase equivalents, for example, and characters
with codes between 128 and 255 which are non-printing
in ASCII are important alphabetic characters in many
European languages.LC_MONETARYID="IX-1002-10-31"LC_MONETARYID="IX-1002-10-32"monetary quantitiesformatting
This category does not affect the behavior of any C
library functions.  The problem of formatting monetary
quantities was deemed too intricate for any standard
library function, so the library simply
provides a way for an application to look up any of the
localized parameters it
needs to do its own formatting of monetary
ID="IX-1002-10-33"localeconvID="IX-1002-10-34"lconv
quantities.  The ANSI-C function localeconv returns a
pointer to a structure of type lconv that
contains the parameters (such as decimal separator,
currency symbol, and flags that indicate whether the
currency symbol should appear before or after positive
and negative quantities, etc.) needed for numeric and
monetary formatting in the current locale.LC_NUMERICID="IX-1002-10-35"LC_NUMERICID="IX-1002-10-36"decimal separators
This category affects the decimal separator used by
printf (and its variants), scanf (and
its variants), gcvt (and related functions),
strtod, and atof.  It also affects the
values in the lconv structure returned by
localeconv.LC_TIMEID="IX-1002-10-37"LC_TIMEID="IX-1002-10-38"strftimeID="IX-1002-10-39"strptimeID="IX-1002-10-40"timedisplaying in internationalized applicationsID="IX-1002-10-41"datesdisplaying in internationalized applications
This category affects the behavior of the time and date
formatting functions strftime and
strptime.  It defines such things as the names
of the days of the week and their standard
abbreviations in the language of the locale.If you use setlocale and the new C library
functions mentioned above (and carefully avoid the use
of the old C functions that they replace), you will be
well on your way to an internationalized application.
For more information on setlocale and the
functions it affects, see the documentation supplied by
your vendor (a UNIX system should have reference pages for
these functions).  The POSIX Programmer's Guide
by Donald Lewine, published by O'Reilly & Associates,

fundamentals of text representation by computer.
Remember that characters displayed
by your computer are represented by numbers.
The correspondence between numbers and
characters (on most American computers) is
defined by the ASCII (American
Standard Code for Information Interchange)
encoding.
There is nothing special about ASCII except that it is
one of the most firmly established standards of the
computer world.  Text composed in one encoding (ASCII,
for example) and displayed in another (perhaps EBCDIC,
still used by IBM mainframes) will be
nonsense because the number-to-character mappings of
the encodings are not the same.ID="IX-1002-10-46"font glyphID="IX-1002-10-47"character set
We've been using the term encoding
rather loosely.  Before we consider text representation
any further, some definitions are appropriate.  A
character is an abstract element of text, distinct
from a font glyph, which is the actual image that
gets displayed.  A
character set is simply a set of characters;
there are no numbers associated with those characters.
We are all familiar with the character set used by
ASCII.  The Latin-1 character set used by many Western European
Latin-based languages is an extension of ASCII that
contains the accented characters required by many of
ID="IX-1002-10-48"encodingsID="IX-1002-10-49"charsetID="IX-1002-10-50"codeset
those languages.  An encoding is any numeric
representation of the characters in a character set.
The term codeset is sometimes used as a synonym
for encoding.
A charset (not the same as a character set) is an
encoding in which all characters
have the same number of bits.  ASCII is a 7-bit
encoding, for example, and is therefore a charset.
LINKEND="FG-1002-10-1"Figure 10-1
diagrams the relationship between character
sets, charsets, fonts, and font glyphs.ID="FG-1002-10-1"Character sets, encodings, charsets, fonts, and glyphsFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.10.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-10-1"The last two fields of an
X font name specify a charset.  By
definition, the index of a font glyph in the font is
the same as the encoding of the corresponding character
in that charset.  When the encoding of a locale is a
charset, this obviously simplifies matters a great deal:
text in the locale can be displayed using glyphs from
a single font, and the character encoding can be used
directly as the index of the corresponding font glyph.ID="IX-1002-10-51"Japanese textNot all languages can be represented with a single
charset, however.  Japanese text, for example, commonly
requires Japanese ideographic characters, Japanese
phonetic characters, and Latin characters.  Each of
these character sets has its own standard fixed-width
encoding, and is therefore a charset.  Note, however,
that the ideographic charset is 16-bits wide while the
phonetic and Latin charsets are 8-bits wide.  Full
Japanese text display requires a font for each charset,
and Japanese text representation requires a
"super-encoding" that combines each of the component
encodings.  There are, in fact, several encodings
commonly used for Japanese text.  What they have in
common is the use of "shift sequences" to indicate
which charset the following character belongs to.It is crucial to the concept of a locale that each
locale has a single well-defined encoding.  Many
languages have only a single standardized encoding.
If a language can be encoded
in more than one standard way, each encoding defines a
locale of its own, and the name of the encoding
is part of the name of the locale.ID="S3-1002-10-1"ISO8859-1 and Other EncodingsID="IX-1002-10-52"ISO8859-1 character setID="IX-1002-10-53"Latin-1ID="IX-1002-10-54"xfdID="IX-1002-10-55"ASCII character setIf you examine the names of the X fonts on
your system (using xlsfonts) you will probably
find that most of them have the charset "iso8859-1."This charset is sometimes called "Latin-1" and was
designed to be suitable for use by most Western
European languages (Greek being a notable exception).
The character set of ISO8859-1 comprises all the ASCII
characters plus a wide variety of accented and special
characters.  (You can take a look at the characters
using the xfd program.)  Because there are
ID="IX-1002-10-56"encodings8-bitID="IX-1002-10-57"8-bit encoding
fewer than 256 characters in the set, ISO8859-1 can use
a state-independent 8-bit encoding.  This means that
all characters are 8 bits long, and there are no
special shift sequences that modify the
interpretation of characters.  Because there are not
any shift sequences, it is possible to use the encoding
of all Latin-1 characters directly as font indices.ISO8859-1 contains a
superset of the ASCII characters.
Every character in the ASCII character set has
the same encoding in Latin-1 as it does in ASCII.
(But Latin-1 does not define any control characters
such as linefeed, backspace or the bell character.)
Because it is an
8-bit encoding, Latin-1 strings can be represented using
the usual C
null-terminated array of char.  Because the characters
are a uniform 8 bits and because strings do not contain
embedded shift states, it is possible to use Latin-1
strings with the standard C string manipulation
routines (strlen, strcat, etc.)  In
conjunction with the ANSI-C internationalization
facilities, the careful design of ISO8859-1 means that
most programs originally written for ASCII use can
easily be ported for use in most Western European
countries.ID="IX-1002-10-58"Japanese textBut it is not so simple once we try to go beyond Western Europe
and Latin-based alphabets.  Japanese text, for example,
commonly uses (at least within the computer industry)
words written in the Latin alphabet along with phonetic
characters from the katakana and hiragana
alphabets and ideographic kanji characters.  Each
of these types of text has its own charset (8- or
16-bit), but they must be combined into a single
ID="IX-1002-10-59"shift sequencesID="IX-1002-10-60"locking shifts
encoding for Japanese text.  This is done with
shift sequences, bytes embedded in the running text
which control the character set in which the following
character will be interpreted.  It is possible to use
"locking shifts" which modify the interpretation of the
next and subsequent characters, but this scheme is
infrequently used because it makes strings of text very
difficult to manipulate.ID="IX-1002-10-61"compound textID="IX-1002-10-62"stringsCompound Text
Compound Text is another text representation that is
used in X applications.  Compound Text strings identify
their encoding using embedded escape sequences (they
can also have multiple sub-strings with multiple
encodings) and are therefore locale-independent.  The
Compound Text representation was standardized as part
of X11R4 for use as a text interchange format for
interclient communication.  It is often used to encode
text properties and for the transfer of text via
selections, and is not intended for text representation
internal to an application.  There are new R5
routines that convert X property values to and from the
Compound Text representation.  Note that Compound Text
is not the same thing as the Compound Strings used by
the Motif widget set.ID="S3-1002-10-2"Multi-byte Strings and Wide-character StringsID="IX-1002-10-63"stringsmulti-bytemulti-byte stringsID="IX-1002-10-64"multi-byte stringsID="IX-1002-10-65"wide-character stringsID="IX-1002-10-66"stringswide-characterwide-character stringsStrings in encodings that contain shift sequences and
characters with non-uniform width can be stored in
standard NULL-terminated arrays of characters,
but can be difficult to work with in this form:  the
number of characters in a string cannot be assumed to
be equal to the number of bytes, and it is not possible
to iterate through the characters in a string by simply
incrementing a pointer.  On the other hand, strings
of char are usefully passed to standard
functions like strcat and strcpy, and
assuming a terminal that understands the encoding,
functions like printf work correctly with these
strings.ID="IX-1002-10-67"wide-character typeID="IX-1002-10-68"wchar_t
As an alternative to these multi-byte strings,
ANSI-C defines a wide-character type,
wchar_t, in which each character has a fixed
size and occupies one array element in the string.
(The wchar_t is 2 bytes on some systems, 4
bytes on others, and may be 1 byte on systems that
support nothing but the default C locale.)
ANSI-C defines functions to convert between
multi-byte and wide-character strings:
mblen, mbstowcs, mbtowc,
wcstombs, and wctomb.  LINKEND="FN-1002-10-3"ID="FN-1002-10-3"If your C library does not define these functions, you
can try the library contributed with R5 in
contrib/lib/Xwchar.
As you can see
here, and as you will see with the R5
internationalized text input and output functions,
"multi-byte" is commonly abbreviated "mb" in function
names, and "wide character" is abbreviated "wc."Multi-byte
strings are usually more compact than wide-character
strings, but wide-character strings are easier to work
with.  Note that ANSI-C does not provide
wide-character string manipulation functions.  There
is, however, a contributed library of wide character
functions that is shipped with the MIT R5 release;
see the directory contrib/lib/Xwchar.In an internationalized application, you must take care
to handle all strings properly.  Unfortunately the
ANSI-C library does not provide adequate functions
or conventions for sophisticated internationalized text
manipulation.  Note, though, that many applications can do
internationalized text input and output without
performing any manipulations on that text.  The
following list gives a few guidelines for handling
internationalized strings:
ID="IX-1002-10-69"internationalizationstringsID="IX-1002-10-70"stringsinternationalizedMARK="BULLET"Multi-byte strings are null-terminated.  There is no single
convention for the termination of wide character
strings, but strings passed to wcstombs are
null-terminated.  As was the case before R5, X text
output and input functions take and return strings with
a count of the characters they contain.ID="IX-1002-10-71"encodingsID="IX-1002-10-72"state-dependent encodingsand multi-byte stringsID="IX-1002-10-73"concatenating stringsID="IX-1002-10-74"stringsconcatenating
If an encoding is state-dependent (i.e., if it uses
locking shifts) multi-byte strings are assumed to begin in the default
shift state of the encoding.  There is no convention
for the shift state at the end of a string, so when
concatenating two strings, the first may need to be
reset to the default shift state in order to guarantee
correct interpretation of the second.  In practice,
state-dependent encodings are rarely used.None of the C library string-handling functions work
with wide-character strings.ID="IX-1002-10-75"strcatID="IX-1002-10-76"strcmpID="IX-1002-10-77"strcpyID="IX-1002-10-78"strlenID="IX-1002-10-79"strncmpID="IX-1002-10-80"stringscomparison routines
The following C string-handling functions may be safely
used with multi-byte strings (in a state-independent
encoding): strcat, strcmp, strcpy,
strlen, strncmp.  Note that the string
comparison routines are only useful to check for
byte-for-byte equality.  To compare strings for
sorting, use strcoll.ID="IX-1002-10-81"multi-byte stringswritingID="IX-1002-10-82"output streamsand multi-byte strings
Multi-byte strings can be written to file or output
streams.  Assuming a terminal that operates in the current
locale, printing a multi-byte string to stdout
or stderr will cause the correct text to be
displayed.ID="IX-1002-10-83"multi-byte stringsreadingID="IX-1002-10-84"input streamsand multi-byte strings
Multi-byte strings can be read from files or from the
stdin input stream.  If the file is encoded in
the current locale, or the terminal operates in the
locale, then the strings that are read will be
meaningful.ID="S2-1002-10-3"Internationalization Using XID="IX-1002-10-85"internationalizationand XThe techniques of internationalization described so far
have had little to do with X, and they have been
sufficient only to internationalize a terminal-based
application.  X applications draw text directly into
their windows and get input directly from keyboard
events.  When an application must use multi-byte
strings in an encoding that contains shift sequences
and non-uniform width characters, deciding which
characters to draw can be tricky, and when a language
contains far more characters than fit on a keyboard,
interpreting KeyPress events becomes difficult.
Additionally, X clients often
communicate with other clients.  Because
internationalized clients can run in different locales an
internationalized interclient communication method is required.
Also, X clients make heavy use of resource files and
databases, and will need a mechanism for the correct
localization of resources.  The internationalization of
R5 is based on the ANSI-C locale
model, but the function setlocale is not
sufficient for locale management in an X application.
Two new functions are defined which are used along with
setlocale when an X application starts up.
Finally, all these new
internationalization features of Xlib will require some
changes to the Xt architecture as well.The sections below cover these topics as follows:MARK="BULLET"LINKEND="S1-1002-10-2"Section 10.2, "Locale Management in X" describes the X locale management

way as a ANSI-C terminal-based internationalized
program:  with a call to setlocale.  An X
program, however, generally goes two steps further.ID="IX-1002-10-87"XSupportsLocaleImmediately after calling setlocale, an
application should call XSupportsLocale() to
determine if the Xlib implementation supports the current locale.  This
function takes no arguments and return a Bool.
If this function returns False, an application will
typically print a "Locale not supported" message and exit.ID="IX-1002-10-88"XSetLocaleModifiersAfter verifying that the locale is supported, an
application should call XSetLocaleModifiers().
A "locale modifier" can be thought of as an extension
to the name of a locale; it specifies more information
about the desired localized behavior of an application.
R5 as shipped
by MIT recognizes one locale modifier, used to specify the
input method (see LINKEND="CH-1002-10-1"Chapter 10, "Internationalization") to be used for
internationalized text input for the locale.XSetLocaleModifiers() allows the programmer to
specify a list of modifiers (usually none) which will
be concatenated with a list of user-specified modifiers from an
operating system environment variable
(XMODIFIERS in POSIX).  The strings passed to
XSetLocaleModifiers() and set in the
XMODIFIERS environment variable are a series of
concatenated "@category=value" strings.
Thus to specify that the "Xwnmo" input method should be
used by an application, a user might set the XMODIFIERS
as follows:ID="SC-1002-10-3"setenv XMODIFIERS @im=_XWNMOLINKEND="EX-1002-10-1"Example 10-1 shows code that uses setlocale and

programs in an environment that does not have
setlocale, include the header file

X_LOCALE defined, it defines setlocale
as a macro for an Xlib-internal function.  Otherwise,
it simply includes the standard header

the real setlocale.ID="S1-1002-10-3"Internationalized Text Output in XID="IX-1002-10-92"internationalizationtext;outputBefore R5, the Xlib drawing routines made the
fundamental assumption that the encoding of a character
was equal to the index of the character's glyph in the
font.  As explained in LINKEND="S2-1002-10-2"Section 10.1.2, "Text Representation in an Internationalized Application,"
this is a useful and valid assumption when text in a
language can be most naturally encoded as an 8- or 16-bit
wide charset.  Unfortunately, it is not valid in many
important cases.ID="IX-1002-10-93"XFontSetR5 bases its new text output routines on a new Xlib
abstraction, the XFontSet.  An XFontSet
is bound to the locale in which it is created, and
contains all the fonts needed to display text in that
locale, or all the independent charsets used in the
ID="IX-1002-10-94"Japanese text
encoding of that locale.  Technical Japanese text, for
example, often mixes Latin with Japanese characters, so
for a Japanese locale, fonts might be required with the
charsets jisx0208.1983-0 for Kanji ideographic
characters, jisx0201.1976-0 for Kana phonetic
characters, and iso8859-1 for Latin characters.ID="IX-1002-10-95"internationalizationtext;drawingDrawing internationalized text in R5 is conceptually
very similar to drawing text in X11R4--there are
routines that allow you to query font metrics,
measure strings, and
draw strings.  The new R5 functions use
an XFontSet rather than an XFontStruct
or a font specified in a graphics context.  The drawing
and measuring routines interpret text in the encoding
of the locale of the fontset, and correctly map wide or
multi-byte characters to the corresponding font glyph (or glyphs).ID="S2-1002-10-4"Creating and Manipulating FontsetsID="IX-1002-10-96"font setcreatingID="IX-1002-10-97"base font name listA fontset is created with a call to XCreateFontSet().
This function checks the current setting of the locale
to determine which charsets are required for the
locale, and uses a supplied base font name list
to load a set of fonts that supply those charsets.  A
base font name list can be a single wildcarded font
name that specifies little more than the desired size
of the fonts, or it can be a (comma separated) list of
partially wildcarded font names, or it can even be a
list of fully-specified names.  Note of course that if
a fully-specified base font name list is used, it will
only work for one particular locale.  Generally you
will want to use a very generic base font name, and
allow the end user to override it (to choose individual
typefaces that look good together, for example) with
application resources.XCreateFontSet() returns a
list of the charsets for which no font could be found,
and a default string that will be drawn in place of
characters from the missing charset or charsets.  The
ID="IX-1002-10-98"XFreeStringList
list of missing charsets should be freed with a call to
XFreeStringList().  The returned default string
should not be freed by the programmer.

        .If you use a very generic base font name list, be aware
that XCreateFontSet() may have to search through
a large number of font names in order to find fonts of
the appropriate charset.  Also, when using an R5 X
server, try to specify a base font name that will not
require scaling.  For example, many of the Japanese
fonts shipped with the MIT distribution are defined at
odd point sizes (11, 13, 15, etc.) instead of the
even sizes more commonly used for Latin-1 fonts.  If
your base font name list specifies a 14-point font, the
X server or font server may have to scale thousands of
ideographic characters, causing a significant
delay in your application; the server may even
freeze up while the scaling is performed.  See Chapter 6 and

one-to-one mapping between characters and font
glyphs--the glyph used to display a character depends
on the position of the character in the string.
In other languages,
a sequence of characters may map to a single glyph or a
single character may map to multiple glyphs.  In cases
like this, it is not possible to assume that the width
of a string is the sum of the widths of its component
characters, and it may not be possible to insert or
delete a character from a displayed string without
redrawing the surrounding characters.  The only safe assumption
is that context dependencies do not extend beyond whitespace in a string.  An example of context dependencies
in the English language is the use of ligatures in
typeset text--the substitution of the special glyphs
"fl ligature" and "fi ligature" for the character
sequences "fl" and "fi."This is an artificial
example though, and for
practical purposes, no Latin-based language has context
dependencies.The function XContextDependentDrawing() returns
True if the locale associated with a font set
includes context dependencies in text drawing.  An
internationalized application could use this function
to check if it can take the various shortcuts allowed
in non-context dependent locales.
If XSupportsLocale() returns True, then
any context dependencies in the text of a locale are

languages such as Hebrew and Arabic which are drawn right-to-left
except for numbers which are drawn left-to-right.  In
this case it is not valid to assume that characters
that are adjacent in a string will be adjacent when
displayed.  R5 does not make any provisions for

XTextWidth() and XTextExtents().  They
require an XFontSet and either a multi-byte or
wide-character string.  They are described below:Xmb/XwcTextEscapement()LINKEND="FN-1002-10-4"ID="IX-1002-10-112"XmbTextEscapementID="IX-1002-10-113"XwcTextEscapementID="IX-1002-10-114"textescapement, obtainingID="FN-1002-10-4"In this and following sections, functions that
operate on multi-byte (mb) strings and the equivalent
functions that operate on wide characters (wc) will
often be grouped together and named with this
Xmb/Xwc syntax.  For Xmb functions, the
text argument is of type char *, and the
length argument gives the number of bytes in the
string, which may not be the number of characters.  In
Xwc functions, the text argument is of
type wchar_t *, and the length argument
specifies the number of wide characters in the string,
which is not the same as the number of bytes.
Return the number of pixels the given string would
require in the x dimension if drawn.Xmb/XwcTextExtents()ID="IX-1002-10-115"XmbTextExtentsID="IX-1002-10-116"XwcTextExtentsID="IX-1002-10-117"text eventscomputing
Return the text escapement as the value of the
function, and also return a bounding box for all the
ink in the string, and a bounding box for all the ink
plus intercharacter and interline spacing.LINKEND="FN-1002-10-5"ID="FN-1002-10-5"The public release R5 version of the Xsi implementation had
some serious bugs.  However, later patches from the X Consortium
fixed many of them.  You should make an effort to get a patched
version before attempting to use Xsi.The term "escapement" is used instead of "width" to
emphasize that Xmb/XwcTextEscapement()
returns a positive value whether text is drawn
left-to-right or right-to-left.
This differs from XTextWidth() which
returns a negative width for strings drawn
right-to-left.There is another pair of text extent functions that are
useful when there are context dependencies in the
displayed text.  Xmb/XwcTextPerCharExtents()ID="IX-1002-10-118"textconversion;to Compound Text encoding
return the escapement and extents of a string as the
above functions do, but also return the ink extents and
the logical extents of each character in the string.
These extents are measured relative to the drawing
origin of the string, not the origin of the particular
glyph.  Note that these extents are returned for each
character of the string, not for each font glyph
displayed.  If a sequence of characters map to a single
glyph, each of those characters will have identical
extent rectangles.  Similarly if a single character
requires several font glyphs to display, its extents
will be the combined extents of those glyphs.  The
dimensions of the rectangle are independent of the
drawing direction of the character.LINKEND="FN-1002-10-6"ID="FN-1002-10-6"As this book goes to press, there are two major bugs
in the Xsi implementation of
Xmb/XwcTextPerCharExtents().  First, the returned
per-character metrics are not relative to the drawing
origin--the logical extents rectangles all have an
x-coordinate of 0.  Second, these functions do not
allow a programmer to pass NULL for bounding boxes or
arrays of bounding boxes that are not of interest--a
dummy pointer to valid memory must always be passed.LINKEND="EX-1002-10-4"Example 10-4 in the next section shows a use of XmbTextExtents()

}ID="S1-1002-10-4"String Encoding Changes for InternationalizationID="IX-1002-10-129"string encodingsID="IX-1002-10-130"internationalizationand string encodingPerhaps the most fundamental concern of
internationalization is the encoding of strings.  So
far we've considered text
drawing and string input, and have used
multi-byte or wide-character strings in the encoding of
the locale.  Because X is a networked window system,
however, an X client must communicate with the X
server, usually with a window manager, sometimes with a
session manager, and often with other clients through
the X selection mechanism (which is used to implement
copy-and-paste).  When we allow the internationalization
of X programs, we must confront the issues of
communication between clients that use different
locales, and of communication between an
internationalized client and a "locale-neutral" X
server.  Furthermore we must make decisions about the
encodings of any other strings used in the X and Xt
specifications.Some of the issues that must be considered are the
appropriate encoding for color and font names passed to
the X server, the encoding of bitmap files, the
encoding of strings selected in one client and copied
to another, and the encoding of resource values and
names.  When making decisions on questions like these,
the designers of X internationalization had several
choices.  They could specify that particular strings
were:MARK="BULLET"In the encoding of the locale.In the COMPOUND_TEXT encoding, in
which each string is encoded along with the name of its
encoding.In the STRING encoding, which is Latin-1 plus the
newline and tab control characters.In ASCII, which as the encoding of the C language, is
actually fairly portable.In an implementation-dependent encoding.Not in any encoding, and are simply interpreted as a
sequence of bytes.ID="IX-1002-10-131"compound textID="IX-1002-10-132"stringsconverting from one locale to anotherID="IX-1002-10-133"localeconverting strings betweenCompound text is an encoding designed to represent text
from any locale.  As such it is well
suited to be a standard string format for clients that
communicate using string properties.  It does not,
however, address the problem of converting strings from
one locale to another, and often this is simply not
possible.  In most cases it is not meaningful to
select text from an application running in one locale
and paste it into an application running in a different
one.  This is the realm of multilingual applications
which are not addressed by R5.Note that the above list refers to the COMPOUND_TEXT
and STRING encodings.  These capitalized names refer to
the Atom names used in the ICCCM to specify the type of
a "Property."  The ICCCM also specifies a selection
conversion target Atom, TEXT, which simply means a
string in whatever encoding is convenient for the
selection owner.Sometimes the best choice of encodings is ASCII.
It may seem unfair to non-English locales that the
ASCII encoding should be singled out for special
treatment, but for strings that are to be shared
between X client and X server (such as Display,
Property, and font and color names) some standard encoding
must be specified.
Because ASCII is widespread and is the usual encoding
for C programming, it is a natural choice.  In many
cases, though, it is not the specific ASCII encoding that
is important, but the fact that there is some common
encoding for all the characters used by ASCII.  R5
never actually refers to ASCII.
Instead, it defines the X Portable
Character Set as a set of basic characters that must
exist in all locales supported by Xlib.  Those
characters are:ID="SC-1002-10-4"a..z A..Z 0..9
!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
<space>, <tab>, and <newline>ID="IX-1002-10-134"Host Portable Character EncodingR5 also defines the Host Portable Character
Encoding as the encoding for that character set.
The encoding itself is not defined; the only
requirement is that the same encoding is used for all
locales on a given host machine.  A string in the Host
Portable Character Encoding is understood to contain
only characters from the X Portable Character Set.
ID="IX-1002-10-135"Latin Portable Character EncodingID="IX-1002-10-136"Latin-1
Finally, the Latin Portable Character Encoding is
the characters of the X Portable Character Set encoded
as a subset of the Latin-1 encoding.  (Latin-1 is
itself a superset of ASCII.)  Note that if an X client
running on one host has a different portable encoding
than an X server running on a different host, then
translation from one encoding to the other will be
required (for color names, font names, etc.) and would
be done by the Xlib communication layer.  In
practice, however, it is likely that all systems will
simply use an encoding which is a superset of ASCII,
(with the possible exception of mainframes that use EBCDIC)
and therefore all characters in the X Portable
Character Set will share a single, standard (ASCII)
encoding.  Appendix K of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual summarizes all the encodings.ID="IX-1002-10-137"client-to-window-managerinternationalizationID="IX-1002-10-138"client-to-clientinternationalization
String-encoding issues arise throughout Xlib,
and particularly so for functions that involve X
properties and resource databases.
The internationalization of client-to-window-manager
and client-to-client communication via properties is
described in 10.5 below and the
internationalization of X resource databases is
discussed in 10.6.  Here we itemize
the remaining changes to the Xlib specification that
involve string encodings.

make this assumption.  The first is a convenience
routine for communication with window managers.
XmbSetWMProperties() is a function very similar
to XSetWMProperties(), except that the
window_name and icon_name arguments are multi-byte
strings (rather than XTextProperty pointers) in
the encoding of the locale.  If these strings can be
converted to the STRING encoding (Latin-1 plus
newline and tab), then their corresponding
WM_NAME and WM_ICON_NAME properties are
created with type STRING.  If this conversion
cannot be performed, the strings are converted to
Compound Text (this conversion can always be done, by
the definition of Compound Text), and the properties
are created with type COMPOUND_TEXT.  Note that
there is no wide-character version of this function.Since X properties have a single contiguous block of
data as their value, they cannot directly represent
types such as char **.  But sometimes such a
complex type must be represented (imagine a text editor
setting a property to a set of disjointed selected
strings).  To allow this, X11R4 defined the
XTextProperty structure (shown in

characters of the string can be converted.  If two
locales use the same character set but simply encode
those characters differently, then strings will be
fully convertible between the locales.  But imagine
trying to convert from French text to ASCII--any
accented characters would be unconvertible because they
simply do not exist in the ASCII character set.  When
converting between languages as dissimilar as Arabic and
Korean, for example, there will be no convertible
characters.  LINKEND="FN-1002-10-7"ID="FN-1002-10-7"If Korean is the current (supported) locale, and the

When there are unconvertible characters in a string,
the conversion functions substitute a locale-dependent
default string (encoded in the current locale).  The
value of the default string may be queried with
XDefaultString(), and may be the empty string ("").
There is no way to set the value of the default string.
The
default string is independent of the default string
used by the R5 text-drawing routines when an
XFontSet does not contain all the characters
needed to represent text in a locale.ID="S1-1002-10-6"Localization of Resource DatabasesID="IX-1002-10-235"resource databaseslocalization ofID="IX-1002-10-236"localizationof resource databasesID="IX-1002-10-237"resource namesand localizationWe've seen that X resources are a useful way to allow
the localization of strings--rather than hardcoding its
strings, an X client can look them all up by name from
a locale-dependent resource file.  The twist here is
that although resource values can be localized, and may
contain text in the encoding of the locale,
resource names must still be hardcoded into the
application.  As you might expect, R5 specifies that
resource names in the Host Portable Character Encoding
are always supported, and that any other encodings are
implementation-dependent.  What this means is that a
Chinese user who wishes to customize the
behavior of an application written by a Japanese
programmer will have to specify values for resources
that are named using Latin characters in the X
Portable Character Set.  Those resource names may be
English phonetic representations of Japanese words
which are mnemonic to the Japanese programmer, but
which are meaningless to the Chinese (or American)
user.  This situation is unfortunate but there is no
way around it within the scope of the X Resource
Manager mechanisms.  If resource names are to be
localized, they would have to be looked up in a
database as well, and then we would need hardcoded
names for the names.  Another approach would be to
use resource numbers in place of resource names.  These
remain constant across all locales, but where a
resource name is mnemonic to the original programmer, at least, a
resource number would be mnemonic to no one.When a resource file or string are parsed into an
XrmDatabase(), that parsing is done in the
current locale, and the database is bound to that
locale even if the current locale changes.  We can speak of the
"locale of the database" in the same way that we speak
of the "locale of the XFontSet."  To determine
the locale of a database, call
XrmLocaleOfDatabase().

The following guidelines summarize the requirements for
ANSI-C and R5-based internationalization:MARK="BULLET"Set the locale desired by the user by calling
setlocale with the empty string ("") as
the locale name argument.  Verify that the locale is
supported by Xlib with XSupportsLocale().  Set
the X locale modifiers as desired by the user by
passing the empty string to
XSetLocaleModifiers().  In an X Toolkit
application, use XtSetLanguageProc to register
a procedure to set the locale.  The default language
procedure (which is not actually registered by default)
performs all of the above functions.Use ANSI-C functions such as strcoll and
strftime which make use of the current setting
of the locale.  Avoid the superseded functions that do
not.Place all strings which will be displayed by the
application in an X resource file.  Use X Resource
Manager functions in the application to look those
strings up.Do not assume that the strings your application handles
have a uniform state-independent encoding.  Treat them
as multi-byte strings or convert them to wide-character
strings.Create an XFontSet for the locale and use it
with the new R5 text output functions to measure and
display multi-byte and wide-character strings.Use XmbSetWMProperties() to set the essential
properties for communication with the window
manager.Use the new R5 property routines to convert from or
to the encoding of the current locale when setting or
reading text properties.Pay attention to the encoding of strings such as Atom
and Display names, font and color names, resource
names, and resource values specifications.Use the new X input method mechanisms to get correctly
encoded multi-byte and wide-character input.  LINKEND="CH-1002-11-1"Chapter 11, "Internationalized Text Input

assume any particular mapping between keystrokes and
input characters.  An internationalized program
must run in any locale on a single
workstation, using a single keyboard.  The mapping
between keystrokes and Japanese
characters is very different (and more complex) than
the mapping between keystrokes and Latin characters,
for example.  When there are more characters in the
codeset of a locale than there are keys on a keyboard,
some sort of input method is required for mapping
between multiple keystrokes and input characters.

is a complex topic, we begin with a discussion of the
important issues of internationalized text input in LINKEND="S1-1002-11-1"Section 11.1, "Issues of Internationalized Text Input"
and an overview of the X input method architecture in LINKEND="S1-1002-11-2"Section 11.2, "Overview of the X Input Method Architecture."
The remaining sections explain the
individual topics required in order to implement
internationalized text input.Before beginning with internationalized text input,
bear in mind that input methods are a technology that has
previously been used only in ad hoc ways for specific
languages.  Driven by industry demand, it has very
quickly advanced from research
topic to X Consortium standard, and now must operate
correctly in any locale.  It is a difficult problem
and R5 does not provide a complete solution.  One
frustration is the ambiguity, in places, of the XIM
specification, which defines how an input method interacts with
an Xlib application.  This book attempts to resolve
those ambiguities in reasonable ways, but in practice,
much remains "implementation defined," and internationalized programs
may have to be tailored to operate correctly with a few
particular target input methods.  None of the input methods
that are shipped with R5 are part of the core
distribution, and none are fully robust or well
documented (not in English, at least).  The XIM
designers envision that their internationalized text
input mechanism will be incorporated within toolkits
and Xt widgets, and thus will be hidden from most
programmers.  Until these widgets are available,
however, performing truly internationalized text input
may be a difficult task.R5 as shipped from MIT contains two separate implementations of the
ID="IX-1002-11-8"Xsi input methodID="IX-1002-11-9"XimpID="IX-1002-11-10"input methodsinternationalization
input method internationalization facilities.  The "Xsi" 
implementation is the default on all but Sony machines,
which use the "Ximp" implementation.  Each
implementation defines its own protocol for
communication between Xlib and input methods (which are implemented
as Separate processes).
Ximp and Xsi each come with contributed input methods which are not
compatible with each other.  Steps are now going on within the X
Consortium to standardize on one of these implementations, so you
should enquire about the status of that effort before putting
significant effort into a product using one of these implementations.ID="S1-1002-11-1"Issues of Internationalized Text InputThink for a moment about how we use a keyboard to enter
text into a computer.  There are not enough keys on a
standard keyboard for all the lowercase and
uppercase letters used in English as well as the number
and punctuation characters, so we use a shift key to
effectively double the number of characters we can
enter.But for many European languages, this technique is not
sufficient.  The most common accented characters may
appear directly on a keyboard (the È, Ë, and Á 
in French, for example) but this still leaves
a variety of other characters that cannot be entered
with any single shifted or unshifted keystroke.  French
typewriters have a key that will produce an umlaut or
a caret, without advancing the carriage, so to produce
a ˚,
for example, you would strike the
caret key followed by the "u" key.  In computer
systems, a variety of methods have been developed for
entering these accented characters.  Often they involve
a Compose key (found on many DEC keyboards) or any
"dead key" which, does not send a code when struck but
places the keyboard into a special compose mode
(sometimes indicated by a light on the keyboard) in
which one or more of the following keystrokes are
combined into a single character.  If this sort of
input method is implemented in the keyboard hardware
or in the operating system software, then it behaves
transparently to the programmer who can simply read
characters, assured that the user will have some way of
entering any text desired.ID="IX-1002-11-11"Asian languagesID="IX-1002-11-12"Chinese textID="IX-1002-11-13"ideographic languagesID="IX-1002-11-14"languagesideographicID="IX-1002-11-15"languagesideographic;Asian languages
As with internationalized text output, it is with the
Asian ideographic languages
that things become complicated.  Japanese and Korean
both have phonetic alphabets that are small enough to
physically map onto a keyboard.  It is sometimes
adequate to leave text in this phonetic alphabet, but
usually the user will want the final text to be in the
full ideographic language.  Input methods for these
languages commonly have the user type the phonetic
symbols for a particular word or words and signal somehow
when this composition or pre-editing is finished.
The input method then looks up that string of phonetic
characters in a dictionary and converts it to the
equivalent character or characters in the ideographic system.
Sometimes there will be more than one character with a
given phonetic representation, in which case the user
will have to select between them.These methods are obviously more complex than European
compose methods.  They are modal, and must display a
lot of state information.  It is not enough
to have a keyboard light that tells users that they are
composing an ideographic character; the computer must display the phonetic
characters as the user types them, allow the user to
edit them, and then when the user is done, compose them
into an ideographic character or characters.  The
conversion from phonetic to ideographic characters
requires a large dictionary, and
finally, as noted above, the input method may have to
display a menu or popup dialog box so the user can
choose among ideograms with the same phonetic
representation.Because input methods can be so large and complex, and
because they vary so much from locale to locale, it
does not make sense to link every application with a
generic input method which is somehow localized at
ID="IX-1002-11-16"input manager
application startup.  Instead, an input manager
is usually run as a separate process that communicates with
the X server and with the application.  At application
startup, the setting of the locale or the "im" locale
modifier determines to which
input manager the application establishes a connection.
R5 provides new routines and datatypes in Xlib
which support this sort of internationalized text
input.  The next section provides an overview of the
Xlib architecture for internationalized text input.ID="S1-1002-11-2"Overview of the X Input Method ArchitectureThe sections below present an overview of the concepts,
datatypes, and functions used in R5 to support input
methods.  An understanding of material presented here
will make the implementation details presented in
later sections easier to follow.ID="S2-1002-11-1"Input Methods and Input ServersID="IX-1002-11-17"input methodsand input serversID="IX-1002-11-18"input serversAn internationalized X application gets user text input
by communicating with an input method.  At application
startup, the application is localized by opening the
particular input method appropriate for the locale.
Often, opening an input method causes Xlib to establish
a connection to another process known as the "input
manager" or "input server."  The input manager can
provide input method service to multiple X clients that
use the same locale.  Sometimes an input manager will
connect to a third process, the translation server,
which performs dictionary lookup and translation from
pre-edit text (often phonetic) to composed text (often
ideographic).  The details of input method architecture
are of course implementation dependent.  Simple input
methods, for example, can be implemented directly in Xlib,
without need of other processes.  The default Xsi
implementation shipped with the MIT distribution does
just this for European compose
methods that do not require any dictionary lookup or
graphical feedback.
LINKEND="FG-1002-11-1"Figure 11-1
diagrams several possible connections between a
client and its input method.ID="FG-1002-11-1"Possible input method architecturesFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.11.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-11-1"ID="IX-1002-11-19"front-end input methodID="IX-1002-11-20"back-end input methodThe XIM architecture was designed to support two models
of input method, known as front-end and back-end
methods.  A front-end input method intercepts
events from the X server before they reach the
application.  A back-end method filters events
from the application, before the application has
processed them.  Because internationalized programs
must support either model of input method, the
distinction is of little importance to the programmer.
It is discussed in the XIM specification, however, and
you may run across it in other discussions of input
methods.Recall the distinction between internationalized and
multilingual applications.  There is nothing to
prevent an application from opening multiple input
methods for multiple locales, but internationalized
applications will generally operate only in a single
locale and will therefore only need a single input
method.ID="S2-1002-11-2"User Interaction with an Input MethodID="IX-1002-11-21"input methodsuser interaction withID="IX-1002-11-22"screensand input methodsID="IX-1002-11-23"interaction stylesIn order for a complex input method to provide feedback or
otherwise interact with the user, it must have regions
of the screen that it can draw text or bitmaps into.
The X Input Method specification defines three of these
areas:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-11-24"Status areaThe Status area is an output-only window in which
the input method can display information about its
internal state.  It can be thought of as a logical
extension of the keyboard mode indicators, such as the
Caps Lock indicator.  The client generally provides this area
to the input method, but the input method is solely
responsible for its contents.ID="IX-1002-11-25"PreeditThe Preedit area is the region for the display of
the intermediate text typed while composing a
character.  The client generally provides this area to the
input method, which is responsible for its contents.ID="IX-1002-11-26"Auxiliary areaThe Auxiliary area is a transient window used
for any popup menus or dialog boxes that are needed by
the input method.  This area is managed entirely by the
input method.The location and use of the Preedit and Status areas depend on the
interaction style used between the application and the
input method.  Four interaction styles are

When using this style, the application can display the

already composed text.The client must choose an interaction style
from a list of styles supported by the input method, and
must provide the Preedit and Status areas as required
by that style.  Additionally, in the case of
on-the-spot pre-editing, the client must supply
callbacks that the input method can call to control the

This function establishes a connection to the input
method appropriate for the current locale, and returns
an opaque handle of type XIM.  Opening an input
ID="IX-1002-11-32"XIM
method is conceptually similar to opening a display,
and the XIM returned is analogous to the
Display * returned by XOpenDisplay().  An
input method is bound to the particular locale that was
in effect when it was created, even if this locale is
subsequently changed.  XOpenIM() and related
functions are documented in LINKEND="S2-1002-11-11"Section 11.4.1, "Opening and Closing an Input Method."ID="S2-1002-11-4"The X Input ContextID="IX-1002-11-33"input contextscreatingID="IX-1002-11-34"XCreateICJust as the X server can display multiple windows for a
single client, an input method can maintain multiple
input contexts for an application.  The function
XCreateIC() creates a new input context in an
input method.  The function returns an opaque handle of
type XIC.  Like the Window or
GC types,  XIC has a number of
attributes which can be set.  These attributes control
the interaction style for input done under that
context, the regions to be used for the Preedit and
Status areas, the XFontSet with which the text should
be drawn, and so on.  XCreateIC() and
related
routines to set and get the values of input context
attributes are documented in LINKEND="S2-1002-11-14"Section 11.5.2, "Creating and Destroying Input Contexts."A text editor that supported multiple editing
windows within a single top-level window could choose
to create one IC for each editing window,
or to share only one IC among all such windows.  In the
first case, each window would have different Preedit
and Status
areas, and each could be in a different intermediate
state of pre-editing.  In the second case, there
would be a single Preedit and a single Status area
shared by all editing windows, and the
application would probably reset the state of the IC
each time the input focus moved from one window to
another.ID="S2-1002-11-5"Input Context Focus ManagementID="IX-1002-11-35"input contextsfocusID="IX-1002-11-36"input focussettingBecause there is only one keyboard associated with an X
display, X allows only one window to have the input
focus at a time.  For the same reason, only one input
context (per application) can have the focus at a time.  The function
XSetICFocus()ID="IX-1002-11-37"XSetICFocus
causes key events to be directed to a particular IC.
It should be called at least once by every application
that uses input contexts.  In addition, the application
should set the FocusWindow attribute of the IC
to the window in which the key events will occur.ID="IX-1002-11-38"multiple windowsand input focusID="IX-1002-11-39"windowsmultiple, and input focusID="IX-1002-11-40"FocusWindow
If an application has multiple text entry windows using
multiple input contexts, that application will have to
call XSetICFocus() every time the input focus
changes.  An application that shares a single IC among
multiple text entry windows will have to set the
FocusWindow attribute of that IC each time the
focus changes.  Note that focus changes can be changes
of the focus window known to the X server, or they can
be application-internal focus changes, controlled by
event redirection as is done in Xt and other toolkits.ID="S2-1002-11-6"Preedit and Status Area Geometry ManagementID="IX-1002-11-41"Preeditgeometry managementID="IX-1002-11-42"geometrymanagementID="IX-1002-11-43"geometrymanagementID="IX-1002-11-44"Status areageometry managementDepending on interaction style, an input method may
require screen space to display pre-edit and status
information.  The application is responsible for
providing these areas, but except for the on-the-spot
interaction style, the input method will handle all
output to them.  When an input method requires screen
space, the application should query its desired size
and attempt to honor it.  Note however that the input
method must make do with whatever area it is given.
This geometry management and geometry negotiation is
handled through attributes of each input context and
with a "geometry callback" function.  These are
described in Sections 11.7 and 11.8.1.ID="S2-1002-11-7"Preedit and Status CallbacksID="IX-1002-11-45"Status area callbacksID="IX-1002-11-46"IMinput methodsWhen using the on-the-spot interaction style, the IM will
request the application to display pre-edit and status
information for it.  This is more complicated for the
application, but because the application has finer
control over the positioning of the information, it
allows the appearance of a seamless interface with
the IM.  The IM makes requests of the application
through a series of
callback functions specified as attributes
of the IC.  The prototypes and responsibilities of
these functions will be described in LINKEND="S1-1002-11-8"Section 11.8, "Geometry, Preedit, and Status Callbacks."ID="S2-1002-11-8"Getting Composed InputID="IX-1002-11-47"composed textID="IX-1002-11-48"XmbLookupStringID="IX-1002-11-49"XwcLookupStringID="IX-1002-11-50"XLookupStringWhen the application gets a KeyPress event, it should
use that event in a call to XmbLookupString() or
XwcLookupString().  These functions are analogs
of XLookupString(), but return multi-byte or
wide-character strings in the codeset of the locale, where
XLookupString() can only return Latin-1 strings.
Because it may take multiple keystrokes to enter a
single character of text, these functions may return a
status code that indicates that no composed input is
ready.Some input methods intercept keyboard events before the
application has a chance to see them.  If this is the
case, they will send a synthetic KeyPress event with a
keycode of 0 when there is composed input that should
be looked up by the application.ID="S2-1002-11-9"Filtering EventsID="IX-1002-11-51"filtering eventsID="IX-1002-11-52"eventsfilteringIn order for an input method to perform pre-editing of input, it
must have access to all KeyPress events.  These events
are passed to it through one of the internationalized
LookupString functions.  All but the
most simple input methods, however, need access to other
events as well.  An IM that
displays graphical feedback to the user will have to
receive expose events, and an IM that displays a menu
of homonyms, for example, will need to receive mouse
motion and button events.
XFilterEvent() provides the hook that makes this
possible.  This function must be called from within an
application's event loop before each new event is
processed.  If the IM has registered a (Xlib-internal) filter for that
event, XFilterEvent() invokes the filter and
the IM has a chance to examine the event.
If the IM is interested in the event,
XFilterEvent() will
return True, and the application should not
dispatch the event any further.
Notice that an IM can
use XFilterEvent() to filter KeyPress events
before the application can call one of the
LookupString functions, but this is not the
primary purpose of the function.It is not safe to assume that the IM will only need
events that the application currently receives,
so the IM places an event mask for events in which it
is interested in an attribute of each IC.  The
application is responsible for requesting to receive
those events in the window of the IC.ID="S2-1002-11-10"The Big PictureWith the above explanations in mind, we can now
consider the saga of a keystroke as it is processed
through an internationalized application.

diagrams the path a character follows
between being typed on the keyboard and being displayed
on the screen in an internationalized application.ID="FG-1002-11-2"How a keystroke becomes a displayed character in an internationalized applicationFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.11.02.gif" ID="GC-1002-11-2"NUMERATION="ARABIC"When the user strikes a key on the keyboard, the
keyboard sends a hardware-specific keycode to the X
server.The X server sends an event to the
client or clients that have expressed interest in keystroke
events for the window that had focus when the keystroke
occurred.The keystroke event will be
received in the client's event loop by a call to
XNextEvent().The event is
immediately passed to XFilterEvent() to give the
input method the opportunity to use it.  Generally, the
input method will not filter a KeyPress event.Back in the application, if XFilterEvent()
returns True, then the application will discard
the event and wait for the next one.Otherwise, the application will go ahead and process
the event.  For every KeyPress event, the
application will call XmbLookupString() or
XwcLookupString().The input method now processes the keystroke:  it adds
a new character to its pre-edit text and updates the
display in the Preedit and Status areas of the
application.  If the keystroke is a control character
such as Delete, the input method may modify the
pre-edit text.If the keystroke indicates that the user is done
pre-editing and wishes to compose the pre-edited text,
the input method does any necessary translation and the
result becomes the return value of
Xmb/XwcLookupString().  In most applications, this
returned string will be immediately echoed in the
window with a call to one of the internationalized text
drawing functions.  If the keystroke merely
adds to the pre-edit text, then the status value
returned by Xmb/wcLookupString() indicates that
there is no composed text ready.The above sections have presented an overview of the
XIM architecture.  The sections below describe how to
write programs with input methods and input contexts.
They explain how to implement each of the steps in the
"big picture" above.ID="S1-1002-11-3"XIM Programming InterfaceID="IX-1002-11-53" SPAN="START"XIMprogramming interfaceThe input method programming interface departs in some
ways from the style established by the rest of Xlib.
Functions that set, modify, or query the attributes of
an XIM or XIC have a variable-length
argument list interface,
similar to the interface of the X Toolkit
XtVaSetValues function, for example.
Attributes are specified by a null-terminated list of
name/value pairs.  Names are null-terminated character
strings (of type char *), and values are of
type XPointer, which is a new Xlib generic
pointer type, like XtPointer, which replaces
the non-standard caddr_t.  There are
predefined symbols for all of the XIM and
XIC attribute names.  These are named similarly
to X Toolkit resource names:  they are prefixed with
XN (not XtN) and words in the name
are separated by capitalization rather than
underscores.  They differ from the Xt convention in
that the first letter after the XN prefix
is capitalized.
LINKEND="EX-1002-11-1"Example 11-1
shows this naming
convention and the varargs interface used in C code.
There is only a single defined XIM attribute,
which is explained in LINKEND="S2-1002-11-12"Section 11.4.2, "Querying Input Method Values."  There are
a number of XIC attributes, which are explained
in LINKEND="S1-1002-11-6"Section 11.6, "Input Context Attributes."ID="EX-1002-11-1"The XIM varargs interface and attribute naming conventionsstatus = XSetICValues(ic, XNFocusWindow, w,

input context have a number of sub-attributes.  In order to
set or query these values, the programmer must specify
a nested argument list of type XVaNestedList*.
A value of this type is created with a call to the
function XVaCreateNestedList().  This function
takes a dummy integer argument (as required by ANSI-C)
followed by a null-terminated variable length list of
name/value pairs.  XVaCreateNestedList() can be
conveniently called from within an argument list to
another function, as is shown in

XFree(nlist);ID="IX-1002-11-54"XNVaNestedListID="IX-1002-11-55"nestedargument listsNested argument lists can also be used to specify
top-level attributes.  To do this, use the special
name XNVaNestedList which will cause the
contents of the following nested list to be logically
inserted into the argument list at the current
position.Note that XVaCreateNestedList() allocates memory
for the list it returns, which must be freed with a
call to XFree().  Also note that if any of the
values in the list are pointer types, the data pointed
to must remain valid for the lifetime of the list.The designers of the XIM specification chose this
varargs-and-named-attributes interface over the more
familiar structure-and-flags interface used by
XChangeWindowAttributes() and XChangeGC(),
for example, because they felt it provided "more
flexibility."  The perceived flexibility to the
programmer is probably a matter of personal taste, but
the varargs interface certainly provides more
flexibility for future extensions--new attributes and
vendor- or IM-specific attributes can
easily be added without destroying binary compatibility.

handle to the input method.  Because input methods are
generally implemented as separate processes, we
generally talk about "opening," not "creating," an input
method.  In this respect, an XIM can be thought
of as analogous to a Display *.  The sections
below explain how to open and close a connection to an
input method, and how to query the values of input
method attributes.ID="S2-1002-11-11"Opening and Closing an Input MethodID="IX-1002-11-58"input methodsopeningID="IX-1002-11-59"input methodsclosingID="IX-1002-11-60"XOpenIMA connection to an input method is opened with a call
to XOpenIM().  This function takes as arguments
the Display, an XrmDatabase(), and a resource
name and resource class of type char *.  The
database is used by the input method to look up
resources private to it.  The resource name and class
are used as resource name and class prefixes by the
input method when looking up resources for input
contexts.  In an Xt program, the database created when
the display is initialized can be used.  In Xlib
programs, the programmer will have to explicitly build the
database, or simply pass an empty one.XOpenIM() also uses the current locale and locale
modifiers as implicit arguments.  The locale determines
the default input method that XOpenIM() will
connect to, as well as the encoding of the strings
which will be returned by Xmb/XwcLookupString().
The locale is bound to an input method when it is
open--the locale that was in effect when the input
method was opened will be used by all input contexts of
that input method regardless of the current locale when
they are created.The locale determines a default input method to be
opened by XOpenIM(), but it cannot be assumed that only
one input method will be available in each locale.
Therefore X defines a locale modifier named "im" which

XSetICValues() and can be queried with a call
to XGetICValues().  Both functions take an
XIC as their first argument, followed by a
NULL-terminated variable-length argument list
of attribute name/attribute value pairs.  The names,
types, and usage of the attributes are explained in
LINKEND="S1-1002-11-6"Section 11.6, "Input Context Attributes."  Note that some of the attributes
are read-only, some must be specified when the IC is
created, and
others must be specified once and may not
be changed once specified.LINKEND="FN-1002-11-2"ID="FN-1002-11-2"Some attributes, such as XNGeometryCallback and
XNArea, have values that are pointer types.  The spec
does not say whether the values pointed to by these
attributes are copied.  It appears that the Xsi
implementation (the default) does make a copy of all
these attribute values, with the exception of the
XNResourceName and XNResourceClass
attributes, which are strings and not of fixed
length.The value arguments passed to XGetICValues() must
be valid pointers to locations in which to store the
requested attribute values.  XGetICValues() will
allocate memory for the storage of some of these
attributes,
and this memory must be freed by the client with a call
to XFree().LINKEND="FN-1002-11-3"ID="FN-1002-11-3"The R5 spec is self-contradictory about which attributes
will have memory allocated for them.  It says, "Each
argument value (following a name) must point to a
location where the value is to be stored.
XGetICValues() allocates memory to store the
values, and client [sic] is responsible for freeing each
value by calling XFree()."  The first sentence
indicates that the program provides memory for the
attribute value.  The second indicates that the
program provides memory for a pointer to the attribute
value.  The Xsi implementation (the default) takes the
first approach, and the Ximp implementation takes the
second.  So, for example, to query the value of the
XNFocusWindow attribute, you would pass the
address of a Window to XGetICValues() if
using the Xsi implementation, but the address of a
Window * if using the Ximp implementation.  In
the second case, the returned Window * value
points to allocated memory which must be freed.  When
querying attributes like XNResourceName and
XNGeometryCallback, which have values that are
pointer types, it is not clear what types should be
passed in the query, nor is it clear whether the
returned pointer points to a copy of the value which
must be freed, or to the value itself which must not be
freed.  As a programmer, your best bet is to avoid the
use of XGetICValues(), except when necessary for
the XNFilterEvents and XNAreaNeeded attributes.ID="IX-1002-11-100"Preeditsub-attributes, queryingID="IX-1002-11-101"Status areasub-attributes, querying
To query the values of Preedit and Status
sub-attributes, create a nested list of name/value
pairs, where the values are pointers to storage and
pass this nested list as the value of the
XNPreeditAttributes or
XNStatusAttributes attributes.  You cannot
query the value of all sub-attributes by passing a
XVaNestedList* as the value of
XNPreeditAttributes or
XNStatusAttributes--XGetICValues() does
not build and return a nested list of sub-attributesBoth XSetICValues() and XGetICValues()
return a char * which is NULL if no
errors occurred, or points to the name of the first
attribute that could not be set or queried.ID="S2-1002-11-16"Resetting an Input ContextID="IX-1002-11-102"input contextsresettingID="IX-1002-11-103"XmbResetICID="IX-1002-11-104"XwcResetICIf text input is interrupted while pre-editing is in
progress, the input context may be left in a
non-initial internal state.  To reset the state of an
XIC, call XmbResetIC() or
XwcResetIC.  Both reset the IC to its initial
state and discard any pending input.  Both functions
may return the current pre-edit string, but it is
implementation dependent how and whether they do this.
The only difference between these functions is in the
type of string they return.  The returned string, if
any, should be freed by the client with XFree().ID="S2-1002-11-17"Setting Input Context FocusID="IX-1002-11-105"input contextsfocusWhen the focus window of an input context receives the
application input focus, the application should call
XSetICFocus() on that IC.  Use
XUnsetICFocus() when the focus window of an IC
loses focus, or simply call XSetICFocus() on the
IC of the new focus window.  This will allow the input
method to perform internal housekeeping and display
special graphics (such as a highlighted border) in the
Pre-Edit and Status windows of the IC that has the
focus.If you are using a single IC to handle input across
several windows, and the input focus shifts from one of
these windows to another, then the IC's
XNFocusWindow attribute should be changed, you
needn't call XSetICFocus().  Depending upon your
user interface, you may also want to reset the IC when
focus changes like this.ID="S2-1002-11-18"Input Context Utility FunctionsID="IX-1002-11-106"input contextsutility functionsID="IX-1002-11-107"functionsinput contextThe following utility functions are sometimes useful

of input is controlled by the attributes of the input
context of that stream.  There is an attribute, for example, that
specifies the interaction style (which must be one of the
styles supported by the IM), there  are attributes that
specify the pre-edit callbacks to be called by the
input method when over-the-spot interaction is being
used, and there are attributes that specify the
foreground and background pixels and colormap for the
IM to use when drawing in its Preedit area.Some attributes are used for communication in the other
direction.  One is used by the input method to tell the
client which types of X events it requires, and
another is used by the input method to request a new
size for its Preedit and Status areas.  Most attributes
may be freely modified, but note that some must be set
when the IC is created, others must be set exactly
once, and others still are read-only and must never be set.The attributes are listed below.  Most attributes
provide default values, but recall that some must be
specified, either when the IC is created or at some
later time before it is used.
ID="IX-1002-11-116"XNInputStyleID="S2-1002-11-19"XNInputStyleThe XNInputStyle attribute specifies the interaction style to be
used by the input method for this input context.  It is of type
XIMStyle.  It
must be one of the supported styles queried from the
input method with XGetIMValues().  This attribute
must be specified when the IC is created.  It may be
queried but not changed.
ID="IX-1002-11-117"input contextsand windowsID="IX-1002-11-118"XNClientWindowID="S2-1002-11-20"XNClientWindowThe XNClientWindow attribute specifies the window in which the input
method will display its Preedit and Status areas.  It is of type
Window.  All
geometry values for those areas are specified relative
to this window.  This
attribute must be specified (with XCreateIC() or
XSetICValues()) before any input is done, and
once set may not be changed.
ID="IX-1002-11-119"XNFocusWindowID="S2-1002-11-21"XNFocusWindowIf a single IC is used to handle multiple input streams
within a single client window (as in a multi-buffer
text editor that displays several paned editing windows
and provides pre-editing in a message line at the
bottom of the client window), the XNFocusWindow
attribute (of type Window)
is used to specify which sub-window currently
has the focus.  The input method may select events on
this window, send synthetic events to it, set
or change properties on it, or grab the
keyboard within it.
If not specified, this attribute will
default to the value of XNClientWindow.  If this
attribute is specified, it should generally be a child
of the client window.  The value of XNFocusWindow
may be changed freely.
ID="IX-1002-11-120"XNResourceNameID="IX-1002-11-121"XNResourceClassID="S2-1002-11-22"XNResourceName and XNResourceClassThe XNResourceName and XNResourceClass
attributes are null-terminated strings which completely specify
the resource name and class used to obtain resources for the
client window.  If the input method allows per-IC
customization using X resources, those resources will
be looked up using the name and
class hierarchies specified by XNResourceName
and XNResourceClass.  If your application is
named "iedit" with class name "Iedit," and the client
window is a widget named "itext" of class "IText"and it is within a top-level manager widget named
"main" of class "Form," then the XNResourceName
attribute should be set to "iedit.main.itext," and the
XNResourceClass attribute should be set to
"IEdit.Form.IText."If these attributes
are not set, the input method will not be able to
look up resource values for the IC in its resource
database.
Both attributes may be set at any time, but
because resource lookup is generally done only when an IC is created,
they will only be useful if specified to
XCreateIC().  The specification does not say
whether or not the values of these strings are copied.
To be safe, the strings passed as values of
XNResourceName and XNResourceClass
should not be freed or modified until the IC is
destroyed or new values are provided for those
attributes.
ID="IX-1002-11-122"XNGeometryCallbackID="S2-1002-11-23"XNGeometryCallbackID="IX-1002-11-123"input methodsgeometryThe XNGeometryCallback attribute, of type
XIMCallback*, specifies
a procedure which an input method may call to request
a different size for it's Preedit or Status areas.
Because the client is never obliged to meet IM geometry
requests, specifying this attribute is optional.
ID="IX-1002-11-124"event maskXNFilterEventsID="IX-1002-11-125"XNFilterEventsID="S2-1002-11-24"XNFilterEventsThe XNFilterEvents attribute is used by the input method to notify
the client of the X events it needs to receive.  It is
an event mask, a long integer of the format passed to
XSelectInput().  The client must query this
resource before any input is done and augment the
event mask for the XNClientWindow with it.  This attribute is read-only
and should never be set.

sub-attributes that control the position, behavior, and
appearance of the Preedit and Status areas of the IC.
They have type XVaNestedList and should be
created with a call to XVaCreateNestedList().
Most of these attributes are used by the input method
for both the Preedit and the Status areas.  They are
ignored, of course, for XIMPreeditNone and
XIMStatusNone interaction styles.  All of these
attributes except the callbacks are ignored for
interaction styles XIMPreeditCallbacks and
XIMStatusCallbacks.  They are described individually
below.ID="S3-1002-11-1"XNAreaID="IX-1002-11-131"XNAreaID="IX-1002-11-132"Xrm functionsstring encoding and locale changesID="IX-1002-11-133"rectanglesinput context attributesThe XNArea attribute is a pointer to an XRectangle.
If the interaction style is XIMPreeditArea or
XIMStatusArea, then the rectangle defines the
region of the client window in which pre-editing and
status display is to take place.  An input method may
create sub-windows of the client window that conform to
this geometry.  If the pre-edit interaction style is
XIMPreeditPosition instead of
XIMPreeditArea, then this attribute specifies a
clipping region in the focus window of the IC to be
used in conjunction with the XNSpotLocation
attribute to implement over-the-spot pre-editing.  This
attribute must be specified if any of the above
interaction styles are in use.  For all other pre-edit
and status interaction styles, this attribute is
ignored.

XRectangle.  It is used for geometry
negotiation between client and input method for the
XIMPreeditArea and XIMStatusArea
interaction styles, and is ignored for all other
styles.  The client may provide a hint to the input
method about the area it is likely to get by setting
a non-zero width or height in this attribute (the x
and y values are ignored).  The client may query the
input method's preferred size for those areas by reading
the value of this attribute.  A well-behaved input
method will not request a size larger than any hints it
has received.  Note that neither step is required--the
client can always set any size it desires with the
XNArea attribute.  See LINKEND="S1-1002-11-7"Section 11.7, "Negotiating Preedit and Status Area Geometries" for
more details on geometry negotiation.

XPoint.  It is used
when the Preedit interaction style is
XIMPreeditPosition and is ignored for all
Status interaction styles and all other Preedit
interaction styles.  The value of this attribute should
be set to the position (in the focus window) at which
the next character would be drawn.  The input method
will use this point and the clipping region specified
in XNAreaNeeded to implement over-the-spot
pre-editing in a sub-window of the focus window.  Each
time a newly-composed character is drawn or the text
modified in any way, the value of this attribute should
be changed to reflect the new value of the "spot."When the interaction style is
XIMPreeditPosition, this attribute must be
specified when the IC is created.

flexible applications will want to query the input
method for its desired size.  To allow this, a protocol
for geometry negotiation between application and input
method has been defined.  The protocol uses the
ID="IX-1002-11-176"XNAreaNeededXNAreaNeeded sub-attribute of an input context
in two distinct ways: when the application sets this
attribute with a non-zero width and/or height, the
input method interprets these as hints
about the size that will eventually be assigned to it
by the client.  When the application queries the value
of the XNAreaNeeded attribute, it is returned
the input method's preferred size which it may choose to
honor when setting the size in the XNArea
attribute.An example best demonstrates the use of this protocol:
Suppose an
internationalized client wants to place the pre-edit
area across the bottom of its application window.  This
means that the width of the area is constrained to be
the width of the window, but the height of the area is
not constrained.  So the application specifies
the width of the XNAreaNeeded attribute to be
the width of the window and leaves the height of the
attribute set to 0.  Now the input method may use
this information to re-compute its desired size.  If it
would have liked a one line pre-edit area 500 pixels
wide, for example, and has just received a hint that it
will not get an area wider than 350 pixels, it might
choose to request a pre-edit area that is two lines
high.  Now when the application queries the
XNAreaNeeded attribute it will get the input
method's new desired size.  If an application has
no constraints for the input method, it can omit the
first step and simply read from XNAreaNeeded.This negotiation protocol is not reserved for
application startup; it may take place at any time.
Note that if the application changes the
XNFocusWindow attribute of an IC or the
XNFontSet or XNLineSpacing
sub-attributes of the pre-edit or status areas, the
input method will probably have a new desired size for
those areas, and the application should redo the
geometry negotiation process.
When the application's window is resized, the application
will probably want to place the pre-edit and status areas
at a new location, and may also have new constraints on
their size.
The application should
set its size constraints in XNAreaNeeded even
if those constraints have not changed since the last
time geometry was negotiated.  LINKEND="FN-1002-11-6"ID="FN-1002-11-6"The R5 spec makes no statement about the duration of the
validity of the application's constraints.LINKEND="EX-1002-11-6"Example 11-6

}Finally, an application may choose to provide a
callback procedure that will be called by the input
method to request a new size for its pre-edit or status
areas.  This callback may be triggered by changes to
attributes such as XNFontSet as described
above, or may be triggered directly by the user's
interactions with the input method (an input method
could provide "resize handles" on its pre-edit area,
for example).  If an application provides a geometry
callback, it should attempt to honor any resize
requests made by the input method.  (An input method
might choose whether or not to display "resize handles"on its pre-edit area depending on the presence or
absence of such a callback.)  The prototype geometry
callback is described in LINKEND="S2-1002-11-26"Section 11.8.1, "The Geometry Callback."ID="IX-1002-11-177" SPAN="END"negotiating geometriesID="IX-1002-11-178" SPAN="END"Preeditgeometry managementID="IX-1002-11-179" SPAN="END"Status areanegotiating geometriesID="S1-1002-11-8"Geometry, Preedit, and Status CallbacksID="IX-1002-11-180"callbacksgeometryID="IX-1002-11-181"callbacksPreeditID="IX-1002-11-182"callbacksStatusID="IX-1002-11-183"geometrycallbacksID="IX-1002-11-184"PreeditcallbacksID="IX-1002-11-185"Status areacallbacksID="IX-1002-11-186"XIMCallbackAn application interacting with an input method using
the XIMPreeditArea and/or XIMStatusArea styles may
optionally provide a callback to be called when the
input method would like to renegotiate the size of its
pre-edit or status areas.  An application using the
XIMPreeditCallbacks style must provide a suite of
pre-edit callback routines that allow the input method
and application to cooperate and provide pre-editing
that appears to be an integral part of the application
itself.  Similarly, an application using the
XIMStatusCallbacks must provide a suite of callbacks
for the display of status information.Each callback attribute is of type XIMCallback,
which is shown in
LINKEND="EX-1002-11-7"Example 11-7.ID="EX-1002-11-7"The XIMCallback structuretypedef void (*XIMProc)();
typedef struct {
    XPointer client_data;
    XIMProc callback;
} XIMCallback;ID="IX-1002-11-187"client_dataIf you have used X Toolkit callbacks,
you will be familiar with the use of the
client_data field.  This is untyped data
registered with the callback and passed to the callback
every time it is invoked.  When a single callback
procedure is registered on several different callback
attributes, the client_data can serve in a
switch statment to determine how the callback
should behave.  It is also often used to pass data to
the callback (such as a window ID or a widget pointer),
which the callback would otherwise not have access to.
The type of client_data is XPointer,
which is a new Xlib generic pointer type, like
XtPointer.Most of the callback procedures have the prototype shown in
LINKEND="EX-1002-11-8"Example 11-8.ID="EX-1002-11-8"A prototype XIM callback procedurevoid CallbackPrototype(ic, client_data, call_data)
    XIC ic;
    XPointer client_data;
    XPointer call_data;The XIC passed to the callback procedure will
be the input context that caused the callback to be invoked.
The client_data argument will be the untyped
data registered with the callback as described above.
It is up to the callback to know the actual type of
this data and cast it as appropriate before use.  The
call_data argument is data passed by the input
method to the callback; it is the data required by the
callback to perform whatever action the input method
needs done.  Each callback passes a different type in
this argument.
Note that the Xlib header files do not
actually define CallbackPrototype, only the
type XIMProc shown in the previous example.
Since the definition of the XIMProc type does
not have a prototype, callback procedures may be
written with any desired types for client_data
and call_data.ID="S2-1002-11-26"The Geometry CallbackID="IX-1002-11-188"geometrycallbacksID="IX-1002-11-189"callbacksgeometryID="IX-1002-11-190"XNGeometryCallbackThe geometry callback (XNGeometryCallback) is triggered
when the input method would like to renegotiate the
geometry of its pre-edit or status areas.  It is not
passed any data in its call_data argument.
Note that this callback does not indicate whether the
input method wants renegotiation of the pre-edit area
or the status area or both.  If the application and the
input method are interacting through both
XIMPreeditArea and XIMStatusArea
styles, then the application should renegotiate the
geometry of both areas.  The geometry negotiation
process is described in LINKEND="S1-1002-11-7"Section 11.7, "Negotiating Preedit and Status Area Geometries."ID="S2-1002-11-27"The PreeditStartCallback and the PreeditEndCallbackID="IX-1002-11-191"PreeditcallbacksID="IX-1002-11-192"XNPreeditStartCallbackID="IX-1002-11-193"XNPreeditEndCallbackID="IX-1002-11-194"callbacksPreeditThe XNPreeditStartCallback and
XNPreeditEndCallback are called when the input
method begins and ends pre-editing.  They give the
application the opportunity to do any necessary
internal setup or cleanup and provide graphical
feedback to the user that the application is entering
or leaving pre-edit mode.  Both callbacks are passed
NULL as their call_data values.
XNPreeditStartCallback will not be called twice
for the same IC without an intervening call to
XNPreeditEndCallback.The XNPreeditStartCallback has one additional
requirement.  It must return an int (and
therefore does not satisfy the general callback
prototype given above) to the input method which
indicates the maximum number of bytes
the application is able to handle in the pre-edit
string.  If this callback returns a positive value, the
input method should not expect the application to be
able to successfully display pre-edit strings any longer
than that value.  If the callback returns the value -1,
it indicates that the application can handle pre-edit
strings of any length.ID="S2-1002-11-28"The PreeditDrawCallbackID="IX-1002-11-195"XNPreeditDrawCallbackID="IX-1002-11-196"input methodsediting the pre-edit stringID="IX-1002-11-197"pre-edit stringeditingThis callback is called when the input method wants the
application to insert, delete, or replace text in the
pre-edit string.  It is also used by the input method
to request that some characters or substrings be
highlighted (to indicate a selected region of the
pre-edit string, for example).  The callback is
expected to display the pre-edit text to the user and
will have to maintain an internal pre-edit string.  The
pre-edit text will likely appear within the running
text of the application, but cursor and character
positions referred to in this callback are all relative
to the beginning of the pre-edit string.  The
XNPreeditDrawCallback is passed call_data
of type XIMPreeditDrawCallbackStruct, which is
shown in

Note that manipulations of the pre-edit string are always
done on the basis of character positions, so it will generally be
most useful to store the pre-edit string in
wide-character format.If the text field is non-NULL, and
text.string is non-NULL, the application must
insert that string at the position specified by
chg_first.  A position of 0 indicates that the
string should be inserted before the first character of
the pre-edit string, a position of 1 indicates that the
string should be inserted before the second character of
the pre-edit string, and so on.
If text.encoding_is_wchar is TRUE then
the string to be inserted is the wide-character string
text.string.wide_char which is
text.length characters long.  If FALSE,
then the string to be inserted is the multi-byte string
text.string.multi_byte, which is also
text.length characters (not bytes) long.
Since there is no way to request that the IM use either
wide-character or multi-byte strings, your application
will have to be prepared to handle either case.  When
passed a multi-byte string, it will probably be easiest
to convert it to a wide-character string and operate on
it in that representation.If there is a string to be inserted, and

text, and there is no specified way for the IM to
request the application to convert pixel locations to

the callback must display the text described by

XIMText type is also used by the
XNPreeditDrawCallback, and is shown and explained
in LINKEND="S2-1002-11-28"Section 11.8.3, "The PreeditDrawCallback."  The text may be in multi-byte or
wide-character form, so the application must be able to
handle either case.  Recall that the length
field of the XIMText structure gives the number
of characters of text, even when the text is in
multi-byte form.  The length in bytes of a
multi-byte string is required for a call to
XmbDrawImageString(), so when text is passed in
multi-byte form, the application will have to use
strlen to determine its length before
displaying it.If the type field is XIMBitmapType,
then the callback must display the 1-bit deep
Pixmapdata.bitmap.  LINKEND="FN-1002-11-10"ID="FN-1002-11-10"The R5 spec does not say anything about the depth of this
Pixmap.
Notice that the callback does not
return the width or height of the pixmap, so
these must be obtained with a call to
XGetGeometry() before the pixmap is displayed.The XIMStatusCallbacks interaction style does
not allow for any communication between the application
and the input method about the maximum size of the
status area.  Since it can always be passed data to
display that is larger than the area it has allocated,
the XNStatusDrawCallback must be prepared either
to clip or provide scrolling for the strings and
pixmaps it is passed, or to attempt to enlarge the
status area.  Resizing the status area requires the
main application window to be made larger or other
windows to be rearranged or resized.  The
XIMStatusCallbacks interaction style can be
useful for an application designed to be used with a
single input method which calls the
XNStatusDrawCallback with well specified values.
In general, however, when you don't know what
sort of data your application will be asked to display
(or the meaning of that data), you won't be able to do
anything beyond displaying the data in some rectangular
region of your application, which amounts to the same
thing as the XIMStatusArea interaction style.
So in these cases it may make more sense to use
XIMStatusArea if the input method supports it.ID="S1-1002-11-9"Filtering EventsID="IX-1002-11-228" SPAN="START"filtering eventsID="IX-1002-11-229" SPAN="START"eventsfilteringAn input method needs to receive X events other than
keystrokes.  It must receive expose events when its
Preedit or Status areas need refreshing, it needs mouse
button events if it is to support full-featured editing
of pre-edit text, and it needs mouse motion events if
it implements popup menus.  The input method needs to
get first crack at these events, but will not always be
able to intercept them directly from the server, so the
application is responsible for passing all events to
the input method before processing them itself.
This is done with the function XFilterEvent().
It should be called from the event loop of all
internationalized applications, generally right after
XNextEvent().  XFilterEvent() takes two
arguments, the event to filter, and the window to which
the event is directed.  If the application (or a
toolkit used by the application) performs event
redirection, this window may not be the same as the
window in which the event occurred.  If the window
argument is None, the window of the event will
be used.  An application cannot know in advance which
events the IM will need to filter; it must pass all
events to XFilterEvent().  If
XFilterEvent() returns True, it
filtered the event the application should
dispatch the event no further.Remember that an input method may be interested in
different types of events than the application is.  If
the application is to pass events to the input method
through XFilterEvent(), the application must
have registered interest in receiving those
events with XSelectInput().  The XNFilterEvents
input context attribute contains a mask of events
that the input method is interested in receiving, and
all clients should read this attribute and use it when
selecting events.

convert the keycode returned in a KeyPress event into a
KeySym and further into a character string that could
be passed to the X text drawing functions.
Unfortunately, this function only works for the
Latin-1 charset.  To support internationalization in a
limited way, there were alternate LookupString
functions in the Xmu library:
XmuLookupLatin2(), XmuLookupJISX0201(),
XmuLookupGreek(), etc.  In R5, these

have been superseded by XmbLookupString() and
XwcLookupString().  These functions are identical
except in the type of string they return:  the
Xmb version returns a multi-byte string of
char, and Xwc version returns a wide-character string of wchar_t.  In both cases the
string will be encoded as appropriate for the locale of
the IC.LINKEND="FN-1002-11-11"ID="FN-1002-11-11"There were bugs in the public R5 version of
the Xsi implementation of XwcLookupString().
It is supposed to return as its value the number of
characters in the returned string, but appears, at
least in some cases, to return the number of bytes
instead.Whenever a KeyPress event is delivered to an
application that is performing internationalized text
input, the application should use that event in a call
to XmbLookupString() or XwcLookupString().
(Note that KeyRelease events should not be passed to
these functions--they will result in undefined
behavior.)  The application should not expect that each
call to Xmb/XwcLookupString() will return a
string.  Depending on the complexity of the input
method in use, a user may type many keystrokes before
any composed input is ready for the application.
Neither should the application expect that
Xmb/XwcLookupString() will return a single
character at a time--in some input methods a user may
type a phrase, a sentence, or more before hitting the
key that triggers the conversion from pre-edit to
composed text.XmbLookupString() and XwcLookupString()
take as arguments the IC for which
input is to be looked up (which is usually the IC with
the focus), the X event that triggered
the call, a buffer to return the multi-byte or wide-character string in, a pointer to a location to return
a keysym, and a pointer to a location to return a
status value.  The value returned by both functions is
an integer which specifies the number of bytes in the
returned multi-byte string or the number of
wchar_t in the returned wide-character string.
There are five status values that these functions
return, each of which may require separate processing:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-11-242"XLookupNoneXLookupNone means that the input method does
not have any composed input ready to pass to the
application, and the application need not do any
further processing on the current key event.  When this
status value is returned, the return value of the
function will be 0.ID="IX-1002-11-243"XLookupKeySymXLookupKeySym means that a keysym, but no
string, has been returned.  This likely means that the
user has struck a special key of some sort (a function
key, an arrow key, Delete, etc.).  The application
should handle the keysym as appropriate.  Because no
string is returned, the return value of the function is
0.  Be careful to capitalize the constant
XLookupKeySym correctly; Xlib also defines
the function XLookupKeysym().ID="IX-1002-11-244"XLookupCharsXLookupChars means that a string, but no
keysym, has been returned.  The multi-byte or wide-character string is encoded in the codeset of the
locale of the IC and is placed in the buffer passed to
the function.  The return value of the function is the
length of the multi-byte string in bytes or the length
of the wide-character string in wide characters.ID="IX-1002-11-245"XLookupBothXLookupBoth means that both a string and a
keysym are returned.  This may indicate that a single
keystroke has passed through the input method without
any pre-editing, as is common in European input
methods, for example.  The return value of the function
is the length of the string, as described for
XLookupChars above.ID="IX-1002-11-246"XBufferOverflowXBufferOverflow means that the string to be
returned will not fit in the provided buffer.  The
return value of the function is the required size of
the buffer (in bytes or wide characters), and nothing
is returned in the string buffers.  The input string
remains in the IC, waiting to be looked up.  The
application should allocate a buffer of the required
size and look up the string, or should display an error
message and flush the pending input with a call to
XmbResetIC() or XwcResetIC.  If this
return status is ignored, the large input string will
remain pending and block any further input on that IC.Some input method architectures allow the input method
to intercept events from the X server before the
application ever sees them.  If these input methods
remove all KeyPress events from the input stream, then
the application will never be triggered to call
Xmb/wcLookupString().  If this is the case, the
input method will send a synthetic KeyPress event to
the application when it has composed input ready for
lookup.  By convention, the keycode in this synthetic
event should be 0.  Note, though, that these are
architectural details and do not affect the structure
of an internationalized applications.LINKEND="EX-1002-11-13"Example 11-13 shows code that uses

}ID="S1-1002-11-11"XIM Programming ChecklistID="IX-1002-11-247"XIMprogramming checklistThe following list provides useful guidelines when
writing an Xlib or Xt application or Xt widget that uses
the R5 internationalized input mechanisms.  It is
followed by an example Xlib program that performs simple
internationalized text input and implements most of the
steps in the list.MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-11-248"localesettingID="IX-1002-11-249"setlocale
Set the locale with setlocale.  Use a locale
name from a resource, or specify the empty string
("").  In an Xt application do this from the
special callback procedure registered with
XtSetLanguageProc().ID="IX-1002-11-250"XSupportsLocaleVerify that X supports the locale with
XSupportsLocale().Set the locale modifiers (i.e., the name of the input
method to use) from a resource or with the empty
string.If you want your input method to be customizable with
resources, create a database or get a handle to an already created
one.  In an Xt application, use XtDatabase().ID="IX-1002-11-251"XOpenIMOpen a connection to the IM of the locale with
XOpenIM().  Pass a
resource database and the name and class the IM should
use for looking up its resources in that database.  Verify that the IM
is successfully opened.  If you are writing a widget,
you can assume that a valid XIM will be passed as a
resource, and skip this step.Query the IM for its supported interaction styles.
Choose one that your application can support based on
the value of user-specified resources, or upon some
criteria for which will provide the best user interface
for your application.  In a widget, this should be in
the initialize method.Create an XFontSet for use by the IC.  The base font
name list for the XFontSet should be obtained from a
resource.  In an Xt application, you should use the
constant XtDefaultFontSet as the default value
for this resource.  If you are writing a widget, you
can assume that a valid XFontSet will be passed as a
resource.Create a Window for use by the IC.
If you are programming with Xt, create a widget.  If
you are writing your own widget, the window will be
created for you by the realize method.ID="IX-1002-11-252"XCreateICCreate an IC with XCreateIC(), specifying the
interaction style you choose, the XNEditWindow,
and the XNFontSet sub-attribute for
both the Preedit and Status Areas.  If you are using the
XIMPreeditPosition style, you must also specify
the XNAreaNeeded attribute, and if you are
using XIMPreeditCallbacks or
XIMStatusCallbacks styles, you must specify
values for all the applicable callback attributes.
You may also
specify any other attributes at this point.  If you are
writing a widget, create the IC in the initialize
method, but specify the window in the realize method.
In a widget, you should provide widget resources which
control the setting of IC attributes like
XNLineSpacing and XNCursor.Query the value of the XNFilterEvents attribute of the
IC and augment the event mask for your window with
those events.  If you are writing an Xt program, call
XtAddEventHandler for the event mask with a
no-op procedure.  If you are writing a widget, call
XtAddEventHandler() in the same way from the
realize method.If you have selected the XIMPreeditArea or the
XIMStatusArea interaction styles, negotiate a
geometry for either or both of those areas using the
XNAreaNeeded attribute of the IC.  Set the
geometry you decide on in the XNArea attribute.
If you are writing a widget, begin the negotiation
in the initialize method, and set the
XNArea attribute when the window is created in the
realize method.  Renegotiate geometry whenever
your application window changes size.If you have selected the XIMPreeditPosition
interaction style, set the initial location of your
insertion cursor in the XNSpotLocation
attribute, and a region within which pre-editing is
allowed in the XNArea resource.
If you are writing a widget, do this in the resize
method.  In a widget, you may want to implement the Preedit
and Status areas as sub-widgets.ID="IX-1002-11-253"XSetICFocusFor a simple application that does no focus
management, set the focus to your IC with
XSetICFocus().  For more complicated
applications, you should set and unset IC focus when
you receive FocusIn and FocusOut events, or whenever
your application-internal or toolkit focus changes.  In
an Xt program or widget, you can use an event handler
or a translation and action to track focus changes.ID="IX-1002-11-254"XFilterEventUse XFilterEvent() in your event loop before dispatching
an event.  If it returns True, discard the
event and wait for another.  In Xt programs,
this is handled for you by XtDispatchEvent()
in XtAppMainLoop().ID="IX-1002-11-255"XmbLookupStringID="IX-1002-11-256"XwcLookupString
When XFilterEvent() returns an unfiltered
KeyPress event, use Xmb/wcLookupString() to
convert it to a KeySym or a string in the encoding of
the locale.  In Xt programs or widgets, use an event
handler or a translation and action to get these events.ID="IX-1002-11-257"XmbDrawStringID="IX-1002-11-258"XwcDrawString
Echo the newly input characters with
Xmb/wcDrawString() or one of the other R5 text
drawing functions.If you are using the XIMPreeditPosition
interaction style, update the values of the
XNSpotLocation and XNArea attributes of
the IC each time you move the insertion cursor.If your application supports the XIMPreeditArea
or XIMStatusArea interaction styles, optionally
write a GeometryCallback procedure to handle
requests from the IM to change the size of those areas.
If you are writing a composite widget, the
GeometryCallback and the geometry_manager
method may be able to share code.If your application supports the
XIMPreeditCallbacks or
XIMStatusCallbacks interaction styles, write
the required callback procedures to support those
styles.LINKEND="EX-1002-11-14"Example 11-14 is the complete code of a program that performs simple
internationalized text input.  Many of the examples in
this chapter and the last are fragments of this program.LINKEND="FN-1002-11-12"ID="FN-1002-11-12"To run this program successfully, you must have an
input method running.  Because there are no input
methods as part of the core R5 distribution, this
may be difficult.  If your Xlib uses the Xsi
implementation of the R5 internationalization
features, you can use the input method in
contrib/im/Xsi.  In order to run this program, I
had to do the following:MARK="BULLET"Build everything in contrib/im/Xsi.Install everything in contrib/im/Xsi.  This
involved installing a number of files under
/usr/local/lib/wnn, and adding a new user "wnn"to the /etc/passwd file.Start the "translation server"contrib/im/Xsi/Wnn/jserver/jserver.Start the "input manager"contrib/im/Xsi/Xwnmo/xwnmo/xwnmo which was also
installed in /usr/bin/X11.Set the XMODIFIERS environment variable to
"@im=_XWNMO."Set the LANG environment variable to something
appropriate, ja_JP.ujis, for example.With these steps accomplished, I was able to run the
program and type Latin characters, but I was never able
to figure out how to actually make use of the input
method to input Japanese.  Since the Xsi input method
is contributed software, it may have been updated since
this program was written, and the above list may no
longer be correct.ID="EX-1002-11-14"Performing internationalized text input: a complete program/*

communication between applications.  There are three:  properties,
selections, and cut buffers, all of which are described in this
chapter.  The special case of communication between an application and
the window manager is also covered here.  Internationalized interclient
communication is described in LINKEND="S1-1002-10-5"Section 10.5, "Internationalized Interclient Communication."
Standard conventions for
additional aspects of interclient communication are covered in
Appendix L of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.ID="IX-1002-12-1" SPAN="START"interclient communicationCommunication is necessary to make sure that all applications
running under X cooperate properly with the window manager and
share the system resources politely.  Communication also allows
applications to interchange data.  Most applications in an
integrated computing environment should have the ability to
transfer data to and accept data from other applications.Communication between clients takes place through properties.
ID="IX-1002-12-2"propertiescommunicating throughID="IX-1002-12-3"communicationthrough properties
Sometimes properties are set directly by one application and read
by another.  This is the case with most communication between the
window manager and the clients.There is also a simple but limited means of communication through
ID="IX-1002-12-4"communicationthrough cut buffersID="IX-1002-12-5"communicationthrough selectionsID="IX-1002-12-6"cut bufferscommunication throughID="IX-1002-12-7"selectionscommunication through
properties called cut buffers.  But the preferred and most
powerful method of general communication between clients is called
selections.  Selections actually establish a dialog between
the two applications, not just a one-way communication.  Both cut
buffers and selections are ways of using properties for communication.Successful communication depends on conventions for the meanings
of the data communicated through properties and selections.  The
ID="IX-1002-12-8"data communication
conventions in this area were established initially in
Release 4, with the adoption as an X Consortium standard of the
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM), which is

The current version of the ICCCM is version 1.Several R3 routines are now obsolete because of new
routines added to Xlib in R4.  This edition describes only
the currently valid interfaces.  The outdated routines formerly used
by applications are XSetStandardProperties(),
XSetWMHints(), XSetZoomHints(),

windows, usually to make that data available to the window manager
or other applications.  Properties are stored in the server.Each property has a unique integer ID, called an atom.  An atom is
just a nickname for a property, so that arbitrary length property
name strings do not have to be transferred back and forth between
Xlib and the server.  The atom is assigned by the server and will
remain defined in the server even after the client that defined it
terminates.  The atoms for the predefined properties are constants
defined in <X11/Xatom.h> all of them begin with the prefix
ID="IX-1002-12-29"Xatom.h include fileID="IX-1002-12-30"include filesXatom.hXA_.  This naming convention avoids name clashes with
user-defined symbols.A property is uniquely identified by an atom and a window.  Therefore,
there may be one property on each window identified by a given atom.
In other words, there can be a XA_WM_NAME property on each
and every window, even though by convention this property is only set
or read on the top-level windows of each application.  A property on
a window takes up space only once it is set.Each property also has a name, which is an ASCII string.  For the
predefined properties, the name is never used in code.  That is why
ID="IX-1002-12-31"predefined propertydefinitionID="IX-1002-12-32"propertiespredefined
we have chosen for this manual to refer to all predefined properties
by their atoms.  But for properties defined by convention between
related clients (not predefined), the property name string is used
so that the applications can determine the correct atom for the
property.  The first client to call XInternAtom() with the
ID="IX-1002-12-33"XInternAtom
property name string as an argument gets a new atom.  Subsequent
clients that call XInternAtom() with the same string will get
the same atom.  After each client has called XInternAtom(),
they use the atom rather than the string to refer to the property.
They use this process because for properties defined by clients,
the actual number used for an atom may differ between invocations
of the server.Once created, an atom remains defined in the server even after the
client that created it has exited.  A server remembers all atoms
that were ever defined since the server started up.  This means that
one client can refer to an atom first interned by another client
even if that other client has already exited.Each property has a type, which itself is a property.  There are several
predefined properties for use as some of the more often needed types.The data associated with a property can be stored as an array of 8-bit
ID="IX-1002-12-34"propertiesformat of
quantities, 16-bit quantities, or 32-bit quantities only.  Properties
can contain structures or raw data, but if one is to contain a structure
of complex type, it must be encoded into one of the three byte formats
by the program before being sent to the server and decoded when read
from the server.  The predefined property types have been carefully
designed to match one of the data formats so that encoding and decoding
are not necessary.Properties remain set until the window to which they are attached is
destroyed, which happens automatically when the client that created
the window exits.  However, properties set on the root window remain
defined even after the client that set them has exited, since the
root window is never destroyed.There are 68 predefined properties for window manager communication,
selections, standard colormaps, and font specifications.  The properties
used for window manager communication and selections are described in
this chapter.  The standard colormap properties are described
ID="IX-1002-12-35"propertiesstandard colormapID="IX-1002-12-36"standard colormapproperties
in LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color," and the font properties are
described in LINKEND="CH-1002-6-1"Chapter 6, "Drawing Graphics and Text."Properties are set with XChangeProperty() and read with
XGetWindowProperty().  Whenever XChangeProperty() is

for text properties that support multiple character sets, such
as multi-lingual text.  It is called the Compound Text Encoding.
As of late 1992, the Compound Text Encoding specification is
printed in Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.The format is based on ISO standards for encoding and combining
character sets.  Compound Text is intended to be used in three main
contexts: inter-client communication using selections; window
properties (e.g., window manager hints); and
ID="IX-1002-12-44"internationalizationwindow manager hintsID="IX-1002-12-45"internationalizationresources
resources (e.g., as defined in Xlib and the Xt Intrinsics).
All of the standard routines for setting window manager hints
that set text properties support the compound text encoding.  If you
are only concerned with your program operating in English on a system
where the window manager also uses English, these routines are easy
to use.The target type for selections in the Compound Text encoding
is COMPOUND_TEXT.

demands for screen space and colormaps, the clients being managed must
adhere to certain conventions.  These conventions specify things that
clients must do, things they should or can do if desired, and things
that they must not do.  The most basic thing clients are expected to do
is to set certain properties so that the window manager has information
on which to base its decisions.It is a fundamental principle of client-window manager communication
that a general client should not care which window manager is running or,
indeed, if one is running at all.  The choice of window manager is up to
the user or perhaps the system administrator, not the client.ID="IX-1002-12-49"hintsThe fact that window managers need information about the clients
they are managing and yet that window managers vary and might
not be running lead to the concept of the hint.  A hint
is a suggestion to the window manager about a preference of the
application made by setting a property.  Xlib makes this easy
by providing routines that conveniently set the right properties.
The window manager is encouraged to honor as many of the hints as
possible, but it is not required to honor any of them.  Therefore,
the application must not depend on its hints being honored; it
must be capable of operating when any of its hints are ignored
or denied.LINKEND="FN-1002-12-1"ID="FN-1002-12-1"Applications that create their own colormap are the only
ones that will not be able to run without a window manager if they
honor the conventions, because the window manager is responsible
for installing the colormap.In general, the object of the X11 design is that clients should, as
far as possible, do exactly what they would do in the absence of a
window manager, except for:MARK="BULLET"Hinting to the window manager about the screen space and
colormaps they would like to use.Cooperating with the window manager by accepting the
resources they are allocated, even if not those requested.Being prepared for hardware-limited resource allocations to

Clients create one or more windows that are children of the root
window.  All these windows are known as top-level windows.  It is
these windows that the window manager controls, and it is also these
windows on which the application sets window manager hint properties.ID="S2-1002-12-1"Standard Properties for Window ManagerID="IX-1002-12-53" SPAN="START"standard propertiesfor window managerID="IX-1002-12-54"propertiesset for window managerID="IX-1002-12-55"clientpropertiesOnce the client has created one or more top-level windows but before
it maps them, it must place properties on those windows to help the
window manager manage them effectively.  The following sections
describe each property that must or should be set and how to set it.It is important to remember that the version 1
conventions are the accepted X Consortium standard
and will continue to be valid in R5 and later; there will be additions
but not incompatible changes.Some of the properties that a client sets for the window manager
are mandatory (the standard properties), and some are optional.
ID="IX-1002-12-56"standard propertiesID="IX-1002-12-57"propertiesstandardXSetWMProperties()ID="IX-1002-12-58"XSetWMProperties
which was introduced and used in basicwin
in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," sets all the required properties.  The
purpose of XSetWMProperties()
is to provide a simple interface for the programmer who wants to code
an application quickly.  Other functions are provided to communicate
more optional information to the window manager.In order to work well with most window managers, every program should
call XSetWMProperties() for each top-level window.  These
provide the window manager with the following information:MARK="BULLET"Name of the application for titlebar.Name string for the icon.Command and arguments used to invoke the program.Icon pixmap and mask or window.Preferred initial icon position.Size hints for window in normal state.Startup state (normal or iconified).Keyboard focus model used by the application.Window group; for applications with multiple top-level windows,
this describes which window is the main window for iconifying.The window manager, not Xlib, chooses its own default response
when any of these properties are not set.  Also, they are only
hints.  A window manager determines what to do with this information
and is allowed to ignore it.  They will, of course, be ignored if no
window manager is running.The following sections describe the properties set by the client
that indicate its preferences to the window manager.  Table 12-1

window manager behavior.  Clients can assume that at least the
first part of this string is visible to the user, unless the user
has made an explicit decision to make it invisible by placing the

arithmetic progression of sizes, from the minimum size to the
maximum size, into which the window prefers to be resized.  For
example, xterm prefers size increments matching the dimensions
of the font being used.The following algorithm should be used by the window manager to
calculate the displayed size of the top-level window.  i
and j are nonnegative integer loop variables within the
window manager that would be incremented until a size that matches
the window manager's window management policy is reached.ID="SC-1002-12-1"width = base_width + (i * width_inc)

managers will use i and j instead of width
and height in reporting window sizes to users.  Similarly,
applications should interpret the command line or user default
geometry using width_inc and height_inc pixels
instead of single pixels as the unit.  xterm, for example,
interprets size specifications in terms of multiples of the font
dimensions, not in pixels.  A default xterm window has
80 columns and 24 rows of characters.  To create an xterm
window with more rows, you can use the command:ID="SC-1002-12-2"spike%xterm -geometry 80x40  The min_aspect and max_aspect members specify the
desired range of ratios of width to height for the window and are
each expressed as a ratio of the x and y members of
min_aspect and max_aspect.  (The ratio x / y
in min_aspect or max_aspect is the minimum or maximum
value for width / height.)The base_width and base_height fields if set are used
instead of min_width and min_height.  If they are
not set, min_width and min_height are used.The win_gravity field
controls how the window's initial position will be
interpreted by the window manager.  By default, this hint is
NorthWestGravity, which means that the position of the
window when mapped by the application is used by the window manager
as the position of the northwest corner (top-left) of the window.
The other values for this field are CenterGravity,
EastGravity, NorthEastGravity, NorthGravity,
SouthEastGravity, SouthGravity, SouthWestGravity,
and WestGravity.  If the hint is set to CenterGravity,
the window manager will place the center of the window where the
origin of the window was when the application mapped it.The flags member of XSizeHints indicates which

important since it supports the power structure--the user overrides
the window manager, and the window manager overrides the program in

the window manager the keyboard focus model used by the application.  LINKEND="FN-1002-12-3"ID="FN-1002-12-3"To remind you, the keyboard focus is the window to which keyboard
events go, sometimes ignoring the pointer position.  When the pointer
is outside the keyboard focus window, all keyboard events are delivered
to that window.  When the pointer is inside the keyboard focus window
or any of its descendants, keyboard events are delivered to the window
containing the pointer.
For the input hint to be read by the window manager, the InputHint
constant must be specified in the flags field of XWMHints.There are four input models:MARK="BULLET"No Input.  The client never expects keyboard input.  An
example would be xload or another output-only client.Passive Input.  The client expects keyboard input but never
explicitly sets the keyboard focus.  An example would be a simple
client with no subwindows, which will accept input in
PointerRoot mode, or when the window manager sets the
keyboard focus to its top-level window (in click-to-type mode).Locally Active Input.  The client expects keyboard input and
explicitly sets the keyboard focus but only does so when one of its
windows already has the focus.An example of a Locally Active style client would be a client with
subwindows defining various data entry members.  Such an application
might use Next and Prev keys to move the keyboard focus between the
members, once its top-level window has acquired the focus in
pointer-following mode or when the window manager sets the
keyboard focus to its top-level window (in click-to-type mode).Globally Active Input.  The client expects keyboard input and
explicitly sets the keyboard focus even when the focus is set to a
window the client does not own.  An example would be a client with a
scrollbar that wants to allow users to scroll the window without
disturbing the keyboard focus even if it is in some other window.
The client wants to acquire the keyboard focus when the user clicks
in the scrolled region, but not when the user clicks in the scrollbar
itself, and then set the focus back to its original window.  Thus,
the client wants to prevent the window manager setting the keyboard
focus to any of its windows.Clients using the Globally Active and No Input models should
set the input flag to False.  Clients using
the Passive and Locally Active models must set the
input flag to True.If your application requires keyboard input and you neglect to
set the input flag to True, you application will
not get keyboard events under some window managers, such as
olwm.

the window manager whether the application prefers to start off
in iconified or normal state.
initial_state specifies the state the client prefers
to be in at the time the top-level window is mapped.
The window manager does not reread this property so it is
not useful for changing state after a window has been mapped.
How to request a change of state is described in LINKEND="S3-1002-12-12"Section 12.3.6.1, "Changing Application State."

icon from other clients.  This pixmap should be:MARK="BULLET"One of the sizes specified in the XA_WM_ICON_SIZEID="IX-1002-12-113"XA_WM_ICON_SIZE property
property on the root, as described in LINKEND="S3-1002-12-10"Section 12.3.4.1, "XA_WM_ICON_SIZE."One bit deep.  The window manager will select, through the
resource database, suitable background (for the 0 bits) and
foreground (for the 1 bits) colors.  These resources can, of
course, specify different colors for the icons of different clients.The icon_mask is a one-bit-deep pixmap that determines
which pixels in icon_pixmap are drawn on the icon window.
This allows for icons that appear to be nonrectangular.  Some
window managers (including uwm) use the icon pixmap as a
background tile for the icon window, a method which does not allow
for the use of a mask.icon_window is a window created but not mapped by the client.
Clients that need to know their icon's ID or want to draw more than
a simple two-color bitmap on the icon should set this hint.  For
example, xbiff and xmh change their icon pixmap when
mail arrives, and they need to know their icon's ID to do this.
Therefore, they must supply an icon window.The icon_window hint should not be used unless needed.  When
it is not specified, the window manager creates the icon window itself.You do not know which of the hints the window manager will honor.  With
current window managers, you can be confident that if icon_window
is set, the window it names will be visible.  If not, if icon_pixmap
is set, the pixmap it names is visible.  Otherwise, the window's
XA_WM_ICON_NAME string is visible.The conventions specify that the window
manager must use the specified icon window.  Therefore the application
can read events from that icon window if desired.An application that sets an icon_window is responsible for
redrawing the window in case of Expose events.  One way to
set the icon design to be displayed is to set the background pixmap
attribute of the icon window.  The advantage of this approach is that
there is no need to handle Expose events for the icon, because
the background is automatically redrawn by the server.  The disadvantage
is that there is no way to apply a mask to generate a nonrectangular icon.The icon window:MARK="BULLET"Must be an InputOutput child of the root window.Should be one of the sizes specified in the XA_WM_ICON_SIZEID="IX-1002-12-114"XA_WM_ICON_SIZE property

since it provides a fallback for window managers whose ideas
about icons differ widely from those of the client.ID="IX-1002-12-117"XSetWMHintsSet a pixmap into the icon_pixmap member of the
XA_WM_HINTS property and possibly another into the
icon_mask member.  The window manager is expected to
display the pixmap masked by the mask.  The pixmap should be
one of the sizes found in the XA_WM_ICON_SIZE property
on the root.  Window managers will normally clip or tile pixmaps
which do not match XA_WM_ICON_SIZE.Or:MARK="BULLET"Set a window into the icon_window member of the
XA_WM_HINTS property.  The window manager is expected
to use that window instead of creating its own and to map that
window whenever the client is in IconicState.  In
general, the size of the icon window should be one of those
specified in XA_WM_ICON_SIZE on the root, if that
property exists.  Window managers may resize icon windows.
If the client supplies an icon window, it is responsible
for redrawing it when necessary.ID="S4-1002-12-5"Window Group FieldID="IX-1002-12-118"windowsgroups of top-levelThe window_group member of XWMHints lets the
client specify that it has multiple top-level windows which
should be iconified together or managed by the window manager
as a group.  For example, group leaders may have the full set
of decorations and other group members a restricted set.Applications with only one top-level window need not set this hint.One of the top-level windows is known as the group leader.  The
window_group member of the hints for each of the other
top-level windows should be set to the window ID of the group leader.The group leader may be a window which exists only for that purpose
and may never be mapped.  Its window_group member should
contain its own ID.  The properties of the window group leader are
those for the group as a whole (for example, the icon to be shown
when the entire group is iconified).  Every other top-level window
may also have its own hints applicable only to itself.ID="S4-1002-12-6"Transient Window FieldID="IX-1002-12-119"windowstransientID="IX-1002-12-120"transient windowsID="IX-1002-12-121"XSetTransientForHintID="IX-1002-12-122"windowstemporaryID="IX-1002-12-123"temporary windowsAll temporary subwindows of the root, such as pop-up menus and

ID="IX-1002-12-124"XSetTransientForHintXA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property to the ID of the top-level
window of the application that is creating the temporary window.
This allows the window manager to process the temporary window
accordingly (perhaps by decorating it differently than if it were
a separate application).  In particular, window managers will present
newly mapped transient windows without requiring any user interaction,
even if mapping top-level windows normally does require interaction.ID="IX-1002-12-125"override_redirect attributeID="IX-1002-12-126"attributesoverride_redirect
It is important not to confuse XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR with the
override_redirect window attribute.  The override_redirect
attribute specifies that the window manager does not get the chance
to intercept the mapping request and thus no chance at all to decorate
the window.  This should be done only on the most temporary of windows,
such as menus, or on windows that the programmer wants to be mapped
without window manager intervention, such as automated demonstration
programs.  XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR should be used when other windows
are allowed to be active while the transient window is visible, such as
when the pointer is not grabbed while the window is popped up.  If other
windows must be frozen, use override_redirect and grab the pointer
while the window is mapped.ID="IX-1002-12-127"save_under attributeID="IX-1002-12-128"attributessave_under
Temporary windows that are popped up frequently should also set the
save_under window attribute so that windows beneath the window
may not need to redraw themselves quite so often.
ID="IX-1002-12-129"pop-up windowsID="IX-1002-12-130"windowspop-upTo summarize, clients wishing to pop up a window should do one of three things:MARK="BULLET"They can create and map another normal top-level window, which will get
decorated and managed as a separate client by the window manager.  See
the discussion of window groups in LINKEND="S4-1002-12-5"Section 12.3.1.4.5, "Window Group Field."If the window will be visible for a relatively short time and deserves
a somewhat lighter treatment, they can set the XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
property.  They can expect less decoration but should set all the normal
window manager properties on the window.  An example of an appropriate
case would be a dialog box.If the window will be visible for a very short time and should not be
decorated at all, the client can set the override_redirect
window attribute.  In general, this should be done only if the pointer
is grabbed while the window is mapped.  The window manager will never
interfere with these windows, which should be used with caution.
An example of an appropriate use is a pop-up menu.ID="S3-1002-12-5"Application Class Name and Instance Name - XA_WM_CLASSThe XA_WM_CLASS property is a string containing two null-separated
ID="IX-1002-12-131"XA_WM_CLASS propertyID="IX-1002-12-132"class (resource)property
fields, res_class and res_name.  res_class is
meant to be used by the window manager to look up resources
applicable to this application in the resource database.
The window manager uses res_name
for the titlebar of the window.The application should normally specify res_class as the
application name with an initial capital.If the res_name field is NULL, then the following
is used:NUMERATION="Loweralpha"If "-name NAME" is given on the command line, NAME is used as the
instance name.Otherwise, if the environment variable RESOURCE_NAME is set,
its value will be used as the instance name.Otherwise,
argv[0] stripped of any directory names is used as the
instance name.Note that WM_CLASS strings, being null-terminated, differ from
the general conventions that text properties are null-separated.
This inconsistency is necessary for backwards compatibility.An application should look up its own resources in the resource database
using XGetDefault() or with the resource manager routines described
ID="IX-1002-12-133"resource managerID="IX-1002-12-134"XGetDefault
in LINKEND="CH-1002-13-1"Chapter 13, "Managing User Preferences."  If the user defaults are not found under
res_name, the application should use res_class.The XA_WM_CLASS property should only be written once and
must be present when the window is mapped; window managers will
ignore changes to it while the window is mapped.The XA_WM_CLASS property contains a structure of type
XClassHint.  Example 12-4 shows the XClassHintID="IX-1002-12-135"XClassHint structureID="IX-1002-12-136"structuresXClassHint

in a controlled manner, so that a session made up of several running
applications can be halted and restarted in its original state.  This
is useful, for example, when the user wants to log out without having
to start from scratch when logging back in.Note that session managers are rare or nonexistent at the present
time.  Nonetheless, these conventions should be honored because it
is only a matter of time before session managers become available.
And the session manager does not necessarily need to be a separate
client from the window manager.  A window manager may have
session-management capabilities.There are two properties that need setting for the benefit of session
managers, WM_COMMAND and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE.  These
supply the command and arguments needed to invoke an application in
its current state and the machine on which it should be run.  Together
they supply enough information to restart the application.  These are
described in the following sections.

command and arguments but also the machine on which the client was
running.  The application sets the WM_CLIENT_MACHINE property
to contain this information, using XSetWMClientMachine().
ID="IX-1002-12-149"XSetWMClientMachineThis property should be set to a string forming the name of the
machine running the client as seen from the machine running the server.ID="S2-1002-12-3"Optional Properties for Window and Session ManagerThe client will need to set one or more of the following properties
if it uses multiple colormaps, if it takes the keyboard focus, if
it has data that must be saved before the session manager kills it,
or if it has multiple top-level windows and it would like to survive
when the user deletes one of them.ID="S3-1002-12-8"Using Created Colormaps - WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWSID="IX-1002-12-150"installing colormapsAn application should never install its own colormap.
The window manager needs certain information from the application to
be able to install colormaps at the appropriate times.  An application
that uses colormaps other than the default must do two things to make
sure that the window manager knows which colormaps to install for
each window:MARK="BULLET"Set the colormap window attribute of each window that is
to use a colormap other than the default.Set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the application's
top-level window to tell the window manager which windows use colormaps
different from the top-level window's colormap.  In other words, you do
not need to set WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS unless your application uses more
than one colormap.The top-level window is always assumed to need its colormap
ID="IX-1002-12-151"XSetWMColormapWindowsID="IX-1002-12-152"XGetWMColormapWindows
installed.  Applications set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property
with XSetWMColormapWindows(), and the window manager reads
it with XGetWMColormapWindows().ID="S3-1002-12-9"Window Manager Protocols - WM_PROTOCOLSSetting the WM_PROTOCOLS property is optional.  It is for
applications that can benefit from being notified by the window manager
or session manager of certain conditions.The WM_PROTOCOLS property contains a list of atoms, each
identifying a communication protocol between the application and the
window manager in which the application wants to participate.  Atoms
can identify both standard protocols and private protocols specific
to individual window managers.  All the protocols in which a client
can volunteer to take part involve the window manager sending the
client a ClientMessage event.  The message_type
field of the event will be the atom for WM_PROTOCOLS,
and the data field will contain the atom for one of
the protocols listed in
LINKEND="TB-1002-12-5"Table 12-5.ID="TB-1002-12-5" COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"ProtocolLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"PurposeLEFT="0" WIDTH="117"WM_TAKE_FOCUSLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"Assignment of keyboard focus.LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"WM_SAVE_YOURSELFLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"Save client state warning.LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"WM_DELETE_WINDOWLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"Request to delete top-level window.LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"More to come...LEFT="125" WIDTH="356"LBL="12-5"Table 12-5   Current Standard WM_PROTOCOLSNote that none of the above properties are represented by
predefined atoms.  Therefore, you will need to call
XInternAtom() once for each one that you intend to use.An application sets the WM_PROTOCOLS property using
XSetWMProtocols(), and the window or session manager
reads it with XGetWMProtocols().ID="S4-1002-12-7"WM_TAKE_FOCUSApplications that use the Locally Active and Globally Active focus
models should specify that they want to participate in this protocol.
Under both these focus models, the application explicitly sets the
keyboard focus to one of its windows.  Any application that does not
set the keyboard focus to any of its windows does not need to
participate in this protocol.To applications that specify WM_TAKE_FOCUS, the window manager
may send a ClientMessage event with the atom corresponding
to WM_TAKE_FOCUS in their data[0] field.  If the
application wants the keyboard focus, it should respond by calling
XSetInputFocus() with its window argument set to the
window of theirs that last had the keyboard focus or to their default
input window and with the time argument set to the timestamp
in the message.  The revert_to argument should be set to
RevertToParent.A client could receive WM_TAKE_FOCUS when opening from an icon
or when the user has clicked outside the top-level window in an area
that indicates to the window manager that it should assign the focus
(for example, clicking in the headline bar can be used to assign the focus).The goal of WM_TAKE_FOCUS is to support window managers that
want to assign the keyboard focus to a top-level window in such a way
that the top-level window can either assign it to one of its subwindows
or decline the offer of the focus.  A clock, for example, or a text editor
with no currently open frames might not want to take focus even though
the window manager generally believes that clients should take the
keyboard focus after being deiconified or raised.Clients that call XSetInputFocus() must set the time
argument to the timestamp of the event that caused them to make
the attempt.  Note that this cannot be a FocusIn event,
since they do not have timestamps, and that clients may acquire
the focus without a corresponding EnterNotify.  Clients
must not use CurrentTime in the time field.Clients using the Globally Active model can only use
XSetInputFocus() to acquire the input focus when they
do not already have it on receipt of one of the following
events:  ButtonPress, ButtonRelease,
passive-grabbed KeyPress, and passive-grabbed KeyRelease.In general, clients should avoid using passive-grabbed key events
for this purpose except when they are unavoidable (as, for example,
a selection tool that establishes a passive grab on the keys that
cut, copy, or paste).Clients that set the input focus should set the revert_to
argument of the XSetInputFocus() request to the parent of the
window that is to be the new focus window.  This determines the
behavior of the input focus if the window the focus has been set
to becomes not viewable.  All other settings lead to problems, as
described in Appendix L, Interclient Communcation Conventions,
of Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual (as of the second printing).Clients should not give up the input focus of their own volition.
They should ignore input that they receive instead.ID="S4-1002-12-8"WM_SAVE_YOURSELFThis protocol is for applications that would like to be notified
before the window or session manager terminates them, so that they
can save their state and place themselves in a state from which
they can be restarted.  Such termination, from the application's
perspective, would otherwise bypass all the application's internal
safety measures (such as when an editor reminds you to save before
exiting).Applications that express interest in this protocol may receive a
ClientMessage event the atom for WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
in its data[0] field.Clients receiving WM_SAVE_YOURSELF should place themselves
in a state from which they can be restarted and should update
XA_WM_COMMAND (by calling XSetCommand()) to
be a command that will restart them in this state.  The session
manager will be waiting for a PropertyNotify event on
XA_WM_COMMAND as a confirmation that the client has
saved its state, so that XA_WM_COMMAND should be updated
(perhaps with a zero-length append) even if its contents are correct.
No interactions with the user are permitted during this process.After receiving the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF message through the event,
saving its state, and updating XA_WM_COMMAND, the client
should not change its state (in the sense of doing anything that
would require a change to XA_WM_COMMAND) until it receives
a mouse or keyboard event.  Once it does so, it can assume that
the danger is over.  The session manager will ensure that these
events do not reach clients until the danger is over or until the
clients have been killed.Clients with multiple top-level windows should ensure that only one
of their top-level windows has a nonzero-length XA_WM_COMMAND
property.  They should also respond to a WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
message by (in this order):NUMERATION="ARABIC"Updating the nonzero length XA_WM_COMMAND property
if necessary.Updating the XA_WM_COMMAND property on the window for
which they received the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF message if it
was not updated in step 1.ID="S4-1002-12-9"WM_DELETE_WINDOWThis protocol prevents the possibility of an application with multiple
top-level windows being terminated unexpectedly by the session manager.
It should be selected by applications whose server connection must
survive the deletion of some of their top-level windows.  Clients
which choose not to include WM_DELETE_WINDOW in the
WM_PROTOCOLS property will be disconnected from the server if
the user asks for one of the client's top-level windows to be deleted.Once an application has expressed interest in this protocol, if one
of the top-level windows is deleted, the application will receive a
ClientMessage event whose data[0] field is the atom
for WM_DELETE_WINDOW.Clients receiving a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message should behave as
if the user selected "delete window" from a (hypothetical) menu.  They
should perform any confirmation dialogue with the user, and if they
decide to complete the deletion, either:MARK="BULLET"Change the window's state to Withdrawn (as described in LINKEND="S3-1002-12-12"Section 12.3.6.1, "Changing Application State")
and release all associated state (backing store, for example), orDestroy the window.If the user aborts the deletion during the confirmation dialogue,
the client should continue as if it never received the
ClientMessage event that began the dialogue.If the client aborts a destroy and the user then attempts to
delete the window again, the window manager should start the
WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol again.  Window managers
should not use XDestroyWindow() on a window that has
WM_DELETE_WINDOW in its WM_PROTOCOLS property.Note that the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF and WM_DELETE_WINDOW
protocols are orthogonal to each other and may be selected independently.ID="S2-1002-12-4"Properties Set by the Window ManagerID="IX-1002-12-153" SPAN="START"propertiesset by window managerID="IX-1002-12-154" SPAN="START"window managerproperties set byThe properties described above are those which the client is responsible
for maintaining on its top-level windows.  This section describes what
the client can do with the properties that the window manager sets to
give information to the client.  There are currently two such properties.
XA_WM_ICON_SIZE stores information about the sizes of icons that
the window manager prefers.  The application should use this information
to create an icon pixmap or window of one of the right sizes.The other property, WM_STATE, stores the current state (normal,
iconic, or withdrawn) of the application.  This is mostly for communication
between the window manager and session manager but may also be used by
some applications.ID="S3-1002-12-10"XA_WM_ICON_SIZEID="IX-1002-12-155"iconssizesID="IX-1002-12-156"size of iconThe window manager may set the XA_WM_ICON_SIZE property on the

or pixmap of an appropriate size as part of the XWMHintsID="IX-1002-12-158"XWMHints structure

   int max_width, max_height;
   int width_inc, height_inc;
} XIconSize;The width_inc and height_inc members define an arithmetic
progression of sizes, from the minimum size to the maximum size,
representing the supported icon sizes.  XGetIconSizes() actually
returns a list of these structures, in case the window manager needs
more than one to specify all of its accepted icon sizes.Some commercial window managers set this property.  Clients should be
prepared to create an icon pixmap to fit the hint of each of the standard
window managers and can even use the hint to determine which window manager
is in operation.Window managers use XSetIconSize to set this property for clients.XAllocIconSize() function should be used to allocate and
zero the XIconSize structure.ID="S3-1002-12-11"WM_STATEAccording to the ICCCM adopted as of Release 4, the window manager
sets this property on top-level windows.  The contents of this
property is for communication between window managers and session
managers.  However, the existence of the property set on a window
may be used to identify the top-level windows of other applications,
for applications that need this information.Xlib currently provides no routines for reading or writing this
property, but of course, you can use XChangeProperty() or
XGetWindowProperty().This property does not have a predefined atom--to read or write
this property you will need to call XInternAtom() to get the
atom for this property.

enough information to read and write the property in any format (8-bit,

before calling XSetWMProperties(), in order to set the window
name and icon name properties, as was done in basicwin
in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program."  There are two ways to do this:  one is to
set the fields directly one at a time, and the other is to use
XStringListToTextProperty().  The latter is easier and better,
because it does not require hardcoding the format or encoding.
See Example 3-9 for a demonstration of how to do this.

XTextProperty structure:XTextPropertyToStringList()Creates a list of strings from an XTextProperty structure.

pattern of an application's top-level window's border (usually to
indicate which window has the keyboard focus), so this window must be
an InputOutput window.  This also means that the application
should not try to use the border to indicate any application state.The client may receive notification that its window has been reparented,
moved, resized, raised, or lowered or that its border width has been
changed by selecting StructureNotifyMask on its top-level
window.  It should not respond to these events by trying to change
any of these characteristics, however.

wish to be iconified, deiconified, or taken completely off the
screen.  There are right and wrong ways to do this.ID="IX-1002-12-178"XIconifyWindowAn application can call XIconifyWindow() to have
one of its top-level windows iconified.  This function sends a
ClientMessage event to the window manager, telling it
to iconify this application.  There is no equivalent routine to
have the window manager return the application to normal state.ID="IX-1002-12-179"XWithdrawWindowIt is also possible to tell the window manager to unmap
both the top-level window and its icon.  This is done by calling
XWithdrawWindow().  This is useful because the window manager
rereads all the standard properties when the window returns from
withdrawn to normal state.LINKEND="FN-1002-12-4"ID="FN-1002-12-4"Remember that resetting a property with a complex structure such as
XA_WM_HINTS or XA_WM_NORMAL_HINTS redefines all
members in that property.  You must reset all fields, even those
which you are not changing since the last time you set the property.There is no routine to tell the window manager to change a withdrawn
application back into normal state.  The technique under version 1
conventions
is for client to set the initial_state field of the XWMHints
structure to NormalState, then call XSetWMHints() to reset
this property, and then map the top-level window.To change from withdrawn state to iconic state, the
application should follow the same procedure but set the
initial_state field to IconicState.To change from iconic state to normal state, the client needs
only to map the window--it need not reset the property.If a client selects StructureNotifyMask on the top-level
window, it will receive an UnmapNotify event when it
moves to iconic state and a MapNotify when it moves
to normal state.Clients can also select VisibilityChangeMask on their
top-level or icon windows.  They will then receive a
VisibilityNotify event (with the state field
set to VisibilityFullyObscured) when the window concerned
becomes completely obscured even though mapped (and thus perhaps
a waste of time to update) and a VisibilityNotify event
(with state field not set to VisibilityFullyObscured)
when it becomes even partly viewable.ID="S3-1002-12-13"Reconfiguring the Top-level WindowClients can resize, reposition, and restack
ID="IX-1002-12-180"reconfiguring top-level windows
their top-level windows using XReconfigureWMWindow().  This
routine is the same as XConfigureWindow(), except that it
takes care of an error condition possible when running under a
reparenting window manager.  XReconfigureWMWindow() lets you
specify a sibling window relative to which your top-level window
should be stacked, and this will work even if the window manager
has reparented your top-level window so that what once was a sibling
is no longer a sibling.Even when the client is not attempting to change the stacking order,
the entire reconfigure request is sent by the server to the window
manager for approval, and the window manager has the opportunity
to honor, modify, or deny the request.  The client finds out the
window manager's decision through ConfigureNotify events.Most applications do not need to specify or even suggest the position
of their top-level windows.  However, when doing so, the position the
client specifies should be relative to the root window regardless of
reparenting.Client requests to reconfigure the top-level window are interpreted
by the window manager in the same manner as the initial window
geometry mapped from withdrawn state.  There is no guarantee that
the window manager will allocate the requested size or location,
and clients must be prepared to deal with any size and location.The window manager has several options in deciding how to respond
to a request by the application to reconfigure a top-level window:MARK="BULLET"Not changing the size or location of the window at all, a client
will receive a synthetic ConfigureNotify event describing
the (unchanged) state of the window.  The (x,y) coordinates will be
in the root coordinate system, adjusted for the border width the
client requested, irrespective of any reparenting that has taken
place.  The border_width will be the border width the client
requested.  The client will not receive a real ConfigureNotify,
since no change has actually taken place.Moving the window without resizing it, a client will receive a synthetic
ConfigureNotify event following the move describing the new state
of the window, whose (x,y) coordinates will be in the root coordinate
system adjusted for the border width the client requested.  The
border_width will be the border width the client requested.  The
client may not receive a real ConfigureNotify event describing
this change, since the window manager may have reparented the top-level
window.  If it does receive a real event, the synthetic event will
follow the real one.Resizing the window (whether or not it is moved), a client
which has selected StructureNotifyMask will receive a
ConfigureNotify event.  Note that the coordinates in
this event are relative to the parent, which may not be the
root if the window has been reparented, and will reflect the
actual border width of the window, which the window manager
may have changed.  XTranslateCoordinates() can be used
to convert the coordinates if required.The general rule is that coordinates in real ConfigureNotify
events are in the parent's space, whereas in synthetic events, they
are in the root space.Clients should be aware that their borders may not be visible.
Most window managers use reparenting techniques to decorate
client's top-level windows with titles, controls, and other details.
Ones that do are likely to override the client's attempts to set the
border width and set it to zero.  Clients should, therefore, not
depend on the top-level window's border being visible nor use it
to display any critical information.  Other window managers will
allow the top-level windows' borders to be visible.Clients should ignore the above field of all
ConfigureNotify events that they receive on their top-level
windows, since they cannot be guaranteed to contain useful information.

want to exchange information with other clients.  A selection
transfers arbitrary information between two clients.  You can think
of a selection as a piece of text or graphics that is highlighted in
one application and can be pasted into another, though the information
transferred can be almost anything.  Clients are strongly encouraged
to use this mechanism so that there is a uniform procedure in use by
all applications.The user may want to transfer information from an application and,
at other times, to the application.  Many applications need to be
able to assume either role.  In particular, clients should not
display text in a permanent window without allowing the user to
select it and convert it into a string, and any application that
requires the user to type extensively should allow the user to
paste in text from other applications.ID="IX-1002-12-188"owner clientID="IX-1002-12-189"requestor clientID="IX-1002-12-190"clientownerID="IX-1002-12-191"clientrequestor
Selections communicate between an owner client and a
requestor client.  The owner has the data representing the
value of a selection, and the requestor wants it.  The selection
mechanism provides a way to notify other clients when useful data
is placed in a property and to allow the owner of the data to
convert it to a type asked for by the requestor.Note that in the X11 environment, all data transferred between
clients must go via the server (unless they are running on the same
host, but that is a special case).  An X11 client can neither assume
that another client can open the same files nor communicate directly
through IPC channels.  The other client may be talking to the server
via a completely different networking mechanism (for example, one
client might be DECnet and the other TCP/IP).  Thus, passing indirect
references to data such as file names, hostnames, port numbers, and
so on is permitted only if both clients specifically agree.ID="S2-1002-12-7"The Selection MechanismLet's look how a typical selection transaction occurs and then
go into all the details of how to make it happen.  From the
user's point of view, it works like this:NUMERATION="ARABIC"The user highlights a selection of text or graphics in one
application.  For example, in xterm, selections are
highlighted with the foreground and background colors reversed.The user moves the pointer into another application and presses
the key or button that indicates that the selection should be
pasted.  The keys or buttons used for this purpose in all
applications probably should be the ones used by xterm,
since most users use the cutting and pasting feature of
xterm frequently.The desired result is that the text or graphics should appear
in the application in which it was pasted.  Now how do two
applications actually make this happen?ID="IX-1002-12-192"selectionsacquiringThe application in which the text or graphics is being selected
must first of all figure out what information is being selected
and be able to convert it into a format that can be transferred
to other applications.  If the selection is text (usually the
selection is a string) and the selected area is highlighted,
by having the user drag the pointer over the area, then this
application has to become the owner of a selection atom.ID="IX-1002-12-193"atomsXA_PRIMARYID="IX-1002-12-194"atomsXA_SECONDARYID="IX-1002-12-195"XA_PRIMARY atomID="IX-1002-12-196"XA_SECONDARY atomID="IX-1002-12-197"selectionsatoms
There are two built-in selection atoms:  XA_PRIMARY and
XA_SECONDARY.  Unless the client foresees needing two
simultaneous selections, it should use XA_PRIMARY.  It calls
XSetSelectionOwner(), specifying the selection atom, any window
that it created (this window is used by other applications to identify
the owner), and the time.  The time used should be from the event that
triggered the bid to own the selection (not CurrentTime)
because of race conditions that can otherwise occur.  If the client
ID="IX-1002-12-198"XSetSelectionOwnerID="IX-1002-12-199"SelectionClear eventID="IX-1002-12-200"eventsSelectionClear
does not already own the selection atom, then this call will generate
a SelectionClear event for the old owner, telling it to
unhighlight the old selection.Each client that wants to be able to have a selection pasted
into it must set aside a key or button combination to indicate
that the user wishes to paste in the current selection.  In
response to the event that occurs when that key or button
combination is pressed, the client calls XConvertSelection().
This call specifies which selection the application wants
(XA_PRIMARY until other conventions are established),
the property to place the data in, the window on which to set
this property, and the time.  These arguments are quite clear.
But the XConvertSelection() call also specifies a target
type that the application wants the data in.  You need to
understand what happens after the XConvertSelection()
call to understand the purpose of the target type property.
ID="IX-1002-12-201"XConvertSelectionID="IX-1002-12-202"XSelectionRequestEvent structureThe server places all the arguments of the XConvertSelection()
call into an XSelectionRequestEvent and sends the event to
the selection owner.  The owner then tries to convert the selection
data into the format specified in the target type property.  If the
selection owner knows how to convert the data into the requested
type, it puts the data in the property specified in the event and
returns the atom of this property in the property member
of a SelectionNotify event.  If the selection owner cannot
convert the selection into the requested type, it returns None
as the property member in the SelectionNotify event.  The
owner sends this SelectionNotify event using XSendEvent().
ID="IX-1002-12-203"SelectionNotify eventID="IX-1002-12-204"eventsSelectionNotifyWhen the requestor receives the SelectionNotify event, it
either reads the property if it is set, repeats the request with a
different target type if the owner returned None, or gives up
on pasting data from that selection owner.  It could be that the user is
trying to do something like paste graphics into a text-only application.Now you should understand the selection mechanism in general, so
let's look at a more tangible example of how it takes place.ID="S2-1002-12-8"An Example of SelectionID="IX-1002-12-205" SPAN="START"selectionsexample ofLet's say a text editor is the owner of the selection XA_PRIMARY.
The user is editing a C program and debugging the same C program in
another window.  The user would like to select a line in the source
code and instruct the debugger to stop at that same line without
having to type in the line number.  Perhaps the debugger would have
a button labeled "stop at," which, when pressed, would tell the debugger
to request a value for the primary selection.  The text editor would
allow the user to select text on a line and would be able to convert
that selection into a string if it were pasted into another text editor
or into a line number if it were pasted into the debugger.  Which type
the text editor would choose would depend on the target type of the
selection request.Assuming the text editor already uses the selection mechanism to
transfer text to other applications, adding the line number capability
should be easy.  It would simply need to look for a new target type
that indicated to it to figure out what line number the selected text
is on.  It might choose the first line, if more than one line were
selected, or simply display an error message telling the user to
select a single line.The debugger application would then make the call shown in Example 12-7.

The text editor stores the data in the property specified in the
SelectionRequest event on debugger_window, then sends
a SelectionNotify event (using XSendEvent()) to the
requesting application.  Upon receiving this event, the debugger reads
this property and uses its value to place a break point in the C program.Now that you have seen a more practical application of selections,
we'll move on to a more precise description of each step in the
selection transfer process.

also makes sure that only one application at a time is attempting to set

which indicates to it that it should clear any area it has highlighted.Note that if the time in the XSetSelectionOwner() request is
in the future relative to the server's current time or if it is in
the past relative to the last time the selection concerned changed
hands, the XSetSelectionOwner() request appears to the client
to succeed, but ownership is not actually transferred.  To

space to accommodate the data.If the property member is not None, then that
property will exist on the requestor window.  The value
of the selection can be retrieved from this property using

to retrieve the value of a selection, the property

property types that might apply to selections are XA_BITMAP,

Other types that clients could define might be XA_FILE_NAME
or XA_PICTURE (a sequence of graphics primitives to reproduce
a picture--the Macintosh uses this type of selection to cut and
paste graphics into text applications and vice versa).It is important to observe that defining a new atom consumes
resources in the server, and they are not released until the server
reinitializes.  Thus, it must be a goal to reduce the need for newly
minted atoms.The selection named by XA_PRIMARY is used for all commands
which take only a single argument.  It is the principal means of

communication between applications.  Cut buffers are particularly
good for editors, because they can act like a stack of buffers,
recording the history of deletions.The selection mechanism is superior for many applications, since
it allows communication regarding the type of the data transferred.
Selections are described in LINKEND="S1-1002-12-4"Section 12.4, "Selections."  It is also possible
for an application to use both cut buffers and selections.The cut buffers are eight properties on the root window of screen 0
of a server.  The buffers are numbered 0 to 7.  Cut buffers rely on
a prior agreement between the two clients regarding the format of the
data to be placed in the cut buffers.  The data that can be placed in
a single cut buffer is limited to the maximum size of a single property,
which is server-dependent.Because the cut buffers are properties, it is possible to be notified
when they have been written into.  PropertyNotify events can

assist applications in timing their communication.  These are selected
with PropertyChangeMask.

stack of data.  A client using this cut buffer mechanism must
initially ensure that all eight buffer properties exist, using
XChangeProperty() to append zero-length data to each.  A
client storing data in the cut buffers (an owner) must first rotate
the ring of buffers by +1, using XRotateWindowProperties to rename
XA_CUT_BUFFER0 to XA_CUT_BUFFER1 to .... to
XA_CUT_BUFFER7 to XA_CUT_BUFFER0.  It must then store
the data into XA_CUT_BUFFER0, using XStoreBytes().A client obtaining data from the cut buffers should
use XFetchBytes() to retrieve the contents of
XA_CUT_BUFFER0.A client may, in response to a specific user request, rotate the
cut buffers by -1, using XRotateWindowProperties to rename
XA_CUT_BUFFER7 to XA_CUT_BUFFER6 .... and so on and
XA_CUT_BUFFER0 to XA_CUT_BUFFER7.Data should be stored to the cut buffers and the ring rotated only
when requested by explicit user action.  Users depend on their mental
model of cut buffer operation and need to be able to identify
operations that transfer data to and from the buffers.Note that there is nothing magic about the properties used by Xlib's
cut buffer routines or those routines themselves.  If an application
needs more buffers, it can intern additional atoms for CUT_BUFFER8
and so on and write its own equivalent of XStoreBuffer() and
XFetchBuffer() that can write and read these properties.

application, should be in control of the way things work.  For this
reason, applications should allow the user to specify window geometry
and many other characteristics both via command line options and in a
file that specifies default preferences.  This chapter discusses the
use of the resource manager, which helps an application to evaluate
and merge its own default with user preferences.  While the
information in this chapter is not essential for X programming, it is
essential for writing programs that will work in ways that users will
come to expect.  For additional information on the resource manager at
work, see Chapter 12.ID="IX-1002-13-1"resource specificationsID="IX-1002-13-2"user resource specificationsID="IX-1002-13-3"user preferencesID="IX-1002-13-4"preferencesuserID="IX-1002-13-5"resourcesdefaultID="IX-1002-13-6"resource managerID="IX-1002-13-7"resource databasesApplications can and should be made user customizable.  Every
application should provide command line options for the most
important configurable elements of the application, such as colors
or patterns for the window border and background, foreground colors
for drawing, desired geometry of the application, fonts, and so on.
Furthermore, an application should allow users to set all options
through the resource database.A resource is a configurable program option (completely different
from a server resource, such as a window).  There are a set of
resource files and resource properties that may contain
settings for program options.  When all the resource files and properties
are merged into a single database by Xlib, the result is called the
resource database.  Each setting for a resource in any of these
files or properties or in the resource database is called a resource
specification.  The routines and database structures used for managing
user preferences are collectively referred to as the resource manager.

in a file in their home directory called .Xdefaults.  Additional
resource specifications could be stored in a file pointed to by the
shell environment variable XENVIRONMENT or in a host-specific
file called .Xdefaults-host, where host is the
name of the system where the client is running.
ID="IX-1002-13-10".Xdefaults-host fileHowever, experience showed that this approach caused problems for
users running clients from multiple machines across the network.
A separate .Xdefaults file had to be maintained for each
machine.  For this reason, the
xrdb program was designed to
install the user's preferences in the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGERID="IX-1002-13-11"XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property
property on the root window of the current server.  In this way, all
clients running on the same server share the same user preferences.
The old mechanism is still supported for compatibility, but
.Xdefaults is read only if the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER
property has not be set with xrdb.  Another advantage of having
ID="IX-1002-13-12"xrdb application
the user's resource specifications set with xrdb is that they
are stored in a property instead of a file, and therefore, they can
be more easily managed by the session manager (although none of these
exist yet), since changing a property from a program is much easier
than editing a file from a program.ID="IX-1002-13-13"XGetDefaultXGetDefault() provides a simplified interface that applications
can use to read options from the resource database.  However, there
is also a complete set of resource manager routines, which were
ID="IX-1002-13-14"resource managerroutinesID="IX-1002-13-15"user preferencesmanaging
originally developed for the Xt Toolkit, which can be used to process
resources in a more thorough and expandable way.  The Xt Toolkit
resource manager was merged into Xlib because the task of managing
user preferences is common to all X applications.  By making the
resource manager part of Xlib, the developers ensured that all
toolkits layered on Xlib will use the same mechanism, providing
users with a consistent interface.  In the Xt Toolkit, all objects
(called widgets) are configurable through the resource database.
And as you will see, the object-oriented nature of the Xt Toolkit
is also apparent in the resource manager.  Even though most Xlib
ID="IX-1002-13-16"resource managerrole of in Xt Toolkit
applications are not object-oriented and therefore cannot take full
advantage of the capabilities of the resource manager, they can still
benefit from using it.ID="IX-1002-13-17"resource managersyntaxAll resource manager routines except XGetDefault() have names
beginning with Xrm, so they are conveniently grouped
together in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.  You must include <X11/Xresource.h> to
use XGetDefault() or the other resource manager functions.
ID="IX-1002-13-18"Xresource.h include fileID="IX-1002-13-19"include filesXresource.hIn the following sections, we'll talk about handling user
preferences using XGetDefault() and using the resource
manager routines.  We'll also talk about how to use
XParseGeometry() and XGeometry, which parses
the standard format for window size and placement preferences
(whether specified on the command line or in a resource file
or property).After that, we'll discuss the format of the data in the resource
manager database.  The rules for specifying preferences are fairly
complex, although for most Xlib applications, using them is quite simple.Finally, we'll talk briefly about some more advanced resource
manager routines.ID="S1-1002-13-1"Using XGetDefault()ID="IX-1002-13-20"XGetDefaultXGetDefault() allows a program to determine a value for an
option by searching the resource database.  In R5 and later, use
of XGetDefault() is discouraged because it does not read
all the current resource files and properties; the low level
routines described in LINKEND="S1-1002-13-2"Section 13.2, "Using the Low-level Resource Manager Routines" should be used instead.XGetDefault() reads the resource
specifications from the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property in
the server or, if that is not set, the user's .Xdefaults file.
Next, if there is an XENVIRONMENT environment variable, then
the file specified in it is loaded as well.  The value returned by
ID="IX-1002-13-21"XENVIRONMENT environment variableID="IX-1002-13-22"environment variablesXENVIRONMENTXGetDefault() for a particular program/option key will be the
last match found in this list.Actually, the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property is automatically
ID="IX-1002-13-23"XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property
copied from the server into the Display structure returned by
XOpenDisplay().  Therefore, each call to XGetDefault()
does not really read that property directly but, instead, a local
copy of it.  Therefore, XGetDefault() does not require a
round-trip request and is quite fast.ID="IX-1002-13-24"XGetDefaultweaknessesUnfortunately, XGetDefault() does not do the whole job of
handling program options.  XGetDefault() does not parse the
command line options or read the application-specific resource file.
You need to use the other resource manager routines to handle these.Normally, the command line options are read one at a time, and if
a command line argument is present for a particular option, it
overrides any value that might be present in the resource database,
and therefore XGetDefault() does not need to be called.  But
if no value for a particular option is found, XGetDefault()
must be called.  If XGetDefault() returns a non-NULL string,
that is the option value, which usually has to be converted into
a useful type for the program.  If XGetDefault() returns
NULL, your program needs a default value, which it can
read from a database file in the app-defaults directory
ID="IX-1002-13-25"app-defaults directory
using XrmGetFileDatabase() and XrmGetResource() or,
less desirable but easier, it can hardcode the default values.The sequence of operation for using XGetDefault() is shown
in Figure 13-2.ID="FG-1002-13-1"Procedure for processing user resource specifications with XGetDefault()FORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.13.01.gif" ID="GC-1002-13-1"Example 13-1 shows the code for one way to handle program

ID="IX-1002-13-32"XGetDefaultID="IX-1002-13-33"resource managerinterface with XGetDefaultXGetDefault() is not trivial, even though XGetDefault()
is supposed to be the simple interface to the resource manager.
Also, XGetDefault() does not read all the resource files and
properties that an application should use.
It is not any easier to use the low-level resource manager calls,
but they do a more thorough job.For one, there is a single routine that takes care of parsing the
ID="IX-1002-13-34"parsing the command line
command line and loading the values found there into the resource
database.  Secondly, there are several more resource files that
XGetDefault() does not read but that an application really
should.  You can mechanize the whole process of handling program
options by turning every set of options into a database, merging
them into a single database, and then extracting the correct values.
The resulting code is easier to expand or modify than code that uses
XGetDefault().First, let's describe the additional resource files that we will
handle with the low-level resource manager routines.ID="S2-1002-13-1"Resource Files and MergingAll applications
need fallback settings for all configurable options in case the user
does not set these options.  Instead of hardcoding these as defined
constants, they can be placed in another resource file.  Then if they
need to be changed by the application writer, only the resource file
needs editing, and the application does not need to be recompiled.
Another advantage of this approach is that it allows all fixed text
in the application to be specified in resource files instead of in
the code, and this makes it easier to convert an application to a
foreign language.  The application-specific resource specifications
ID="IX-1002-13-35"app-defaults directory
can also be stored in a file in the directory /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.
(Each file should have the same name as the application itself, except
with the first letter capitalized, unless the application name begins
with an X, in which case the first two letters can be capitalized.)The other additional resource files add flexibility; each is
intended to be set by either the user, the application writer,
or the system administrator.  More are for
foreign language conversion.  The user will only be expected
to use the .Xdefaults file or the property set by the
xrdb utility.  The complete set of resource files and
properties and the order in which they are merged as of R4 as follows:MARK="BULLET"Classname file in the app-defaults directory.Classname file in the directory specified by the
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH or XAPPLRESDIR environment variables.Property set using xrdb, accessible through the
XResourceManagerString() macro or, if that is empty,
the .Xdefaults file in the user's home directory.File specified by the XENVIRONMENT environment variable
or, if not set, the .Xdefaults-hostname file in the user's
home directory.Command line arguments.The order in which the various options are merged is important.
A value for an option in the user's resource specifications should
override the program's default for that option, but a value on the
command line would override both the program's and the user's default value.In R5 and later, the order of merging defined by the Xt Intrinsics
sets the standard in this area now that XGetDefault() is not
recommended.  For complete information on the order of merging
done by Xt, see Chapter 6 in the Programmer's Supplement for
Release 5 or Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual.

The directory of the included file is interpreted
relative to the directory of the file in which the

themselves contain #include directives, and
there is no specified limit to the depth of this nesting.
Note that the C syntax
#include <filename> is not supported;
neither Xlib nor Xt defines a search path for included files.The ability to include files is useful
when producing a special app-defaults file for use on
a color screen, for example, you can simply include the monochrome
app-defaults file and then set or override the color
resources as you desire.  This technique is
particularly useful when producing app-defaults files
for use with the customization resource defined by

This property contains the user's resource customizations in
string form, and is usually set with the program
xrdb.  The contents of this property
should be merged in when creating the resource
database to be used by an application.  Until R5 this
single RESOURCE_MANAGER property contained
resources for all screens of a display, and there was
no way for a user to specify different resources for
different screens (for example, color
vs. monochrome).ID="IX-1002-13-49"SCREEN_RESOURCESsetting resources inIn R5, xrdb can set resources in the
SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of
each screen of a display.  Now the specifications in the
SCREEN_RESOURCES property should be used to
override the screen-independent
RESOURCE_MANAGER specifications.  The resource
database that is created in this way is the database of the
screen, rather than the database of the display.  If
the same application is executed on different screens
of a display, or if a single application creates top-level
windows on more than one screen of a display, a
resource database will be created for each screen, and
the application instances or top-level windows will find
resources in them that are appropriate for that screen.Two new functions support
screen-dependent resources and resource databases.  The
contents of the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on
the root window of a screen are
returned by the function XScreenResourceString().The client xrdb has been rewritten for R5 to
handle the new screen-specific properties.  Any load,
merge, or query operation can now be performed on the
global RESOURCE_MANAGER property, a specific
screen property, all screen properties, or all screen
properties plus the global property.  This last option
is the default and "does the right thing"--the input
file is processed through the C preprocessor once for
each screen, and resource specifications that would
appear in all of the per-screen properties are placed
in the global property and removed from the
screen-specific properties.  With this new system, a
defaults file which uses #ifdef COLOR to
separate color from monochrome resource specifications
can be used to correctly set the values of the
screen-dependent and screen-independent properties for
a two-screen monochrome-and-color display.  An
application can then be run on either screen and find the
correct user defaults for that screen.

the preferred size and placement of a window or icon.  By
convention, rather than having the user specify various elements
of the size and placement with separate options, clients accept
a single standard geometry string, which has the following
format:
ID="IX-1002-13-75"standard geometrystring formatID="SC-1002-13-2"<width>x<height>{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>Items enclosed in <> are integers, and items enclosed in {}
are a set from which one item is allowed.  The xoffset and
yoffset values are optional.  They determine the position of
the window or icon--for the top-level window, they are, by convention,
interpreted relative to the origin of the root window.  The convention
is that if the sign of xoffset or yoffset is positive,
they specify that the offset is measured from the top or left edge of
the application window to the top or left edge of the screen.  If the
sign of xoffset or yoffset is negative, they specify
that the offset is measured from the bottom or right edge of the
application window to the bottom or right edge of the screen.After being read in from the command line or from a preference file,
this string can be separated into separate x, y,
width, and height values with XParseGeometry().

ID="IX-1002-13-76"XParseGeometryID="IX-1002-13-77"XWMGeometryIn addition, there is a function called XWMGeometry() that can
be used to parse a partial

geometry string specified (presumably) by the user, which
might not be complete, and the set of size hints that define the programs
desired geometry.  If the user-specified
string specifies an element of the geometry, that value is used;
otherwise, the corresponding value from program's default geometry
string is used.  The resulting values are used to set the window manager

overruled by a program-specific entry with the same resource name.
The last element between a period or asterisk and the colon is the
resource name.This simple example demonstrates the rules as commonly practiced in
Xlib applications.  However, there are a number of additional rules
that come into play in more complex, object-oriented applications,
such as those written with the Xt Toolkit.  Preferences may apply
only to a particular subwindow within an application.  For example,
the xmh mail handler allows the user to set preferences for
multiple levels of windows.  These levels can be specified explicitly
or by using a wildcard syntax denoted by the asterisk.As a result, you should think of the syntax for preference
specifications, not as:
client.keyword: value
but as:
object...subobject...resourcename:  value
where the hierarchy of objects and subobjects not only
usually corresponds to major structures within an application
(such as windows, panels, menus, scrollbars, and so on) but
also can be a class of such objects.Individual elements in the hierarchy of objects and subobjects are
called components.  Component names can be either instance
names or class names.  By convention, instance names always
begin with a lowercase letter, while class names always begin with
an uppercase letter.  Instances and classes are concepts in
object-oriented programming, not normally used in Xlib programming.
For a detailed description of instance and classes and how they
appear in resource specifications, see Volume Four, X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual.ID="IX-1002-13-87"resource databasesmatching rulesID="IX-1002-13-88"matching rulesresource database
Both instance and class names may include either uppercase
or lowercase letters anywhere but in the starting position;
in fact, for clarity, a component name is often made up of
multiple words concatenated without spaces, with an initial
capital serving as the word delimiter.  For example,
buttonBox might be the instance name for a window
containing command buttons, while ButtonBox would
be the corresponding class name.ID="IX-1002-13-89" SPAN="START"resource managerdatabase exampleFor example, consider a hypothetical mail-reading program called
xmail, which is similar to the current xmh application.  LINKEND="FN-1002-13-3"ID="FN-1002-13-3"We do not discuss the actual xmh application, even though it
does use an object-oriented approach, because speaking hypothetically
gives us greater freedom to set up illustrative examples.
As shown in Figure 13-3, xmail is designed in such a manner that
it uses a complex window hierarchy, all the way down to individual command
buttons which are small subwindows.  If each window is properly assigned
a name and class, it becomes easy for the user to specify attributes
of any portion of the application.ID="FG-1002-13-3"The hypothetical xmail displayFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.13.03.gif" ID="GC-1002-13-3"The top-level window is called xmail.  It contains a series of
vertically-stacked windows (panes), one of which contains all the command
buttons controlling the program's functions.  This control pane is named
toc (table of contents).  One of the command buttons is used to
incorporate (fetch) new mail.This button needs the following resources:MARK="BULLET"Label stringFontForeground colorBackground colorForeground color for its highlighted stateBackground color for its highlighted stateA full instance name specifying the background color of the
include button might be:ID="SC-1002-13-3"xmail.toc.includeButton.backgroundColorDefining class names allows the user to set resource values
more freely.  The pane containing the buttons could be of class
ButtonBox, and the buttons themselves are all of class
CommandButton.  Therefore, the background of all the
buttons could be identified with:ID="SC-1002-13-4"Xmail.ButtonBox.CommandButton.BackgroundColorThe user could do something like this:ID="SC-1002-13-5"Xmail.ButtonBox.CommandButton.BackgroundColor:  blue
xmail.toc.includeButton.backgroundColor:        redwhich would make all command buttons blue except the one
instance specified (includeButton), which would be red.
ID="IX-1002-13-90" SPAN="END"resource managerdatabase exampleIt might not be immediately apparent how you could use a class for
the name of the application itself.  However, consider the emacs
family of text editors.  Microemacs and GNU emacs could both be
considered members of the class Emacs.  Or assume that
you were using a toolkit to build a group of applications with a
similar user interface.  It might be desirable to let the user
specify attributes for features of all these applications.  You
might define a general class of vertically paned applications
called Vpane.ID="IX-1002-13-91"instance versus classID="IX-1002-13-92"class (resource)versus instance
The distinction between instance names and class names becomes
important when you are retrieving an option value from the
resource database.  Routines such as XrmGetResource() that
retrieve data from the database must specify two separate strings
ID="IX-1002-13-93"retrieval keys
(retrieval keys)--one made up completely of instance names,
and the other of class names.  Both strings must be fully specified.ID="S2-1002-13-5"Tight Bindings and Loose BindingsID="IX-1002-13-94"tight bindingsID="IX-1002-13-95"bindingstightID="IX-1002-13-96"bindingslooseID="IX-1002-13-97"loose bindingsThe components in a resource specification can be bound together
in two ways:  by a tight binding (a dot, .) or by a loose binding
(an asterisk, *).  Thus, xmail.toc. background has three name
components tightly bound together, while Vpane*Command.foreground
uses both a loose and a tight binding.Bindings can precede the first component but may not follow the last
component.  By convention, if no binding is specified before the first
component, a tight binding is assumed.  For example, xmail.background
and .xmail.background both begin with tight bindings before the
xmail, while *xmail.background begins with a loose binding.The difference between tight and loose bindings comes when a function
like XrmGetResource() is comparing two resource specifications.
A tight binding means that the components on either side of the binding
must be sequential.  A loose binding is a sort of wildcard, meaning that
there may be unspecified components between the two components that are
loosely bound together.  For example, xmail.toc.background
would match xmail*background and *background, but not
xmail.background or background.Because loose bindings are flexible, they are very useful
for defining resource specifications.  They allow resource
specifications to match many specific applications and will
still match if the applications are slightly changed (for example,
if an extra level is inserted into the hierarchy.)ID="IX-1002-13-98"resource databasesstorage/access rulesID="IX-1002-13-99"storage rules for resource database
A resource specification used to store data into the database can
use both loose and tight bindings.  This allows the user to specify
a data value which can match many different retrieval keys.  In
contrast, retrieval keys from the database can use only tight
bindings.  You can only look up one item in the database at a time.Remember also that a resource specification can mix name and class
components, while the retrieval keys are a pair of specifications
without values, one consisting purely of name (first character
lowercase) components and one consisting purely of class (first
character uppercase) components.ID="S2-1002-13-6"Wildcarding Resource Component NamesID="IX-1002-13-100"wildcardsand resource component namesID="IX-1002-13-101"? wildcardID="IX-1002-13-102"resource databases? wildcardIn R5 and later, resource databases allow the character
? to be used to wildcard a single component (name or
class) in a resource specification.  Thus the
specification:ID="SC-1002-13-6"xmail.?.?.Background: antique whitesets the background color for all widgets (and only
those widgets) that are grandchildren of the top-level
window of the application xmail.  And the
specification:ID="SC-1002-13-7"xmail.?.?*Background: brick redsets the background color of the grandchildren of the
top-level window and all of their descendants.  It does not set
the background color for the child of the top-level
window or for any popup windows.  These kinds of
specifications simply cannot be done without the ?
wildcard; sometimes the * wildcard does not provide
the necessary fine-grained control.  To set the
background of all the grandchildren of an application
window without the ? wildcard, it would be
necessary to specify the background for each grandchild
individually.There is one obvious
restriction on the use of the ? wildcard:  it cannot be
used as the final component in a resource
specification--you can wildcard widget names, but not
the resource name itself.
Also, remember that the wildcard
? (like the wildcard *) means a different thing in
a resource file than it does on a UNIX command line.The ? wildcard is convenient in cases
like those above, but it has more subtle uses that have
ID="IX-1002-13-103"* wildcard
to do with its precedence with
respect to the * wildcard.  First, note the important
distinctions between the ? and the * wildcards:  a ?
wildcards a single component name or class and
falls between two periods (unless it is the first
component in a specification), while the * indicates
a "loose binding" (in the terminology of the resource
manager) and falls between two component names or
classes.  A ? does not specify the name or class of
a resource component, but does at least specify the
existence of a component.  The * on the other hand
only specifies that zero or more components have been
omitted from the resource.Recall that in order to look up the value of a
resource, an application must provide a fully
specified resource name, i.e., the name and class of
each resource component.  The returned value will be
from the resource in the database that most closely
matches the full resource specification provided by the
application.  To determine which resource matches best,
the full resource specification is scanned
from left to right, one component at a time.  When there is more than
one possible match for a component name, the following
rules are applied:
As these rules are applied, component by component,
entries in the resource database are eliminated
until there are none remaining or until there is a
single matching entry remaining after the last
component has been checked.  These rules are not new
with R5; they have simply been updated to accommodate
the new ? wildcard.With these rules of precedence in mind, consider
what happens when users specify a line like
*Background: grey in their personal resource
files.  They would like to set the background of all
widgets in all applications to grey, but if the
app-defaults file for the application "xmail" has a
specification of the form *Dialog*Background: peach, the background of the dialog boxes in the
xmail application will be peach-colored, because this
second specification is more specific.  So if they
really don't like those peach dialog boxes,
(pre-R5) users will have to add a line like
XMail*Background: grey to their personal
resource files, and will have to add similar lines for
any other applications that specify colors like "xmail"does.  The reason this line works is rule 1 above:  at
the first level of the resource specification, "XMail"is a closer match than *.This brings us to the specific reason that
the ? wildcard was introduced:  any resource
specification that "specifies" an application name with
a ? takes precedence over a specification that
elides the application name with a *, no matter how
specific the rest of that specification is.  So
in R5, the frustrated users mentioned above
could add the single line:ID="SC-1002-13-8"?*Background: greyto their personal resource files and achieve the desired
result.  The sequence ?* is odd-looking, but correct.
The ? replaces a component name, and the * is
resource binding, like a dot (.).The solution described above relies, of course, on the
assumption that no app-defaults files will specify an
application name in a more specific way than the user's
?.  If the "xmail" app-defaults file contained one of
the following lines:ID="SC-1002-13-9"xmail*Dialog*Background: peach
XMail*Background: maroonthen the user would be forced to explicitly override
them, and the ? wildcard would not help.
To allow for easy customization, programmers should write
app-defaults files that do not use the name or class of
the application, except in certain critical resources
that the user should not be able to trivially or
accidentally override.  The standard R5 clients have
app-defaults files written in this way.ID="S2-1002-13-7"The -name OptionID="IX-1002-13-104"class (resource)namesIf you set up your resource specifications to use the class name for
a program instead of an instance name, users can then list instance
resources under an arbitrary name that they specify with the
-name option to a program.  For example, if xterm were
set up this way, with the following resources defined:ID="SC-1002-13-10"XTerm*Font:                 6x10
smallxterm*Font:            3x5

resource databases into a single database when an application starts up.
When your application requests a value for a particular parameter
from the resource database, using XrmGetResource(), this is
called a query.  The query takes completely specified instance and
class names that we will call retrieval keys, and selects the
most closely matching resource specifications from the
database.  The magic of the resource manager is that it always returns
a single value even if multiple entries in the database match the
retrieval keys.
The algorithm for determining which resource database
entry best matches a given query is the heart of the resource manager.The resource manager compares component
by component, matching a component from the resource specification
against both the corresponding component from the instance retrieval
key and the corresponding component from the class retrieval key.
If the resource specification component matches either retrieval key
component, then that component is considered to match.  For example,
the resource specification xmail.toc.Foreground matches the
instance retrieval key xmail.toc.foreground and the class
retrieval key Vpane.Box.Foreground.ID="IX-1002-13-108"bindingslooseID="IX-1002-13-109"loose bindingsID="IX-1002-13-110"wildcards
Because the resource manager allows loose bindings (wildcards)
and mixing names and classes in the resource specification, it
is possible for many resource specifications to match a single
instance/class retrieval key pair.  To solve this problem, the
resource manager uses the following precedence rules to determine
which is the best match (and only the value from that match will
be returned).  To determine which of two resource specifications takes
precedence, each level (and each binding) of the two resource
specifications is compared, starting from the colon and working
from right to left.  Each of the rules is applied at each level,
before moving to the next level, until only one resource specification
remains.  The precedence rules starting from the highest
precedence are as follows:NUMERATION="ARABIC"A resource that matches the current component by name,
by class, or with the ? wildcard takes precedence
over an resource that omits the current component by
using a *.ID="SC-1002-13-12"*topLevel.quit.background:         and
*topLevel.Command.background:      and
*topLevel.?.background:            take precedence over
*topLevel*background:A resource that matches the current component by name
takes precedence over a resource that matches it by
class, and both take precedence over a resource that
matches it with the ? wildcard.ID="SC-1002-13-13"*quit.background:                  takes precedence over
*Command.background:               takes precedence over
*?.background:A resource in which the current component is preceded
by a dot (.) takes precedence over a resource in which the
current component is preceded by a *.ID="SC-1002-13-14"*box.background:                   takes precedence over
*box*background:Situations where both rule 2 and rule 3 apply often cause confusion.
In these cases, remember that rule 2 takes precedence since it occurs
earlier in the list above.  Here is an example:ID="SC-1002-13-15"*box*background:                   takes precedence over
*box.Background:As an example of applying these rules, assume the following user

and return "black."  However, it also matches
*Command.Foreground but with lower preference,
so it would not return "green."ID="IX-1002-13-111"class (resource)choosingThe programmer should think carefully when deciding which classes
to use.  For example, many text applications have some notion of
background, foreground, border, pointer, and cursor or marker color.
Usually the background is set to one color, and all of the other
attributes are set to another, so that they may be seen on a
monochrome display.  To allow users of color displays to set any or
all of them, the colors might be organized into classes as follows:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="72"InstanceLEFT="80" WIDTH="356"ClassLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"backgroundLEFT="80" WIDTH="356"BackgroundLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"foregroundLEFT="80" WIDTH="356"ForegroundLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"borderColorLEFT="80" WIDTH="356"ForegroundLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"pointerColorLEFT="80" WIDTH="356"ForegroundLEFT="0" WIDTH="72"cursorColorLEFT="80" WIDTH="356"ForegroundLBL="13-1"Table 13-1   Setting ClassesThen to configure the application to run in "monochrome"mode but using two colors, the user would have to
use only two specifications:ID="SC-1002-13-19"obj*Background:  blue
obj*Foreground:  redThen if the user decided to make the cursor yellow but have
the pointer and the border remain the same as the foreground,
you would need only one new resource specification:ID="SC-1002-13-20"obj*cursorColor: yellowAll the resource manager rules for matching and precedence

an XrmValue.  Physically, database values consist of a size
and an address. The size is specified in machine-dependent units,
while the address is a machine-dependent pointer to the character
string in uninterpreted machine memory.The declaration of the XrmValue is shown in Example 13-6.

} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;In addition, a representation type is stored along with each value
in the data structure.  The corresponding representation type is
returned along with the data value when the database is accessed.
The type provides a way to distinguish between different
representations of the same information.  For example, a color
may be specified by a color name ("red") or be coded in a
hexadecimal string ("#4f6c84"), by a pixel value, or by RGB
values.  Representation types are user-defined character strings
describing the way the data is represented.  You specify them
when you store data, and you interpret them when you access data.
Previous releases of X contained programs to perform automatic
type conversion.  These converter routines and types were found
to be insufficiently general and were removed from Xlib.  However,
similar conversion functions are now being implemented in the X Toolkit.You create representation types from simple character strings
by using the macro XrmStringToRepresentation.  For example:
ID="IX-1002-13-119"resource managermacrosID="SC-1002-13-21"XrmStringToRepresentation("RGB_value")might be used if the data to be stored was a color represented
as an RGB value.  Certain functions let you store data without
specifying a representation type.  These functions always take
data in the form of a char[] and automatically
assign it the representation type String.  The type
XrmRepresentation is internally represented as an
XrmQuark, since it is an ID for a string.

data is stored into a database with XrmMergeDatabases() or
XrmPutResource() and related routines.  A client that does
not use these functions should be safe using the addresses to

combines the contents of a "source" database and a
"target" database, using the contents of the source to
override the contents of the target.  With this
function, there is no way to get "augment"-style
behavior; i.e., there is no way to combine the two databases so that
when source and target contain different values for the
same resource specification the value in the target
database is left unchanged.  The two new functions
XrmCombineDatabase() and
XrmCombineFileDatabase() address this problem.
They take a source database and a target database, or
the name of a resource file and a target database, and
also a Bool argument which specifies whether
the resource from the source database or the file
should override values in the target database.  Thus
the following two function calls are equivalent:ID="SC-1002-13-22"XrmMergeDatabases(source, target);
XrmCombineDatabase(source, target, True);Because the contents of resource files are often merged
into databases, the function
XrmCombineFileDatabase() was added as a shortcut
for a call to XrmGetFileDatabase()
followed by a call to XrmCombineDatabase().
Note that the new R5 functions use the singular
"Database," while XrmMergeDatabases()
uses the plural.These functions were added in R5 because of a
required change in the way the X Toolkit builds up its
resource database.  Prior to R5, that database was
built from sources in low-priority to high-priority
order, each new source overriding the existing contents
of the database, and XrmMergeDatabases() was
sufficient for this purpose.  But with the advent of
the customization resource in R5, it was necessary to
build the database in reverse order so that the
value of the customization resource could be obtained
from any of the other sources before being used to
locate the application's app-defaults file.  When the
order of database creation was reversed, it was
necessary to combine databases by augmenting rather
than overriding so that the resulting single merged
database would be the same.  XrmCombineDatabase()
and XrmCombineFileDatabase() were added for
precisely this purpose.ID="S2-1002-13-12"Enumerating Database EntriesID="IX-1002-13-137"XrmEnumerateDatabaseID="IX-1002-13-138"resource databasesenumerating entriesID="IX-1002-13-139"enumerating database entriesPrior to R5 it was possible to query particular
resources in a database or write the contents of a
database to a file, but there was no way for a program
to individually process each entry of a database.
XrmEnumerateDatabase() fills this need.  This
function calls a user-supplied procedure once for each
entry in a database that matches any completion of a
specified partial name and class list.  The enumeration
can be performed a single level below these name and
class prefixes, or for all levels below.  The
"callback" procedure invoked by this function returns a
Bool and causes the enumeration to terminate
by returning True.ID="IX-1002-13-140"appresThe client appres, which previously relied on

automatic in Xt applications) to
build a resource database for each display that is
opened, and it is common to talk about the "database of
the display."  Before R5, however, there was no
standard way to associate a database with a display for
later retrieval.  In the MIT Xlib implementation, there is a
database field in the Display structure, and
prior to R5 the X Toolkit used this field even
though the Display structure is supposed to be
opaque.In R5, however, there are functions to set and get
the database of the display:  XrmSetDatabase() and
XrmGetDatabase().  These are simply utility
functions; they provide a public interface to fields in
an opaque data structure.  No Xlib routines use these
functions, but XtDisplayInitialize() sets the database of
the display for later use by XtResolvePathname().  Note
that Xlib does not provide a way to associate a display
with a screen.ID="S2-1002-13-14"Getting the Locale of a DatabaseID="IX-1002-13-146"XrmLocaleOfDatabaseID="IX-1002-13-147"resource databasesreturning locale ofAs described in LINKEND="CH-1002-10-1"Chapter 10, "Internationalization," every XrmDatabase()
is parsed in the current locale and has that locale
associated with it.  To return the name of the locale
of a database, use the new function
XrmLocaleOfDatabase().ID="S2-1002-13-15"QuarksID="IX-1002-13-148"quarksA special data type called a quark is used internally by
the resource manager to represent strings.  They were created
to improve the efficiency of the resource manager.  The resource
manager needs to make many comparisons of strings when it gets
data from the database.  It must compare, component by component,
the name and class specification of the requested resource to
each stored key in the database.  Quarks are simple identifiers
(presently represented as integers) for strings.  Thus, instead
of comparing strings, the resource manager converts each component
of the string into the corresponding quark and compares the quarks
instead.  This converts lengthy string comparisons into quick numeric
comparisons, with the obvious savings in efficiency.  The price is
the overhead needed to convert back and forth between strings and
quarks, but this is a small price for avoiding multiple string
comparisons in a large database.In summary, then, a quark is to a string as an atom is to a property.
Quarks, however, are local to the application.Quarks are implemented using an internal table of strings.  The
function XrmStringToQuark() returns a pointer to the quark
for a given string.  Clients that do more than just access their
resource specifications once might consider calling
XrmStringToQuark() for each string and then using
the quark form of the routines that get resources.Prior to R5, the resource manager functions made a
copy of all strings when they were registered as quarks.
Most strings were widget
names, resource names, and resource classes hardcoded into
an application's executable, but the copying was required
for those few quarks that were created with
ID="IX-1002-13-149"XrmPermStringToQuarkID="IX-1002-13-150"XrmStringToQuark
dynamically-allocated strings.  R5 contains a new function,
XrmPermStringToQuark(), which behaves like
the existing XrmStringToQuark() except that it
assumes that the passed string is either a string
constant hardcoded into the application or at least is
in memory that will not be modified or de-allocated for
the lifetime of the application.  This assumption means
that the string need not be copied, and therefore
memory is saved.  There is no direct connection between
ID="IX-1002-13-151"XpermallocXrmPermStringToQuark() and Xpermalloc().
Strings in memory allocated with Xpermalloc() may
be passed to XrmPermStringToQuark() as long as
they will not be changed during the lifetime of the
application.

handle quarks.  They are described in Appendix C, Macros, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual,

convention for macros, since they begin with Xrm (no other macros
begin with X), possibly because the resource manager used to be

important X programming techniques, it was far from a complete
application.  This chapter describes a calculator program that
provides for calculations in several bases.  This program has a more
robust event loop than the simple application in Chapter 3 and
demonstrates the use of the resource manager routines for integrating
user preferences.Our basic window program in LINKEND="CH-1002-3-1"Chapter 3, "Basic Window Program," did not do all the
things an application normally should do.  We should have more
complete communication with the window manager, parse the command
line, and merge these options with the user's defaults to set up
user-preferred colors and miscellaneous options.  This chapter
describes and demonstrates these techniques with a real application,
basecalc.
ID="IX-1002-14-1" SPAN="START"basecalc applicationThe basecalc application is a programmer's calculator that allows
integer calculations in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal and
conversions between these bases.  It is not quite as complicated as
xcalc, the standard calculator for X, but it demonstrates X
techniques just as well.  basecalc also does base conversions,
logical operations, and unsigned arithmetic,
which xcalc does not.
ID="IX-1002-14-2"calculator exampleOnly the sections of the program that illustrate X concepts are shown
and described in this chapter.  The entire program is shown in
Appendix D, The basecalc Application.This program has one characteristic that is not strictly correct in
the X environment.  It has only one allowable size.  If the window
manager refuses its request for that size or its main window is
reduced in size by the user, it should print a message indicating that
it cannot operate in that space.  Luckily, most window managers
honor the application's size hints and refuse
to resize the window.ID="S1-1002-14-1"Description of basecalcID="IX-1002-14-3"basecalc applicationdescription ofFigure 14-1 shows basecalc on the screen.  It is
a calculator which can perform integer math in decimal, octal,
hexadecimal, or binary and can convert values between any of these
bases.  The calculator may be operated with the pointer by pressing
any pointer button on the calculator pads or with the keyboard by
typing the same symbols shown on the calculator face.See the Preface for information on how to get the example

display, in which the values punched on the calculator and the results
are displayed.  The digits (0 to 9) and letters (A to F) in the
left-hand portion of the calculator keypad are for entering values.
The top row of the right-hand portion of the keypad is for base
selection.  These can be used either to set the current base of
calculations or to convert a value between bases.  Only one of
the base indicators is highlighted at a time.ID="IX-1002-14-4"basecalc applicationhow to useOnly valid numbers in the current base are allowed to be entered.
Valid pads are black, while invalid ones are light gray.  When a
pad is triggered by pressing a pointer button, it flashes white,
and the operation or value indicated by the pad is executed if
the pointer button is released in the same pad.  The pad also
responds to the pointer entering or leaving the window while a
pointer button is pressed.The calculator also operates from the keyboard.  Numbers,
letters, and special characters can be typed in (or pasted
from another application) to represent all the functions
except Clear Entry (CE).  The Backspace key also performs
this function.ID="IX-1002-14-5"portabilityof basecalc exampleID="IX-1002-14-6"basecalc applicationportability of
This application runs on any X system, since it uses only the
colors black and white.  It achieves the appearance of different
levels of gray by creating a pattern with differing amounts of black
and white.  It also provides command line arguments for colors and
uses them if the user specifies them and if connected to a color screen.Here is the list of available functions and how they are
used.  If you do not plan to be using basecalc, skip to

for options are normally found in the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window.  That property is normally set by the
user with the xrdb program.  For compatibility, if there is no
XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property defined (either because xrdb
was not run or if the property was removed), your program should assume
that the defaults can be found in a file called .Xdefaults in
the user's home directory.Note that XGetDefault(), described in LINKEND="CH-1002-13-1"Chapter 13, "Managing User Preferences,"
only deals with some of this complexity.  It does not read the
XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property, and it does not merge in the
command line arguments.  That is why, in this example, we have used

}ID="IX-1002-14-20"XrmParseCommandThe large options table (opTable) defines all the command
line arguments that XrmParseCommand() is going to look for.
It describes not only what flag to look for but also the style of
each option.  Some options are a simple flag, others are a flag
followed by a value with no space or with a space, and so on.  The
options table also specifies what to call each option when searching
for it in the database.Example 14-5 shows the structure that defines the options table.

} XrmOptionKind;The styles of command line arguments allowed are as follows:
ID="IX-1002-14-27"command-line argumentsoption stylesID="IX-1002-14-28"option styles (command line)XrmoptionNoArgIf this flag is present, take the value in the value member
(the last column) of the options table.  For example, the -u
(unsigned) option for the calculator indicates that the value should
be off and the calculator should begin in unsigned mode.XrmoptionIsArgThe flag itself indicates something without any additional information.
In the case of the calculator, -x or -h indicates that it
should start up in hexadecimal mode.XrmoptionStickyArgThe value is the characters immediately following the option with no
white space intervening.  This is not used in the calculator, but it
is like the arguments for uucico, where -sventure means to
call system venture.XrmoptionSepArgThe next item after the white space after this flag is the value of
the option.  For example, the option -fg blue would be of this
type and would indicate that blue is the value for the resource specified
by -fg.XrmoptionResArgThe resource name and its value are the next argument in argv
after the white space after this flag.  For example, the flag might
be -res and the resource name/value might be
basecalc*background:white.XrmoptionSkipArgIgnore this option and the next argument in argv.XrmoptionSkipLineIgnore this option and the rest of argv.As XrmParseCommand() parses the command line, it removes
arguments that it finds in the options table from argv
and argc.  Therefore, if argc is nonzero after
XrmParseCommand(), at least one of the command line
arguments was illegal.  The best thing to do is print both
the illegal options (by printing argv) and the correct
option syntax.If all the options were correctly parsed, then it is time to
extract the display name so that we can connect with the display.
We need to connect now because we want to get the user's resource
database from the server to merge with the command line arguments
we already have.  If there was no display specified on the command
ID="IX-1002-14-29"XOpenDisplay
line, we use NULL as usual to connect to the server indicated
in the UNIX environment variable DISPLAY.  We set the global variable
screen_num to the default screen number so that we can use
it in future macro calls.ID="IX-1002-14-30"opening displaysIt would be possible (and actually preferable) to search the other
local databases, namely the app-defaults/* and .Xdefaults
files, for a display name before connecting to the display.  This was
not done in basecalc because of an oversight.ID="S2-1002-14-3"Getting the DatabasesID="IX-1002-14-31"loadingdatabasesID="IX-1002-14-32"databaseloadingThe mergeDataBases routine shown in Example 14-6 reads

order, and then merges in the database obtained from the command
line.  As described in LINKEND="CH-1002-13-1"Chapter 13, "Managing User Preferences," we will use
the R4 set of resource files and merging order since it's a lot
less complicated than the R5 order defined by the Xt Intrinsics:MARK="BULLET"Classname file in the app-defaults directory.

file and loads it into a database, returning a pointer to the
database.  This database should contain the default values for
each configurable variable used in the program.  This file should
look just like a user preference file, and it should parallel every
option in the command line options table.  In case this file is
unavailable, the application should also have hardcoded defaults
for all these values, but it should not have to use them.Note that Example 14-6 gets the user's database set by xrdb
from the value returned by the XResourceManagerString() function.
ID="IX-1002-14-39"XResourceManagerString
This function returns a pointer to a string stored in the Display
structure.  This string is set by XOpenDisplay() to the value of
the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window of screen 0.  LINKEND="FN-1002-14-1"ID="FN-1002-14-1"Note that because the XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property is read by
XOpenDisplay(), it is read only once, during application startup.
Therefore, any changes to this property after startup will not be
reflected in the application.  This property (and all the other resource
files) is for initial startup information only.
This string can easily be translated into a database with

advantage of all the options supported in

for tiling in various shades of gray.  This program is written to
operate correctly on any kind of display.  If the display is simple
monochrome without grays, you can still get gray shades by creating
different pixmaps with slightly different ratios of black and white
pixels.  The light gray pixmap is used for disabled pads, which are
not valid in the current base.  The dark gray pixmap is used for the
background of the calculator.  Simple pixel values of BlackPixel()
and WhitePixel() are used for valid and selected pads.  The symbols
BLACK, WHITE, DARKGRAY, and LIGHTGRAY
are defined to clarify the code.  If foreground and background colors
are specified on the command line, they will also be used in the pixmaps,
and their colors will be mixed.The windata structure provides information about each subwindow
on the calculator:  the color, text, position relative to the individual
pad subwindows, value (digit or symbol), and type of pad.  The first window
in the list of data is the display window, where the entered values and
results are shown.  As you can see, the data for all the windows is
initialized, except for the color, which is set in initCalc.
None of these values change during the operation of the program except
the color and the value in the display window.The type member of windata indicates which of the four
major classes of pads the window fits in.  These are WTYP_CONVERSION,
WTYP_DIGIT, WTYP_OPERATOR, and WTYP_SPECIAL
and represent digits, operators, conversions (bases), and special keys.
The special keys are Clear All (CA), Clear Digit (CD), Clear Entry (CE),
and Unsigned (U).  Each pad within each type is identified with the
value member of windata.  For digits, this is the digit
itself, and for operators, conversions, and special keys, it is a symbol
representing each key.Last but not least, fgGC and bgGC are two GCs which
are used to save the colors between which the pads are changed.  The
pads have to change back and forth between black and white frequently,
and having one GC for each reduces the traffic to the server.Without further ado, LINKEND="EX-1002-14-10"Example 14-10

}The first action in this routine is to load the font.  The process
of loading and using a font should be familiar to you from the
discussion and examples in LINKEND="CH-1002-6-1"Chapter 6, "Drawing Graphics and Text."The routine then calls makePixmap to make pixmaps out of
the lgray and gray data in the include file.  This
routine calls XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData() to convert a
single-plane pixmap into a pixmap with depth suitable for tiling.
Then initCalc creates two GCs, each with a different
foreground color.  These are used later in drawButton.Now initCalc begins a loop through all the window data set up
in the array of structures called windata.  The first operation
within the loop is to adjust the position of text in each button according
to the font information.  Then the pad colors are set according to the
Base and Unsigned variables.  These variables have default
values (10 and U), but they may have been updated according to the command
line or the resource database.Finally, initCalc sets the color of the display window and the
current base pad.  If the base is not valid, this will not have been
caught until now, so the routine prints out a message and exits.

It also creates the icon pixmap from data and then uses it as the

tiled with this pixmap independent of the icon size.  Finally, all the
standard properties and window manager hints are set.There is nothing in makeWindows that you have not seen in

}The entire calculator window requires key events, because we want
to be able to operate the calculator from the keyboard as well as
with the pointer.The display window (dispWin) requires exposure events, because
it must be able to refresh itself for the usual reasons.All other windows (pads) require exposure events for refresh,
button events for selection, and border crossing events so that
the button only needs to be released within a pad to activate
the pad.  This last feature makes it easier to work quickly with
the calculator.

between two of your applications or between your application and
a proprietary window manager, you will need to write your own
routines to read and write properties.  Example 15-1 is

of security that can prevent connections from being made by clients
running on other machines.  First, to provide a minimal level of protection,
connections are only permitted from machines which are listed

XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 is similar to
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, but uses DES (Data

succeeds in connecting to the server.  Sometimes it is more
convenient (though less safe) to allow a client or any host
to have access.  In this case, a client running on the same host as
the server can call XDisableAccessControl().  Thereafter, the
host access list will no longer be used to filter connection requests.

ID="IX-1002-15-42"XQueryTree
of the window hierarchy with a single call.  This is the only way to
find out the IDs of windows created by other clients.  XQueryTree()
gets the root window ID, the parent window ID, and the list of child
window IDs given a window.  It also returns the number of children.One possible use of XQueryTree() is to find out whether your
application's top-level window has been reparented by the window

when the connection between the client and the server closes.  This
can happen without prior warning to either the server or the client
when, for example, the network cable is accidentally pulled out of
one of the machines or the machine running the server crashes.
Therefore, robust applications need a way of recovering from that
occurrence.  XSetCloseDownMode() helps implement one method
of recovery.Clients in the default DestroyAll close down mode will
ID="IX-1002-15-44"DestroyAll close mode
have all their resources killed when the connection to the server
dies.  XSetCloseDownMode() can set two other modes,
ID="IX-1002-15-45"XSetCloseDownModeRetainPermanent and RetainTemporary, which allow
client resources to live on for a time.  A client may want its
resources to live on to assist in the process of recovering from
a broken connection with the server, usually caused by a network
failure.  When next run after the problem has been corrected, the
application could somehow determine which resources were its own
and continue operating where it left off.  The "somehow" is the
crux of the problem.  The only way we can think of to allow the
client to find out the IDs of its resources after the client is
resurrected is for the client to save all the resource IDs in a
file (or perhaps in a property, but this would not survive a server
crash) immediately after they are created.  Then upon startup, it
can read this information and see if the specified resources still
exist.  If they do, it can skip creating them.A dying connection between the server and client raises other problems,
too.  Even if a client's resources are put on life support, there is
no longer any "brain" behind them.  The user's instructions will go
unanswered, and there will be no visible warning on the screen that the
client is no longer connected.  The window manager or some other program,
if running on the same machine as the server, could conceivably detect
this situation and print a message.  However, this kind of functionality
in a window manager has not been demonstrated up to now.  Otherwise,
the user can only be warned that the connection could die and that this
would cause the window to freeze (if the client's resources were preserved;
the window would disappear if the close down mode had not been set).  The
user could then restart the client from an xterm window to
reactivate the window.ID="IX-1002-15-46"killing client resourcesID="IX-1002-15-47"XKillClientXKillClient() can kill resources that remain alive after the
connection closes.  It can kill resources associated with a single

context manager and association tables.  The former saves you the trouble
of creating arrays and dynamically allocating memory for data to be used
only within your application.  The latter is a different way of doing the
same thing, maintained for backwards compatibility with X10.  We will
describe only the context manager.  If you are interested in
investigating association tables, see Appendix B, X10 Compatibility.ID="S2-1002-15-3"The Context ManagerID="IX-1002-15-62"contextmanagerFour routines are provided to let you associate data with a window
locally in Xlib, rather than in the server as in properties.  The
context manager routines store and retrieve untyped data according
to the display, a window ID, and an assigned context ID.  The display
argument to the context manager routine (returned from XOpenDisplay())
is used as an additional dimension to the array, not as a pointer to
the display structure.  No requests to the server are made.First, you call XUniqueContext() to obtain an ID for a particular
ID="IX-1002-15-63"XUniqueContext
type of information you want to assign to windows.  XUniqueContext()
just provides a unique integer ID every time you call it (you can also
make up your own if you wish).  This ID indicates to the application what
type of information is stored, but none of the calls require you to specify
the data type.  Then use XSaveContext() to store information into the
ID="IX-1002-15-64"XSaveContext
context manager and XFindContext() to read it.  If you plan to rewrite
ID="IX-1002-15-65"XFindContext
a particular piece of data corresponding to a window ID and context ID,
it is better in terms of time and space to erase the current entry with
XDeleteContext() before calling XSaveContext() again.
ID="IX-1002-15-66"XDeleteContextXDeleteContext() does not make the context ID invalid.If you have many different pieces of data of the same type, such
as an array, that must be associated with each window, you have
the option of packing it in a single chunk of data and storing it
by context or creating a different context ID for each member of
the array.  The context ID indicates the meaning of the data

standards, and portable across a wide variety of platforms.
While the goal of the ANSI-C and POSIX standards is portability,
many systems do not implement these standards, or do not implement
them fully, so the MIT R5 distribution defines new header files that
attempt to mask the differences between systems.
The header files are <X11/Xfuncproto.h>, <X11/Xfuncs.h>,
<X11/Xosdefs.h>, and <X11/Xos.h>.
None of these files are part of the official R5 standard, so
they may not be shipped with your system.  But they
can be very useful in writing portable applications, so we
have included them with the code from this book, which you can
get as described in the Preface.LINKEND="FN-1002-15-1"ID="FN-1002-15-1"The sections below have been adapted from the X

describe a system's support for ANSI-C and POSIX.
Symbols that describe a system's support for other
standards may be added in the future.  It defines two
new symbols, X_NOT_STDC_ENV and
X_NOT_POSIX, for systems that do not have the
ANSI-C and POSIX header files, respectively.  When
standard header files exist, your code should include
them.  On systems which do not have them, however,
attempting to include them would cause a compilation
error.  The symbols in <X11/Xosdefs.h> allow you
to write code that takes the right action in either
situation.  Note that X_NOT_STDC_ENV is
ID="IX-1002-15-85"__STDC__
different from __STDC__, which simply
indicates whether or not the compiler supports ANSI-C.An example of using X_NOT_STDC_ENV might be to
know when the system declares getenv:ID="SC-1002-15-2"#ifndef X_NOT_STDC_ENV
#include <stdlib.h>#else

It is convention in the R5 code from MIT is to put the
standard case first using #ifndef.Lack of the symbol X_NOT_STDC_ENV does notID="IX-1002-15-88"stdarg.h
mean that the system has <stdarg.h>.  This header
file is part of ANSI-C, but the X Consortium found it
more useful to check for it separately because many
systems have all the ANSI-C files except this one.  The
symbol __STDC__ is used to control inclusion
of this file.ID="IX-1002-15-89"POSIXheader filesX_NOT_POSIX means the system does not have POSIX.1 header files.
Lack of this symbol does not mean that the POSIX environment is
ID="IX-1002-15-90"_POSIX_SOURCE
the default.  You may still have to define _POSIX_SOURCE before
including the header file to get POSIX definitions.An example of using X_NOT_POSIX might be to
determine what return type would be declared for
getuid in <pwd.h>:ID="SC-1002-15-3"#include <pwd.h>#ifndef X_NOT_POSIX
    uid_t uid;
#else
    int uid;
    extern int getuid();
#endif
    uid = getuid();Note that both X_NOT_STDC_ENV and
X_NOT_POSIX, when declared, state a
noncompliance.  This was chosen so that porting to a
new, standard platform would be easier.  Only
non-standard platforms need to add themselves to
<X11/Xosdefs.h> to turn on the appropriate
symbols.Not all systems for which the X Consortium leaves these symbols
undefined strictly adhere to the relevant standards.
Thus you will sometimes see checks for a specific
operating system
near a check for one of the Xosdefs.h symbols.
The X Consortium found it most useful to label systems
as conforming even if they had some holes in their
compliance.  Presumably these holes will become fewer

original window size.  Look at the X application resize, which makes
changes to TERMCAP.  The resize reference page (see Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide) suggests
a couple of C shell aliases for commands to resize xterm windows.If you have a Berkeley 4.3-compatible tty driver, xterm sets
the tty driver's row and column attributes when its top-level window
is resized. vi and more and several other programs also
look at those attributes when figuring out the terminal size.  Also,
xterm will send a SIGWINCH signal to the controlling process,
ID="IX-1002-15-132"SIGWINCH signal
which, if it is vi or more, will understand this signal
and change its own notion of screen size, repainting the window in

under xterm.Graphics programs face a more difficult porting path.  They must be
rewritten to use the X library.  It is a good idea to use a toolkit
rather than trying to write completely in Xlib.Programs written for single-user systems such as PCs will be a
little more difficult, since they must be converted to respond

vendor has provided for use on a particular machine, in addition
to the standard X library.Extensions to X are not second-class citizens, and there should be
very little to distinguish the use of an extension from that of the
core protocol.  The only difference is that the application should
check to make sure the extension exists and then query the extension
to find out the major opcode, additional event types, and additional
error types so that the extension can be integrated properly.  If the
extensions have been written properly so that they initialize themselves
when first called, they should be usable just like other X library functions.XListExtensions() returns a list of all extensions supported
ID="IX-1002-15-139"XListExtensions
by the server.  Once the name of the desired extension is known,
XQueryExtension() should be called to get specific information
ID="IX-1002-15-140"XQueryExtension
about the extension.  XFreeExtensionList() should then be used
ID="IX-1002-15-141"XFreeExtensionList
to free the memory allocated by XListExtensions().
ID="IX-1002-15-142"XListExtensionsThe standard extensions as of this writing are the Shape extension,
which supports non-rectangular windows, the X Input extension, which
supports input devices other than the single mouse and keyboard normally
connected to an X server, and PEX, a 3-D graphics extension.  All
extensions are optional, however.  Only the Shape extension is
available in virtually all X servers as of this writing.ID="CH-1002-16-1" NUMBER="16"Window ManagementWindow ManagementX programs may be expected to cooperate with any one of a number of
different window managers.  This chapter discusses the design of a
simple window manager, not so you will be able to write one but so
you will know what to expect from one.  As it turns out, some of the
techniques used in this program (such as menus) could be adapted for
other clients as well.  Everyone should at least look through this
chapter.ID="IX-1002-16-1" SPAN="START"window managementID="IX-1002-16-2" SPAN="START"window managerID="IX-1002-16-3"window managerdefinitionA window manager is a program implemented with Xlib to control
the layout of windows on the screen, responding to user requests
to move, resize, raise, lower, or iconify windows.  The window
manager may also enforce a policy for window layout (such as
mandating a standard window or icon size and placement) and
provide a menu for commonly used shell commands.This chapter is not primarily for window manager writers, as these
are a rare breed.  There are several good customizable window managers
available, and there is very little reason for users or application
writers to want to write their own.  Only a few people in the X community
are going to be actively involved in writing window managers, and chances
are good they will already know all of what is described here.  This
chapter is presented for two reasons:  so that application writers will
get a better understanding of how to cooperate with the window manager,
and so we can describe and demonstrate the Xlib routines that are provided
mainly for the purpose of window management.  As it turns out, the
examples in this chapter also have elements (such as menus) that could be
useful in ordinary applications as well.We'll begin by describing the features and routines in Xlib that are
provided mainly to give window managers the authority they need to
control window layout and the flexibility to provide a good user
interface.  These features include the following:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-16-4"substructure redirectiondefinitionSubstructure redirection, which allows the window manager to intercept
requests to change the screen layout.  This enables a window manager to
enforce a window layout policy.ID="IX-1002-16-5"reparentingdefinitionReparenting, which lets the window manager build a frame or other
"decoration" around each top-level window.  The frame could possibly
contain boxes which could be used to move or resize the window.ID="IX-1002-16-6"save-setdefinitionThe save-set, which ensures that the windows the window manager iconifies
or reparents are returned to their original state if the window manager
dies unexpectedly.Then we'll describe what the window manager can do with the properties
set by clients, building on the description of interclient communication
ID="IX-1002-16-7"interclient communication
presented in LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."Finally, we'll describe a simple window manager program.  You should
find this program helpful not only in demonstrating window management
techniques but also for showing Xlib
programming in a more complex
setting than

before tackling this one.ID="S1-1002-16-1"Layout PolicyID="IX-1002-16-8"layout policywindow managerID="IX-1002-16-9"window managerlayout policyA window manager may have a policy on how top-level windows will be
placed on the screen.ID="IX-1002-16-10"window manageruwmID="IX-1002-16-11"window managertwmID="IX-1002-16-12"uwm window managerID="IX-1002-16-13"twm window manager
The standard window managers uwm and twm do not have a
window layout policy, but some existing window managers do.  For
example, the Siemens RTL Tiled window manager mandates that only
temporary pop-up windows can overlap.  That policy makes exposure
a rare occurrence but makes resizing much more common.  A second
simpler example is the window manager designed by Stellar Computer
for its high performance workstations.  The Stellar window manager
aligns icons along the top edge of the screen, along with the
Stellar logo.  Since the window manager creates the icons or is
passed their IDs through hints, it can distinguish them from other
windows on the screen.Within its window layout policy, the window manager should honor the
window size and position hints returned by XGetNormalHints()
and XGetWMHints() as closely as possible (each application sets
these hints).  Under uwm and twm, the user selects the
size of a newly created window by moving a flashing outline of a
window.  The size hints provided by the application determine the
minimum dimensions, maximum dimensions, and desired increment for
the window size, and these are indicated in the motion of the outline.
For example, in both uwm and twm, the minimum size hints
take priority over the user's input, so that the user cannot resize
the window smaller than the minimum size.Applications are free to resize or move the children of their
top-level windows as necessary.  The window manager has no control
over these windows.ID="S1-1002-16-2"Substructure RedirectionID="IX-1002-16-14" SPAN="START"substructure redirectionID="IX-1002-16-15"structuresredirectionID="IX-1002-16-16"redirectionsubstructureID="IX-1002-16-17"redirectionof window configuration requestsThe window manager enforces its window layout policy using
substructure redirection.  When the window manager selects
SubstructureRedirectMask on the root window, an
attempt by any other client to change the configuration of
any child of the root window will fail.  Instead an event
describing the layout change request will be sent to the
window manager.  The window manager then reads the event and
determines whether to honor the request, modify it, or deny
it completely.  If it decides to honor the request, it calls
the routine that the client called that triggered the event
with the same arguments.  If it decides to modify the request,
it calls the same routine but with modified arguments.The structure, as the term is used here, is the location,
size, stacking order, border width, and mapping status of a window.
The substructure is all these statistics about the children
of a particular window.  This is the complete set of information
about screen layout that the window manager might need in order to
implement its policy.  Redirection means that an event is
sent to the client selecting redirection (usually the window manager),
and the original structure-changing request is not executed.The events that are selected by SubstructureRedirectMask
and the routines that are intercepted are as follows:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-16-18"CirculateRequest eventID="IX-1002-16-19"eventsCirculateRequestCirculateRequest events report when an Xlib function, such

the only time that a configuration request on a child of the root
window is not intercepted is when the override_redirect
attribute of that child window has been set to True.  This
is intended for temporary pop-up windows that should not be reparented
or affected by the window manager's layout policy.Only one window manager at a time can select SubstructureRedirectMask
or ResizeRedirectMask on a particular window.ResizeRedirectMask also selects ConfigureRequest
events when a client has called XConfigureWindow(),
XMoveResizeWindow(), or XResizeWindow().  However, if
any client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on the
parent of the window for which ResizeRedirectMask is
selected, the SubstructureRedirectMask takes precedence.Substructure redirect allows the window manager to separate the
portion of itself that moves and resizes windows from the portion
that enforces window policy.  While the window reconfiguration section
is driven by user events, the policy section can be completely driven
from the *Request events that signal that the user has proposed
a change to the window layout.  And since applications will only attempt
to resize or move their top-level windows in direct response to a user
request, those requests are just as valid as the ones from the window
reconfiguration section of the window manager.

and place little boxes on the titlebar with which the window can
be moved or resized.  This is only one possibility, modeled on the
user interface on the Macintosh‘.To do this, the window manager creates a child of the root somewhat
larger than the top-level window of the application.  Then it calls
XReparentWindow(), specifying the top-level window of the
ID="IX-1002-16-37"XReparentWindow
application as win and the new parent as parent.
win and all its descendants will then be descendants of
parent.In the area where the new parent is visible around the top-level
window of the application, the window manager can put anything it
wants.  This could include text, graphics, and small windows which
perform certain functions when a button is clicked in them.The window manager can decorate all top-level windows, but it will
normally ignore windows that are mapped with their override_redirect
attribute set, since no *Request events will be generated for
them.  The window manager may also decorate differently windows that
have set the XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property and apply its
window layout policy to them.  The window manager calls
XGetTransientForHint() for each window to get this property.By the way, it is impossible (except by luck) for the window manager
to match the colors of the decoration to the colors of the window it
is decorating.  A window manager cannot find out what colors a window
uses for its border or background because these window attributes
cannot be queried.ID="S2-1002-16-1"ShadowsID="IX-1002-16-38"shadow decorationID="IX-1002-16-39"window managershadow decorationWindow shadows can be imperfectly implemented by reparenting

the window manager dies, all windows listed in the save-set will be
reparented back to their closest living ancestor if they were reparented
in the first place and mapped if the window manager has unmapped them
so that it could map an icon.The save-set is necessary because the window manager might not exit
normally.  The user might kill it with CTRL-C if it is running in
the foreground, or more likely, the user might get the process number
and kill it.  Actually, the actions of the save-set are performed
even if the window manager exits normally, so less code is needed
since the save-set does the cleaning up.Window managers almost always place in the save-set all the windows
they reparent or iconify, using XAddToSaveSet().
ID="IX-1002-16-44"XAddToSaveSetWindows are automatically removed from the save-set when they are

in Appendix L, Interclient Communcation Conventions,

ID="IX-1002-16-132"XGrabServerID="IX-1002-16-133"XUngrabServer
program requires total control of the screen, so that output
requests from other programs are queued but not displayed.  One
application of grabbing is to draw temporary moving objects on
the screen, such as the outline of a window being moved.  This
is called rubber-banding.
ID="IX-1002-16-134"rubber-banding
The outline (or grid) is drawn with logical function GXxor,
which, when drawn twice, leaves the screen as it was initially.  If
the server were not grabbed in between the first drawing and the
second of the same line, some other program might update the same
part of the display, resulting in glitches after the second drawing.
This server grab also speeds up the rubber-banding, because the
server stops performing updates to other windows.ID="S1-1002-16-7"A Basic Window ManagerID="IX-1002-16-135" SPAN="START"window managerwinman exampleID="IX-1002-16-136"winmanexample programThis section describes the design of a simple window manager called
winman.  This example window manager should be helpful in several
ways.  It demonstrates many of the Xlib routines that are intended to
be used only by window managers.  It also shows what a window manager
might do with the properties that applications set and how window
managers implement icons.  This window manager also demonstrates the
use of the save-set to make sure that, if it dies, the windows it
has iconified will be restored.  It does not, however, demonstrate
substructure redirection or reparenting.  See the code for
twm for examples of substructure redirection and reparenting.The winman program also demonstrates some techniques that may be
helpful in ordinary applications, such as how to implement a menu using
Xlib.  (Most applications will ultimately do this with a toolkit.)

If you have the example programs from O'Reilly and Associates, you can
compile and run winman to see how it works (how to get this code
is described in the Preface).  Be sure to stop or kill any other
window managers running before running winman.  Both winman
and the other window manager may get confused because they are not
designed to cooperate with each other.  The following explanations
will be easier to follow if you have used the program.ID="S2-1002-16-5"Operation of the ProgramID="IX-1002-16-141"winmanhow it worksID="IX-1002-16-142"winmanmenuThe winman program creates a menu composed of horizontal bars
and places it in the upper-right corner of the screen, as shown
in Figure 16-4.ID="FG-1002-16-4"The menu created by winmanFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="fig.16.04.gif" ID="GC-1002-16-7"ID="IX-1002-16-143"winmaninput forThe menu provides a number of basic functions for manipulating
windows on the screen:RaiseBrings a window to the top of the stack, so that it is fully visible.LowerLowers a window to the bottom so that the area formerly hidden
is made visible.MoveChanges the position of a window on the screen, and raises it.ResizeChanges the size of a window, and raises it.CirculateDnMoves the window on the bottom to the top.CirculateUpMoves the window on the top to the bottom.(De)IconifyTurns a window into a small marker window or vice versa.Keybrd FocusAssigns all keyboard input to the selected window, regardless of
the position of the pointer.New XtermCreates a new xterm window, and places it at the upper-left
corner of the screen.  You can subsequently move or resize the new
window with the Move and Resize functions.ExitIt is good practice for all programs to provide a way to quit.
(uwm requires the user to look up the process number and
kill the process.)  Since this window manager is primarily for
demonstration purposes, this choice is provided to make it easy
to kill the program.ID="IX-1002-16-144"winmanuser interfaceAll input for the window manager is supplied through the pointer.
A cursor (which tracks the pointer) is assigned to the menu to
indicate that input in this area selects a menu item.  Choices
ID="IX-1002-16-145"winmanhow to make menu choice
are made from the menu by pressing a pointer button in the
appropriate region of the menu.  When a menu choice is made,
the menu bar and its label change to inverse video.  In other words,
everything that was black in the bar changes to white and vice versa
(winman works in black and white on all systems, even those
with color).  After the choice is made but before the operation is
complete, the pointer is grabbed, so that all pointer input is
directed to the menu window independent of the position of the
pointer.  While the pointer is grabbed, winman's
cursor changes to a hand and tracks the pointer anywhere on the
screen.  This reminds you that the window manager is expecting
the next pointer input even though the pointer is no longer on
the menu.  When the chosen operation is complete, the menu is
returned to its initial condition, and the pointer grab is released.
If this menu was to be used in a normal application, a passive
grab would be used instead of the active one used here.
ID="IX-1002-16-146"winmanfunctionsIf CirculateDn, CirculateUp, or New Xterm is chosen, selection
of a window is not necessary.  The circulation operations act
on all overlapping windows that are children of the root.  The
New Xterm choice simply creates a new xterm window.If Raise, Lower, (De)Iconify or Kybrd Focus is chosen, the user
must press a pointer button to select a window.  (winman's
own menu cannot be iconified, because this would make it impossible
to recover the window manager menu.)  Kybrd Focus sets the keyboard
focus window and highlights that window with a white background
behind the window.If Move or Resize is chosen, the user must press a pointer button
on the window to be manipulated, drag the pointer with the button
held until the outline of the window is in the chosen size or
position, and then release the button.  (winman's own menu
can be moved but not resized.)  A moving outline of the window is
used to indicate the intended dimensions or position of the window.ID="S2-1002-16-6"Description of the Code of mainID="IX-1002-16-147" SPAN="START"mainof winmanExample 16-1 shows the main for the winman

the windows that contain each menu item.  It would be possible to
write a menu that only used one window, placing the text within
the window in the right places and highlighting areas when the
pointer coordinates in the ButtonPress events indicated
that an item was chosen.  This is a hard way, because it does not
take advantage of X's windowing capabilities.  It would also be
possible to make each menu panel a subwindow of the root window.
While this would simplify the event handling and highlighting,
we would have to define a cursor for each of the windows.  More
importantly, the user would have to move all the windows separately
if the menu were to be moved, unless we monitored movement of any
one of the windows and made the rest follow.  There are also other
ramifications, including that it would be difficult to identify
the menu as a whole to make sure it was not iconified; this would
require comparing the IDs in events with the IDs of all the windows.
The best solution is a combination of the above approaches.The menu is created by superimposing ten small InputOutput
child windows (defs[]) on one large InputOutput
parent window (menuwin), as shown in Figure 16-5.  This
has the advantage that there is a single parent window for the
window manager, which we can use to locate the panes of the menu
and to identify the menu as a whole.
ID="IX-1002-16-155"cursorassigning
You can also assign a cursor to the larger window, and since
the smaller windows are its children, the same cursor appears
in all of them.  This avoids nine cursor assignments.The nine smaller windows do three other convenient things; their
borders make a neat division between areas of the menu, they

define a convenient area to invert from black on white to white

it is time to plan what events are going to be needed.  The
menuwin window requires no events, since it is chiefly
there to tie together the menu panes.  ButtonPress,
ButtonRelease, and Expose events are required
for the panes, so they can accept a choice and redraw the pane
in case anything obscures and then exposes part or all of the menu.
ButtonRelease events are selected so that we can verify
menu choices by making sure the
ButtonRelease happens
in the same window as the ButtonPress.  Since the pointer
is grabbed during the selection of a window on the screen to be
ID="IX-1002-16-158"winmanpointer grabbing
manipulated (a window not associated with the window manager), we
do not need to select input on any of these windows.  However, we
need to know when applications that winman has iconified
have been killed, so that we can remove the icon.  This requires
selecting SubstructureNotifyMask on the root window.Some of the other events selected by SubstructureNotifyMaskID="IX-1002-16-159"SubstructureNotifyMask
also come in handy for triggering the redrawing of the highlighting
background drawn around the focus window by winman.  This
background is drawn on the root window and might have to be redrawn
whenever a new area of the root window becomes exposed.  It has to
be redrawn when CirculateNotify, ConfigureNotify, or
ID="IX-1002-16-160"CirculateNotify eventID="IX-1002-16-161"ConfigureNotify eventID="IX-1002-16-162"eventsCirculateNotifyID="IX-1002-16-163"eventsConfigureNotifyUnmapNotify events arrive.  This could also have been done
ID="IX-1002-16-164"UnmapNotify eventID="IX-1002-16-165"eventsUnmapNotify
by selecting Expose events on the root window, but since we
have already selected these other events and they will be sent from
the server to Xlib anyway, it improves performance slightly to use
them instead of Expose events on the root window.ID="S2-1002-16-9"Handling InputID="IX-1002-16-166"inputreceivingThere are numerous commands available for getting input.  The
routines used in main are XCheckTypedEvent(),
ID="IX-1002-16-167"XCheckTypedEventXMaskEvent(), and XNextEvent().
ID="IX-1002-16-168"XMaskEventID="IX-1002-16-169"XNextEventXCheckTypedEvent()ID="IX-1002-16-170"XCheckTypedEventAllows you to choose the types of events to look for, monitors all

until an event arrives.These routines were described and most of them demonstrated
in LINKEND="CH-1002-8-1"Chapter 8, "Events," and LINKEND="CH-1002-9-1"Chapter 9, "The Keyboard and Pointer."  But
the way they are used in main might need some explanation.
Consider the excerpt from main shown in Example 16-2.

}ID="IX-1002-16-175"event typeshandlingID="IX-1002-16-176"inputhandlingHere we have already read a ButtonPress event and are
waiting for a ButtonRelease on the same button.  This
cannot be done with XMaskEvent() alone, because we might
get a ButtonRelease on a different button first and
there is no way to select or get only the button events on a
single button (except by writing a predicate procedure as shown
in Example 8-6).  Therefore, XMaskEvent() is called
in a loop, and the button member in each event must be checked.
Furthermore, the CheckTypedEvent calls are necessary to make
sure that Xlib's queue does not fill up with ButtonPress or
ButtonRelease events that are not wanted, since the code is
really waiting for a particular button release.  XCheckTypedEvent()
is used again in the routine that actually moves or resizes a window
to throw away excess MotionNotify events.

The Expose event processing in main redraws
winman's menu only when the count field in the
Expose event is zero, thus responding only to the last
Expose event in a contiguous series on a single window.
Remember that any of the menu panes or any icon can receive
Expose events.  We also minimize redrawing by redrawing
only the panes that are exposed.ID="S2-1002-16-10"Inverting an AreaID="IX-1002-16-182"XCopyAreaID="IX-1002-16-183"inverting an areaID="IX-1002-16-184"areasinvertingID="IX-1002-16-185"copying areasID="IX-1002-16-186"highlightingID="IX-1002-16-187"monochrome displayhighlightingID="IX-1002-16-188"colorhighlightingThere are at least four possible strategies for inverting
a menu pane containing text.  They are not all equally good.One is to use XCopyArea() to copy the pane to itself using
GXinvert as the logical function in the GC.  This approach
ID="IX-1002-16-189"GXinvert logical functionID="IX-1002-16-190"logical functionsGXinvert
is weak because GXinvert would not achieve the desired
effect on a color system, even though it would work fine on a
monochrome system.The second strategy, adopted in main, is to change the
background pixel value of the window and change the foreground
pixel value in the GC to draw the text in a contrasting color.
In winman, the colors are black and white, but this approach
will work correctly with any two contrasting colors.The third approach would be to use XDrawImageString() to draw
ID="IX-1002-16-191"XDrawImageStringfor highlightingID="IX-1002-16-192"highlightingwith XDrawImageString
the text.  XDrawImageString() draws a complete rectangle, with
the text in the foreground pixel value from the GC and the rest of
the rectangle in the background pixel value.  If this rectangle were
the same size as the menu pane, the entire pane could be inverted in
color simply by swapping the foreground and background pixel values
in the GC.  The one weakness of this approach is that the rectangle
drawn by XDrawImageString() might not leave as much space around
the text as you would like.  However, this is a very fast approach,
useful in menus and for the selection of text, which works in both
monochrome and color.The fourth approach involves a trick using colors allocated by
XAllocColorCells().  It is possible to allocate colors so
ID="IX-1002-16-193"XAllocColorCellshighlighting with
that the two contrasting colors in the drawable are swapped by
ID="IX-1002-16-194"drawableswapping contrasting colors in
setting to 1 or 0 all the bits in a plane of the drawable.  In this
technique, the text does not need drawing at all for highlighting,
because the plane on which the text is drawn is not modified by
the operation to set or clear the bits in the other plane.  You
would need to allocate four colorcells, two of which contained
the foreground RGB values and two the background.  This would not
work on a monochrome system, since you could not allocate four
colorcells.  This technique is described in LINKEND="S2-1002-7-15"Section 7.5.2, "Allocating Read/Write Colorcells for Overlays."ID="S2-1002-16-11"CursorsThe main creates two cursors:  one an arrow for selecting
from the menu, and the other a hand for manipulating windows.  It
uses the call to grab the pointer to change the cursor to the hand.
That has the nice side effect that the cursor will automatically
change back when the grab is released, so that the cursor
window attribute does not need to be changed with XDefineCursor().ID="S2-1002-16-12"Grabbing the PointerID="IX-1002-16-195"pointersgrabbingID="IX-1002-16-196"grabbingpointersID="IX-1002-16-197"XGrabPointerXGrabPointer() is called to allow the user to select a
window anywhere on the screen to be manipulated.  While the
pointer is grabbed, all pointer input is sent to the menu.
Note that keyboard input is still sent normally to the
application the pointer is in.The arguments of XGrabPointer() can be confusing.  The
owner_events argument affects the distribution of events
when the pointer is within this application's windows.  Therefore,
it does not affect our application, because we are using the grab to
get input from outside the menu windows.  The pointer_mode
and keyboard_mode arguments also do not apply to the job
at hand, so they are set to GrabModeAsync, which does not
ID="IX-1002-16-198"GrabModeAsyncgrabbingID="IX-1002-16-199"grabbingGrabModeAsync
affect the processing of events.  Their other settings cause events
to be held in the server until a releasing XAllowEvents() call.
ID="IX-1002-16-200"XAllowEvents
Finally, the confine_to argument also does not fit our job,
ID="IX-1002-16-201"confine_to grab argumentID="IX-1002-16-202"grabbingconfine_to
because we want the pointer to be able to roam around the screen
rather than be confined to a window.That about wraps up the new techniques used in main that
have not been used earlier in this manual.  Now we'll move on to
some of the routines that main calls, beginning with

displays text in a menu pane.  It
is called when an exposure event occurs on a pane.  When the menu
is exposed, all of the exposure events are sent contiguously,
refreshing each of the panes that was exposed.  When the menu is
first mapped, the Expose events trigger the drawing of
all the panes for the first time.ID="IX-1002-16-205"winmanchoice windowsEach call of this routine draws the text in one choice window.
The first operation compares the window ID from the event with
the IDs in the panes array to determine which string
from the menu_label array to use.Window backgrounds are automatically redrawn by the server when
exposure occurs.  But paint_pane is not always called in
response to Expose events; it is also used to invert the pane
when a choice is made.  Therefore, the request buffer will not
necessarily be flushed before the next call to draw the area.
Therefore, an XClearWindow() call is necessary to redraw
the background.  (A completely different strategy could have been
used.  The background could be filled with XFillRectangle()
instead of using the server.)ID="EX-1002-16-3"winman -- the paint_pane routinestatic char *menu_label[] = {

a GC and draws a box.  It raises some interesting issues since it
draws on the root window.  It is called from the simple window
manager program winman described in LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management."  Its
purpose is to draw an outline of a window during the rubber-banding
that shows the user the current size or position of a window being
resized or moved.  The program also calls this routine to erase the
box and to redraw the box to show the current position or size of
a window as it is moved.ID="EX-1002-16-7"The draw_box routineDisplay *display;
int screen;

   /* Set foreground pixel value -- default may be white on white */
   XSetForeground(display, gc, BlackPixel(display,screen));

   XSetSubwindowMode(display, gc, IncludeInferiors);
   /* Logical function is XOR, so that double drawing erases box

   XSetFunction(display, gc, GXxor);
   XDrawRectangle(display, RootWindow(display,screen), gc, x, y,
         width, height);
}This routine uses a couple of tricks that need explanation.  Notice
that three elements of the GC are changed and that the drawing request
draws on the root window.  Since the box may be moved anywhere on the
screen during a move operation (by the window manager), the box must
be drawn on the root window.  We set the foreground color to black
so that the box will be visible over the default backgrounds of most
windows (white).  By default, the subwindow_mode member is set
to ClipByChildren, specifying that graphics drawn to a window
do not show through child windows.  Because we want the entire box to
be visible anywhere on the screen, we set the subwindow_mode
to IncludeInferiors.We are using a logical operation of GXxor so that the box can
be drawn again to erase itself.  This logical operation has the unique
feature of returning the pixels to their original state in monochrome
or color if the box is drawn twice, as long as none of the pixels were
changed between the first and second drawings.  To make sure nothing
else is drawn in between, the program that calls draw_box grabs
the server for the
brief period of the window manipulation.
Avoid grabbing the server unless absolutely necessary.ID="S2-1002-16-18"(De)Iconifying WindowsID="IX-1002-16-228"winmanicon routineID="IX-1002-16-229"iconsroutineThe iconify routine must be able to turn a window into an
icon or turn an icon back into a window.  It is completely up to
the window manager to keep track of the association between windows
and icons.  Therefore, a substantial portion of winman's code
is devoted to maintaining a list of the main windows and their
associated icon windows.  We will look at the code for the routine
that main calls, iconify, and then delve into the
details of implementing icons.Example 16-8 shows the iconify routine that is

}If the window is not an icon, the window is unmapped and an icon
window is created and mapped.  If the window is an icon, it is
ID="IX-1002-16-230"iconsimplementing
unmapped and the associated main window is remapped.  The
iconify routine guards against iconifying the menu,
since there is no way in this program to undo that operation.The iconify routine calls the isIcon routine.
If the window selected is not an icon, isIcon creates
an icon window, enters it into a linked list, and returns the
icon window's ID.  If the window selected is an icon, the
associated main window's ID is returned.  Either way, the
window selected is unmapped and the associated window is mapped.The routines underlying isIcon are a simplified version of
the icon-handling code from uwm.  Notice that these routines
are in a separate source file, so they must include the standard
include files and declare as extern the global variables

isIcon returns True.If win is found and it is a main window, isIcon
returns False.If win is not found at all, isIcon calls
makeIcon to create an icon for the window and then calls
XAddToSaveSet() to add the window to winman's save-set.
This code only gets called when an application is being iconified
for the first time.  Since it is possible that winman will
get killed before it has a chance to remap the main windows of the
applications it has iconified, these windows must be automatically
remapped when winman dies.  That is what the save-set does.
(winman can be killed by typing CTRL-C in the window it
was invoked from if it has been run in the foreground or with the
Exit choice from winman's menu.)ID="S2-1002-16-19"Creating the IconsThe makeIcon routine called in isIcon is used
to read the hints that the application has specified for the
icon.  As you will recall, the window manager has the option of
honoring or ignoring these hints.  winman honors them to
the greatest extent possible.  It allows an application to specify
an icon pixmap or icon window, an icon name, and the icon's position.If some or all of these hints are not set, winman does the
best it can.  If no icon window is specified, winman creates
one.  If no icon pixmap is specified, winman uses a white
background and writes the icon name on it in black.ID="EX-1002-16-10"winman -- the makeIcon routineWindow makeIcon(window, x, y, icon_name_return)

and determine a size for the icon from the name, given the font
dimensions.  If no icon name is available, they use the program
name, and if that is not available, they use the string "Icon."However, this should never happen if the applications are written
properly.ID="S2-1002-16-21"Updating the Icon ListNow we'll turn to finishIcon, which is called from
makeIcon.  finishIcon creates and defines a cursor
for the icon, selects Expose events for it, and updates the
linked list of structures to include the new icon and its associated
window.  (Actually, the cursor should have been created in another
routine, because here it is executed every time a new icon is created.)ID="EX-1002-16-12"winman -- the finishIcon routineWindow finishIcon(window, icon, own, icon_name)

   win_list->next = Icons;
   Icons = win_list;
   return(icon);
}One nice user interface possibility is suggested by the code for
finishIcon.  We could let the user turn an icon back into
a main window by pressing some key or button in the icon.  To do
this, we would select button or key events on the icon and then
look for them in one of the event loops in main.  If
button events were chosen, we would need to identify which window
the button event appeared in to distinguish between events from
the menu and events in the icon, but this would be easy.ID="S2-1002-16-22"Removing IconsFinally, we need a way to remove icons for applications that have
been iconified but exit while the window manager is running.  The
main selects StructureNotifyMask to be notified
when top-level windows are destroyed and responds by calling
removeIcon, which is shown in Example 16-13.ID="EX-1002-16-13"winman -- the removeIcon routineremoveIcon(window)

            };
   }
}Whether winman exits graciously (through the Exit choice
on the menu) or by being killed, all the main windows it has
iconified have already been placed in the save-set, so that
they will automatically be mapped.  Therefore, no routine to
clear the icons is necessary.ID="S2-1002-16-23"Changing Keyboard FocusID="IX-1002-16-231"winmanfocus routineID="IX-1002-16-232"focus windowkeyboardID="IX-1002-16-233"XSetInputFocusSetting the keyboard focus allows the user to stop worrying

The underlying function here is XSetInputFocus().  It

of the border and drawing a white outline around the window.
This is necessary because it would not be obvious which application
had the focus unless the application itself was programmed to
indicate when it has the focus.  Of course, applying the keyboard
focus to a window that does not use keyboard input, like the main
window of xclock, would cause your input to be just thrown
away and the only indication of what is happening would be the
highlighting drawn around the focus window.ID="IX-1002-16-236"winmanfocus routineID="IX-1002-16-237"focus windowchangingID="IX-1002-16-238"keyboard focus windowchangingID="IX-1002-16-239"XSetInputFocusID="IX-1002-16-240"XQueryPointer
The focus routine in LINKEND="EX-1002-16-14"Example 16-14
 selects a window much like the
raise_lower function does.  If the subwindow returned by
XQueryPointer() is NULL, the pointer must be on the
root window, and the focus can be set to the ID of the root window.
Otherwise we need to find out if the subwindow is an icon.  The
focus should be on the real window as opposed to the icon, since
the icon is controlled by the window manager and does not accept
keyboard input for the application.To change the border width of the new focus window, we need to get the
old width with XGetWindowAttributes(), and save it so it can

further highlight the focus window.  There are several ways
to do this, ranging from almost trivial to fairly complex.
The easiest way is to change the border width and/or color to
indicate which window is the focus.  Another way is to draw on
the root window behind the focus window.  This has a slightly
different effect in that no highlight would appear on windows
where they did not contact the root window.  We do both to be
absolutely sure the current focus window is well indicated.  The
window is highlighted by increasing its border width and by tiling
a region underneath the current focus window with a pixmap.A third and more complicated way is to reparent the focus window
into a background frame, as described above in LINKEND="S1-1002-16-3"Section 16.3, "Reparenting."
This would work well if the windows already had been reparented
to add a titlebar.ID="IX-1002-16-243"pixmapscreatingThe draw_focus_frame routine shown in Example 16-15

}There is some code in main that helps execute do
its thing.  It makes sure that the new process does not inherit
any open files from the parent process, our window manager.
Without this call, the child process might affect the operation
of the client instead of being completely separate.  All routines
that execute shell commands should include the code shown
in Example 16-17 in the routine that calls execute.

This chapter explains the font service architecture
and the use of the scalable fonts.  Font service is
entirely transparent to the X programmer--it is
impossible for the programmer to tell whether a given
font came from a font server or from a font file read
by the X server.  Although there are no new functions
or datatypes related to font service, the architecture
overview and font server configuration information
may be of interest.This appendix describes how to specify fonts in application code or in
resource files.  For all the details on the conventions for font

Since Release 3, Adobe Systems, Inc. and Digital Equipment Corporation
have jointly contributed several families of screen fonts (Courier, Helvetica,
New Century Schoolbook, Symbol, and Times) in a variety of sizes, styles,
and weights for 75-dots-per-inch (dpi) monitors.  Bitstream, Inc. contributed
its Charter font family in the same sizes, styles, and weights for both
75- and 100-dpi monitors.  Since Release 4, Bigelow and Holmes,
Inc. and Sun Microsystems, Inc. have contributed the Lucida font
family and DEC contributed a new terminal emulator font.
Since Release 5, Bitstream has contributed several outline fonts to
match their contributed bitmap fonts.
ID="IX-1002-A-9"fontsfamilies ofFonts are stored in three directories:COLUMNS="2"LEFT="0" WIDTH="117"DirectoryLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"ContentsLEFT="0" WIDTH="117"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/miscLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"Several fixed-width fonts, the cursor fontLEFT="0" WIDTH="117"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpiLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"Fixed- and variable-width fonts, 75 dots per inchLEFT="0" WIDTH="117"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpiLEFT="125" WIDTH="356"Fixed- and variable-width fonts, 100 dots per inchLBL="A-1"Table A-1   These three directories (in this order) comprise X's default font path.
The font path can be changed with the fp option to the xset
client, as described in Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide.  The font path, together with a great deal
of other information about the server defaults, can be listed with xset
query.
All fonts in the font path can be listed with xlsfonts,
and the characters in a font can be displayed on the screen with xfd.In R5 and later, the font path can include font servers.An application can modify the font path using XSetFontPath(), to
add font directories or font servers.
This should be done carefully to make sure the existing
font directories are still searched.The name of each font file in the font directories has a filename extension
of .snf, which stands for server natural format.
In R4, fonts were distributed in binary distribution format
(bdf), which needs to be compiled (with a special font
compiler) for every different architecture.  In R5, fonts are distributed in
portable compiled format which can be used directly on any architecture.
To find out more about the various font file formats, see The X
Resource, Issue 2.ID="S2-1002-A-1"Font Naming ConventionsID="IX-1002-A-10"fontsnaming conventionID="IX-1002-A-11"conventionsfont namingFont names are not determined by the names of the files in which they
are stored.  Instead a font's name is determined by the contents of
the font property named FONT*.  A font can be referred to by
this name or by any of the aliases specified in an alias file in
the directory containing the font file.The syntax of font names is defined in the X Logical Font Description
convention, or XLFD.  The complete XLFD is reprinted in Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual.  This
appendix tells you the essential information, however.If you run xlsfonts, you will get an intimidating list of names
similar to the one shown in Figure A-1 which, upon closer
examination, contains a great deal of useful information:ID="FG-1002-A-1"A fully specified font nameFORMAT="GIF" FILEREF="App.A.1.gif" ID="GC-1002-A-2"This rather verbose line is actually the name of the font stored in the
file courBO10 (in the 75dpi directory).  This font name
specifies the foundry (Adobe), font family (Courier), weight (bold)
slant (Oblique), set width (normal), size of the font in pixels (10),
size of the font in tenths of a point (100, measured in tenths of a
point, thus equals 10 points), horizontal resolution (75 dpi), vertical
resolution (75 dpi), spacing (m, for monospace), average width in tenths
of a pixel (60, measured in tenths of a pixel, thus equals 6 pixels)
and character set (iso8859-1).The meaning of many of these statistics is obvious.  Some of the less
obvious information is explained below:foundryThe type foundry (in this case, Adobe) that digitized and supplied the font.set widthA value describing a font's proportionate width, according to the foundry.
Typical set widths include:  normal, condensed, narrow, double width.  All
of the non-misc fonts have the set width normal.pixels and pointsType is normally measured in points, a printer's unit equal to 1/72 of
an inch.  The size of a font in pixels depends on the resolution of the
display font in pixels.  For example, if the display font has 100-dpi
resolution, a 12-point font will have a pixel size of 17, while with
75-dpi resolution, a 12-point font will have a pixel size of 12.
If both these fields and average width are all zero, the X server or
a font server may supply a scalable font, as described in LINKEND="S1-1002-A-3"Section A.3, "Scalable Fonts."spacingEither m (monospace, i.e., fixed-width) or p (proportional, i.e.,
variable-width).horizontal and vertical resolutionThe resolution in dots per inch for which a font is designed.  Horizontal
and vertical figures are required because a screen may have different
capacities for horizontal and vertical resolution.average widthMean width of all characters in the font, measured in tenths of a
pixel; in this case, 6 pixels.
If this field and pixels and points are all zero, the X server or
a font server may supply a scalable font, as described in LINKEND="S1-1002-A-3"Section A.3, "Scalable Fonts."character setISO, the International Standards Organization, has defined character
set standards for various languages.  The iso8859-1 in Figure A-1
represents the ISO Latin-1 character set, which is used by all of the
fonts in the 75dpi and 100dpi directories.  The
ISO Latin-1 character set is a superset of the standard ASCII character
set, which includes various special characters used in European
languages other than English.  See Appendix H, Keysym Reference, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual,
for a complete listing and example glyphs of the characters in the
ISO Latin-1 character set.This font naming convention is intended to allow for the unique naming
of fonts of any style, resolution, and size.  It is powerful but unwieldy.To display text using the font stored in the file courBO10,
you could use the resource setting:ID="SC-1002-A-1".yourapp*font:  -adobe-courier-bold-o-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1Since typing a font name of this length is neither desirable nor practical,
the X Window System developers have provided two alternatives:  wildcarding
and aliasing.ID="S2-1002-A-2"Font Name WildcardingID="IX-1002-A-12"fontswildcardingID="IX-1002-A-13"wildcardsin font namesAny unnecessary part of a font name can be "wildcarded" by specifying ?
for any single character and * for any group of characters.For example, using a wildcarded font name, the resource specification
above could be written:ID="SC-1002-A-2"*label:  *courier-bold-o-*-100*(Note that when using wildcards with the -fn command line option,
you must take care to quote the font names, since the UNIX shell
has special meanings for the wildcard characters * and ?.  This can be
done by enclosing the entire font name in quotes or by escaping each
wildcard character by typing a backslash before it.)If more than one font in a given directory matches a wildcarded font
name, the server chooses the font to use.  If fonts from more than
one directory match the wildcarded name, the server will always choose
a font from the directory that is earlier in the font path.  Thus, if
a wildcarded font name matches a font from both the 75dpi and
the 100dpi directories and the 75dpi directory comes first
in the font path, the server chooses the font from that directory.In creating a wildcarded font name, you need to decide which parts of the
standard font name must be explicit and which parts can be replaced with
wildcards.  As the previous example illustrates, you can use a single
wildcard character for multiple parts of the font name.  For instance,
the final asterisk in the example stands for the sequence:ID="SC-1002-A-3"-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1in the explicit font name.  The idea is to specify enough parts of the
font name explicitly so that the server gives you the font you have in mind.It is helpful to familiarize yourself with the available font families,
weights, slants, and point sizes.  The following list gives these statistics
for the fonts in the directories 75dpi and 100dpi in the
standard X distribution from MIT.  LINKEND="FN-1002-A-1"ID="FN-1002-A-1"For fonts other than those shipped by MIT, other families, weights,
slants, point sizes, etc. may apply.
(The fonts in the misc directory are holdovers from Release 2
and have short, manageable names that should not require wildcarding.)

try displaying one of the fonts with xfd, as described in Volume Three, X Window System User's Guide.As a general rule, we suggest you type the following parts of
a font name explicitly:MARK="BULLET"Font familyWeightSlantPoint sizeNote that it is better to match the point size field, which is measured
in tenths of a point (the 100 in the previous example, equal to 10 points),
than the pixel field (the 10).  This allows your wildcarded font name to
work properly with monitors of different resolutions.  For example, say
you use the following name to specify a 24-point (size), medium (weight),
Italic (slant), Charter (family) font:ID="SC-1002-A-4"*charter-medium-i-*-240-*This will match either of the following two font names (the first for
75-dpi monitors and the second for 100-dpi monitors):ID="SC-1002-A-5"-bitstream-charter-medium-i-normal--25-240-75-75-p-136-iso8859-1
-bitstream-charter-medium-i-normal--33-240-100-100-p-136-iso8859-1depending on which directory comes first in your font path.  Specifying
font size explicitly in pixels (25 for the first or 33 for the second)
rather than in points would limit you to matching only one of these fonts.Given the complexity of font names and the rules of precedence used by
the server, you should use wildcards carefully.ID="S2-1002-A-3"Font Name AliasingID="IX-1002-A-16" SPAN="START"aliasing font namesID="IX-1002-A-17" SPAN="START"fontsaliasingAnother way to abbreviate font names is by aliasing--that is, by
associating them with alternative names.  You can create a file (or
files) called fonts.alias in any directory in the font search
path to set aliases for the fonts in that directory.  The X server uses
both fonts.dir files (see Section A.2.5) and fonts.aliasID="IX-1002-A-18"fonts.dir fileID="IX-1002-A-19"fonts.alias fileID="IX-1002-A-20"filesfonts.aliasID="IX-1002-A-21"filesfonts.dir
files to locate fonts in the font path.Be aware that when you create or edit a fonts.alias file, the server
does not automatically recognize the aliases in question.  You must
make the server aware of newly created or edited alias files by resetting
the font path with xset as described in Section A.2.4.The fonts.alias file has a two-column format similar to the
fonts.dir file:  the first column contains aliases, the second
contains the actual font names.  If you want to specify an alias that
contains spaces, enclose the alias in double quotes.  If you want to
include double quotes or other special characters as part of an alias,
precede each special symbol with a backslash.When you use an alias to specify a font in a command line, the server
searches for the font associated with that alias in every directory in
the font path.  Therefore, a fonts.alias file in one directory
can set aliases for fonts in other directories as well.  You might choose
to create a single aliases file in one directory of the font path to set
aliases for the most commonly used fonts in all the directories.
Example A-1 shows a sample fonts.alias file.ID="EX-1002-A-1"Sample fonts.alias filexterm12   -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1

xterm18   -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--18-180-75-75-m-110-iso8859-1As the names of the aliases suggest, this sample file contains aliases
for three fonts (of different point sizes) that are easily readable in
xterm windows.You can also use wildcards within the font names in the right-hand column
of an alias file.  For instance, the alias file above might also be written:ID="SC-1002-A-6"xterm12   *courier-medium-r-*-120*
xterm14   *courier-medium-r-*-140*
xterm18   *courier-medium-r-*-180*Once the server is made aware of aliases, you can specify an alias in
resource specifications or on the command line:ID="SC-1002-A-7"xterm.font: xterm12or:ID="SC-1002-A-8"xterm -fn xterm12If you want each
font name to be equivalent to the name of the file in which it is
stored, without the .snf extension, you can use alias files.
In each directory in the font path, create a fonts.alias file
containing only the following line:
ID="IX-1002-A-22"fontsusing file name as aliasID="SC-1002-A-9"FILE_NAMES_ALIASESEach filename (without the .snf extension) will then serve as an
alias for the font the file contains.  Note that an alias file containing
this line applies only to the directory in which it is found.  To make
every font name equivalent to the name of the file in which it is stored,
you need to create a fonts.alias file such as this in every font
directory.If you have specified FILE_NAMES_ALIASES in an alias file, you
can choose the fonts in that directory by means of their filenames, as

the font(s) it needs.Each fonts.dir file contains a list of all the font files in the

from several vendors,
you may have encountered frustrating problems with
the use of fonts.  If fonts have different names on one
host than they do on another,
an application that performs normally on one display
will abort with a "Can't load font" error on another.
Or you may have had to maintain separate defaults files
for use on different displays.ID="IX-1002-A-33"networked font servicefont serviceIdeally, the site administrator could simply place
fonts in a directory of a networked file system that is accessible to
all hosts at the site.  Unfortunately, no
binary format for font data has been standardized, and
the X servers supplied by different vendors
expect data in mutually incompatible formats.  If a
vendor wishes to support several font formats, the
server must include code to parse each one.R5 provides an elegant solution to these problems in
the form of a networked font service.  Under this
new model, an X server can obtain font data in a simple
bitmap format from a font server process running
somewhere on the network.  The font server does the
work of parsing font files for any supported format and
exports font data in a bitmap format standardized by
the X Font Service Protocol (reprinted in Volume Zero, X Protocol Reference Manual as of late 1992).  X
servers
ID="IX-1002-A-34"font serviceprotocolID="IX-1002-A-35"X Font Service Protocol
that take advantage of font service no longer need to
do the work of parsing fonts themselves.  In the near
future, however, it is likely that workstation-based X servers
and X terminals will continue to
support file-based fonts along with their support for
font servers.The Font Service Protocol was designed by Jim Fulton of
Network Computing Devices.  The font server in the MIT
distribution was implemented primarily by Dave Lemke,
ID="IX-1002-A-36"Apple Computerfont servers
also of NCD.  In addition, Apple Computer has donated a
font server (which runs only on the Apple Macintosh
computer) to export the Apple bitmap fonts, and, if
available, the Apple TrueType fonts as well.Typically, a font server will run on one host per site
ID="IX-1002-A-37"font serviceconfigurationID="IX-1002-A-38"font servicearchitecture
and will export all the fonts available at the site,
but there are a variety of other ways that font service can
be configured.  A large site may choose to have
multiple font servers to prevent overloading of a single server
or to protect against service outages
caused by network trouble or server crashes.
A font server could export fonts parsed
from a variety of formats, or a separate server could
be used for each format.  A vendor of fonts with a
custom format might provide a special font server to
export those fonts, and might use the special server to
implement licensing policies--restricting the maximum
ID="IX-1002-A-39"font serviceused for licensing
number of simultaneous users of a font, for example.
Finally, note that in the terminology of X font
service, the X server is a font client, and that

it is perfectly legal to have other font clients such
as printer drivers.

tcp/ora-server:7000/100dpi+misc, tcp/ora-server:7001/new-fontsNaming a font server is conceptually the same as naming
an X display, but obviously the naming schemes used are
very different.  When naming an X server, a TCP/IP
connection is distinguished from a DECnet connection
solely by the number of colons that separate the
hostname from the display number, and this scheme is
not elegantly extensible to other network
technologies in the future.  Furthermore, an X server
communicates over a port which is a relative offset
(the display number) from a "hardcoded" base port
number, but base port numbers cannot simply be
ID="IX-1002-A-63"port numbers
allocated; they must be assigned by the powers that be
in the network world.  Font server names specify an
absolute port number, rather than a relative number.
The default is 7000 as in
LINKEND="EX-1002-A-3"Example A-3,
but this can
easily be overridden (it is a command-line option) if
it conflicts with other
services or even other font servers.  If X were
rewritten today, display names would probably be just
like font server names:  they would explicitly specify
the network type and absolute port number.ID="S2-1002-A-7"Font Server ConfigurationID="IX-1002-A-64"font serversconfigurationID="IX-1002-A-65"fsID="IX-1002-A-66"font serversstartupThe font server shipped as part of the MIT R5
distribution is named fs.  Generally it is
started up automatically on reboot of whatever server
machine it is running on.  For standalone machines, it
may be appropriate to have xdm start up the
font server when a user logs in.  On startup,
fs reads a configuration file named on the
command line, or the default file /usr/lib/X11/fs/config.
This configuration file lists the directories
of fonts that the server should export, and controls
such things as the maximum number of clients allowed to
connect to the server, and the default point size the server
should return when a font name does not specify a size.
The format of this file is
documented in the fs man page in the reference
section of this book, and the default
config file is a good example.  Note that this
configuration file is not installed by default when
R5 is built.  Unless you plan to always use the
command-line configuration option to fs, you
should install the configuration file by hand, or add
this line at the end of mit/config/site.def to
have it installed automatically by the build process:ID="SC-1002-A-13"#define InstallFSConfig YESThe forthcoming O'Reilly & Associates book on X
administration will cover font server configuration in
more detail.ID="IX-1002-A-67"Apple Computerfont serversThe R5 distribution from MIT also includes a font
server for the Apple Macintosh which will export Apple
bitmap fonts (and Apple TrueType fonts if they are
available) to X servers on the network.  The source
code for this server is in
mit/fonts/server/MacFS and will only build on
a Macintosh running A/UX.  The README file in this
directory provides minimal documentation on building
and configuring the server.  Note that the
fonts themselves are not part of the R5
distribution; these must exist on the Macintosh
that will be exporting them.ID="S1-1002-A-3"Scalable FontsID="IX-1002-A-68" SPAN="START"scalable fontsAnother new feature in R5 is font scaling.  In
ID="IX-1002-A-69"font servicescalingID="IX-1002-A-70"font scalingID="IX-1002-A-71"fontsscalable
previous releases, each font was available only in a
limited number of standard point sizes and resolutions.
In the MIT distribution of R5, both the X server and
the font server implement a simple bitmap font-scaling
algorithm that allows fonts to be obtained at any
desired point size and resolution.  Bitmap fonts are
easily scalable, but the resulting scaled font is
generally jagged and difficult to read.  Fortunately,
R5 also provides a set of outline fonts.  Outline
fonts scale nicely, but the scaling process requires
significant computation, so an X server
might freeze for several seconds while scaling a large Asian font.
This is one of the
problems that font servers are intended to address.
The fonts and the scaling code
were donated by Bitstream, Inc.Until Release 5, X relied exclusively on non-scalable
bitmap fonts.  If there was no installed font in the
ID="IX-1002-A-72"bitmapfontsID="IX-1002-A-73"fontsbitmap
point size and resolution you wanted, then you were out
of luck--it is obviously not feasible to provide every
font in every point size and for every possible
resolution.  Bitmap fonts do not scale well, because
their pixel-by-pixel specification can only be made
smaller by omitting pixels or made larger by making
pixels bigger, resulting in a jagged, low-resolution
font.  The fonts shipped by MIT for Release 5 include
several "outline fonts" which describe characters by
their component curves rather than by individual
pixels.  This description allows for successful scaling
to any desired point size and resolution.  The font
ID="IX-1002-A-74"scaling~fonts
server shipped by MIT in Release 5 has the capability
to read and scale these outline fonts, and therefore
the number of fonts available to the user is greatly
increased.  (Note, however, that a good bitmap font that is
ID="IX-1002-A-75"hand-tuned~fonts
"hand-tuned" to a particular point size and screen
resolution will generally be better looking than an
outline font scaled to that size and resolution.  Font
design is an art, and the human touch is still
important.)The
following two sections apply equally
to all scalable and scaled fonts, whether outline or
bitmap, from the X server or the font server.ID="S2-1002-A-8"Finding Scalable FontsID="IX-1002-A-76"scalable fontsfindingSupporting scalable fonts raises some important
questions about the behavior of the Xlib function
XListFonts().  First, since there are
ID="IX-1002-A-77"XListFontsand scalable fonts
(theoretically) an infinite number of point sizes and
resolutions that a font could be scaled to, it is no
longer possible to list all available fonts in
all available sizes.  So some special syntax is
needed to indicate that a font is scalable and is
available in any desired size, even if that size is
not listed.  But backwards compatibility is also an
issue--the new point sizes provided by scalable fonts
should not be hidden from existing pre-R5
applications.These seemingly contradictory goals are resolved by
changing the semantics of the call to XListFonts()ID="IX-1002-A-78"XListFontsnew semantics
and by extending the X Logical Font Description
Conventions slightly.  LINKEND="FN-1002-A-2"ID="IX-1002-A-79"XLFDID="IX-1002-A-80"X Logical Font Description (XLFD)ID="FN-1002-A-2"The XLFD Conventions are printed as Appendix M of X

PIXEL_SIZE, POINT_SIZE, and AVERAGE_WIDTH fields (the

three fields zero, and therefore these fields are sufficient
to distinguish scalable from non-scalable fonts.

A well-formed font name is one that
contains all 14 hyphens specified in the XLFD
convention.  Wildcards are permitted for any field, but
may not replace multiple fields--all fields must be
present in the name.  For example,ID="SC-1002-A-14"   *-helvetica-bold-o-*-*-*-120-*is not a well-formed name, butID="SC-1002-A-15"   -*-helvetica-bold-o-*-*-*-120-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1ID="IX-1002-A-90"font nameswell-formedis well-formed.  Shortcut names specified as in the first example
have come into common use, but with the increasing
variety of display resolutions and fonts with
non-standard charsets, it is good practice to specify
these extra fields, even if you are not interested in
using scaled fonts.  If XListFonts() is passed a
pattern that is not well-formed, it may not include
scalable fonts in the search at all.To list scalable fonts, call XListFonts() with
a well-formed pattern with "0" or "*" in its
PIXEL_SIZE, POINT_SIZE, and AVERAGE_WIDTH fields.

itself.  If you call XLoadFont() on this font
name without a size, you will get some implementation-defined default size.  Instead of listing scalable
Helvetica fonts, for example, you will more often want
to list all Helvetica fonts at some particular point
size.  The list you get may contain non-scaled bitmap

In order to include derived instances of scalable fonts
in a search, it is necessary to specify some of the

AVERAGE_WIDTH (fields 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.)  In order
for XListFonts() to list a particular scaled size

enough of these scalable fields must be specified so that the
font name pattern matches exactly one
derived instance of the font.

If too few of the scalable fields are specified, there
will be no unique match, and if too many are specified,
there may not be any possible scaling that meets all of
those specified criteria.When searching for fonts at a particular size, you will
typically wildcard the pixel size and average width by
setting those fields to "*" and explicitly specify the
point size you want along with the x- and y-resolutions
of your screen.  (You can calculate screen resolutions
with macros like DisplayWidth() and
DisplayWidthMM(), as shown in a later example.)
These three fields specify all that is needed to
correctly scale the font.  You need not (and should
not) specify the pixel size, because the point size and
y-resolution of the screen determine the desired
pixel size.  You need not specify the average width
because the point size and x-resolution of the
screen, together with the height to width ratio
implicit to the font, determine the desired width.  It
is also possible to name a single derived instance of a
scalable font by specifying a pixel size plus x- and y-resolutions.  There are also other combinations of
fields that will work, but none are particularly useful
in practice.

                  50, &count);There are a number of reasons that a font name pattern
could fail to match derived instances of scalable
fonts.  It is difficult to devise an algorithm that will
correctly match scalable fonts against any font name
pattern.  For this reason, the X server or font server
is not required to include scalable fonts in its search
if the pattern it is given is not well-formed.  A
well-formed pattern must contain 14 hyphens.  Note in
particular that the first character in a well-formed
name must be a hyphen.An underspecified font name
ID="IX-1002-A-108"scalable fontsunderspecified namesID="IX-1002-A-109"font namesunderspecifiedID="IX-1002-A-110"underspecified font names
will not match any derived instances of
scalable fonts.  This is because your
font name could match any number of derived instances,
and it is not possible to list them all.
When only the point size and pixel size are specified, for
example, they are enough together to determine the
desired y-resolution for the font, but any x-resolution
(and therefore any average width)
is still possible.  To uniquely match a derived instance, you'd
have to specify the x-resolution of your screen or a
desired average width for the font.
The MIT implementation, however, makes reasonable
guesses for unspecified resolution values, so
underspecified font names do not occur.  If only point
size is specified, then default resolutions (75 or
100 dpi) are used.  If both point and pixel size are
specified as above, then the y-resolution they specify
is used for both x- and y-resolution fields.Similarly, an

advantage of scalable fonts, must provide
a well-formed and correctly specified font name.  Other

easily ported to X11, albeit with a loss of performance.  In addition,
there are a few X10 routines that provide functionality missing in
X11, which may still be used.  This appendix discusses XDraw ()and
related commands and association table routines for data management.These functions are provided for compatibility with X Version 10.
They are considered a part of Xlib even though they exist in a
separate library.  They can be used by including the file
<X11/X10.h> and linking with the -loldX library.X Version 11 XDraw now provides all the functionality of
the X Version 10 routines XDraw, XDrawDashed, and
XDrawPatterned. X Version 11 XDrawFilled() now provides
the functionality of the old XDrawFilled() and XDrawTiled.
These routines now use the GC to specify the fill, tile or stipple,
line styles, etc.ID="IX-1002-B-1"association tablesID="IX-1002-B-2"tablesassociation
The association table routines are described next in this appendix.
They are also carried over from X10, although their functionality
is also provided by the context manager routines described
in LINKEND="CH-1002-15-1"Chapter 15, "Other Programming Techniques."  However, there are no performance
penalties for using association tables if you prefer them.See Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, for complete information on using any X10 compatibility function.ID="S1-1002-B-1"XDraw and XDrawFilled()XDraw and XDrawFilled() call other Xlib routines,
ID="IX-1002-B-3"XDrawID="IX-1002-B-4"XDrawFilled
not the server directly.  If you just have straight lines to draw,
using XDrawLines() or XDrawSegments() is much faster.
ID="IX-1002-B-5"XDrawLinesID="IX-1002-B-6"XDrawSegments
If you want to draw spline curves in a portable fashion, you
currently have no choice but to use XDraw until a standard
spline extension is adopted.XDraw draws an arbitrary polygon or curve.  The figure drawn
ID="IX-1002-B-7"XDraw
is defined by a list of vertices (vlist).  The points are
connected by lines as specified in the flags in the vertex structure.
ID="IX-1002-B-8"Version 10 functions
In X Version 11, XDraw provides all the functionality of
the X Version 10 routines XDraw, XDrawDashed, and
ID="IX-1002-B-9"XDrawID="IX-1002-B-10"XDrawDashedXDrawPatterned.  XDrawFilled() now
ID="IX-1002-B-11"XDrawPatternedID="IX-1002-B-12"XDrawFilled
provides the functionality of the old XDrawFilled() and
XDrawTiled.  The fill, pattern, line_style, and
ID="IX-1002-B-13"XDrawTiled
tile are all controlled by the graphics context.  Lines are properly
joined according to the GC if they connect and make a closed figure.The error status returned is the opposite of what it was under
X Version 10, conforming to the X Version 11 standard that 0 indicates
failure.  The VertexDrawLastPoint flag and the routines
XAppendVertex and XClearVertexFlag from X Version 10
are not supported.The vlist and vcount arguments of XDraw and

   short x,y;
   unsigned short flags;

a Vertex list which has a vertex with VertexStartClosed
set not followed by a vertex with VertexEndClosed set.  The
x and y coordinates in Vertex are relative to
the upper-left inside corner of the drawable if VertexRelative
is not specified in flags or to the previous vertex if
VertexRelative is specified.  The first vertex must be
an absolute vertex.If VertexDontDraw is specified in flags, no line or curve
is drawn from the previous vertex to this one.  This is analogous to picking
up the pen and moving it to another place before drawing another line.If VertexCurved is specified in flags, a spline algorithm
is used to draw a smooth curve from the previous vertex through the current
one to the next vertex.  Otherwise, a straight line is drawn from the
previous vertex to the current one.  You should set VertexCurved
in flags only if a previous and next vertex are both defined,
either explicitly or through the definition of a closed curve.  If
VertexStartClosed is specified, then this point marks the
beginning of a closed curve.  This vertex must be followed later in the
array by another vertex whose absolute coordinates are identical and
which has VertexEndClosed specified in its flags.It is permissible for both the VertexDontDraw and the
VertexCurved bits to be 1.  This is useful to define the previous
point for the smooth curve, without drawing until the current point.Example B-2 shows a routine that draws a box on the root window
for use by the window manager described in LINKEND="CH-1002-16-1"Chapter 16, "Window Management."  Of
course, you would want to create the GC in the calling routine if

be searched frequently.  They are implemented as a linked list of
structures.  To use these functions, you must link in -loldX,
the X10 compatibility library.Association tables associate arbitrary information with resource IDs.
This is similar to the context manager, but the resource IDs used
with association tables are existing resources, not created for the
purpose of storing data for later retrieval.ID="IX-1002-B-17"XAssocTableAn XAssocTable can be used to type X resources.  For example,
the user may wish to have three or four "types" of windows, each with
different properties.  This can be accomplished by associating each
X window ID with a pointer to a window property data structure defined
by the programmer.  The generic type for resource IDs is XID.
ID="IX-1002-B-18"XIDID="IX-1002-B-19"XAssocTableID="IX-1002-B-20"hash tables
There are a few guidelines that should be observed when using an
XAssocTable:MARK="BULLET"ID="IX-1002-B-21"XIDAll XIDs are relative to the currently active display.
Therefore, if you are using multiple displays, you need to be sure the
correct display is active before performing an XAssocTable
operation.  XAssocTable imposes no restrictions on the number
of XIDs per table, the number of XIDs per display, or
the number of displays per table.Because of the hashing scheme used by the association mechanism, the
following rules for determining the size of XAssocTables
should be followed.  Associations will be made and looked up more
efficiently if the table size (number of buckets in the hashing
system) is a power of two and if there are not more than eight
XIDs per bucket.XCreateAssocTable() creates an association table.  To create an
ID="IX-1002-B-22"XCreateAssocTable
entry in a specific XAssocTable, use XMakeAssoc().  Some
ID="IX-1002-B-23"XMakeAssoc
size suggestions might be:  use 32 buckets per 100 objects; a reasonable
maximum number of objects per buckets is 8.  XMakeAssoc() inserts
data into an XAssocTable keyed on an XID.
XDeleteAssoc() deletes an association in an XAssocTable
keyed on its XID.  Data is inserted into the table only once.
ID="IX-1002-B-24"XDeleteAssocID="IX-1002-B-25"XID
Redundant inserts are meaningless and cause no problems.  The queue in
each association bucket is sorted from the lowest XID to the
highest XID.  Redundant deletes (and deletes of nonexistent
XIDs) are meaningless and cause no problems.  Deleting
associations in no way impairs the performance of an XAssocTable.XLookUpAssoc() retrieves the data stored in an XAssocTableID="IX-1002-B-26"XLookUpAssoc
by its XID.  If an appropriately matching XID can be found
in the table, the routine will return the data associated with it.  If the
XID cannot be found in the table, the routine will return NULL.XDestroyAssocTable() frees the memory associated with a specific
ID="IX-1002-B-27"XDestroyAssocTableXAssocTable.  Using an XAssocTable after it has been
destroyed is guaranteed to have unpredictable and probably disastrous
consequences!

and the protocol so that extensions will have the same performance as
the core routines.  This appendix provides reference information on
how to write extensions and integrate them into Xlib.  This appendix
is not a tutorial, and you will need to look at existing extensions to
figure out how to write one yourself.ID="FN-1002-C-1"This appendix is lightly edited and reformatted from the original
MIT material.  Before attempting to write extensions, you should be
intimately familiar with the X Window System Protocol, Version 11,
by Robert Scheifler and Ron Newman, and with the server code.Unfortunately, this appendix does not currently provide sufficient
tutorial or contextual information to allow you to build an extension.
We intend to provide a more helpful description of how to write
extensions in a forthcoming book about the server.  In the meantime,
several sample extensions are provided with the X core distribution
which can be used as examples.Extensions can be added to Xlib only with no protocol addition or
to both Xlib and the server with a protocol addition.  Several
extensions are already available that support nonrectangular
windows, 3-D graphics, and alternate input devices and multibuffering.
See the code for these for examples of writing extensions.Because X can only evolve by extension to the core protocol, it is
important that extensions not be perceivable as second-class citizens.
At some point, some extensions may be adopted as parts of the "X Standard."Therefore, there should be little to distinguish the use of an extension
from that of the core protocol.  To avoid having to initialize extensions
explicitly in application programs, extensions should perform "lazy
evaluations" and automatically initialize themselves when called for
the first time.Extensions written according to these instructions will run at essentially
the same performance as the core protocol requests.It is expected that a given extension to X will consist of multiple
requests.  Defining ten new features as ten separate extensions is a
bad practice.  Rather, they should be packaged into a single extension
and should use minor opcodes to distinguish the requests.The symbols and macros used for writing stubs to Xlib are listed in

They are not normally used by application programmers but are used
by people who need to extend the core X protocol and
the X library interface.
The functions, which generate protocol requests for X, are typically
called stubs.In extensions, stubs first should check to see if they have initialized
themselves on a connection.
If they have not, they then should call
ID="IX-1002-C-14"XInitExtensionXInitExtension()
to attempt to initialize themselves on the connection.If the extension needs to be informed of GC/font allocation or

An
ID="IX-1002-C-41"XEventXEvent
structure always has a type code (type int) as the first component.  This
uniquely identifies what kind of event it is.  The second component is
always the serial number (type unsignedlong) of the last request processed
by the server.  The third component is always a boolean (type BoolP) indicating
whether the event came from a
ID="IX-1002-C-42"SendEventSendEvent
protocol request.  The fourth component is always a pointer to the display
the event was read from.  The fifth component is always a resource ID of
one kind or another, usually a window, carefully selected to be useful to
toolkit dispatchers.  The fifth component should always exist, even if
the event does not have a natural "destination" if there is no value
from the protocol to put in this component, initialize it to zero.There is an implementation limit such that your host event
structure size cannot be bigger than the size of the
ID="IX-1002-C-43"XEventXEvent
union of structures.
There also is no way to guarantee that more than 24 elements or 96 characters
in the structure will be fully portable between machines.ID="S3-1002-C-7"XESetWireToEventID="IX-1002-C-44"XESetWireToEventID="SC-1002-C-19"int (*XESetWireToEvent()(display, event_number, proc))()

needs to be converted from wire format
ID="IX-1002-C-45"xEvent
(xEvent)
to host format
ID="IX-1002-C-46"XEvent
(XEvent).
The event number defines which protocol event number to install a
conversion routine for.
This procedure returns any previously defined procedure.You can replace a core event conversion routine with one
of your own, although this is not encouraged.
It would, however, allow you to intercept a core event
and modify it before being placed in the queue or otherwise examined.When Xlib needs to convert an event from wire format to host
format, your routine is called with these arguments:ID="SC-1002-C-20"Status (*proc)(display, re, event)
    Display *display;
    XEvent *re;
    xEvent *event;Your routine must return status to indicate if the conversion succeeded.
The re argument is a pointer to where the host format event should be stored,
and the event argument is the 32-byte wire event structure.
In the
ID="IX-1002-C-47"XEventXEvent
structure you are creating,
you must fill in the five required members of the event structure.
You should fill in the type member with the type specified for the
ID="IX-1002-C-48"xEventxEvent
structure.
You should copy all other members from the
ID="IX-1002-C-49"xEventxEvent
structure (wire format) to the
ID="IX-1002-C-50"XEventXEvent
structure (host format).
Your conversion routine should return
ID="IX-1002-C-51"TrueTrue

The event number defines which protocol event number to install a
conversion routine for.
This procedure returns any previously defined procedure.
It returns zero if the conversion fails or nonzero otherwise.You can replace a core event conversion routine with one
of your own, although this is not encouraged.
It would, however, allow you to intercept a core event
and modify it before being sent to another client.When Xlib needs to convert an event from host format to wire format,
your routine is called with these arguments:ID="SC-1002-C-23"(*proc)(display, re, event)
    Display *display;
    XEvent *re;
    xEvent *event;The re argument is a pointer to the host format event,
and the event argument is a pointer to where the 32-byte wire event
structure should be stored.
You should fill in the type with the type from the
ID="IX-1002-C-57"XEventXEvent structure.
All other members then should be copied from the host format to the

      Bool (*proc)();displaySpecifies the connection to the X server.error_numberSpecifies the error code.procSpecifies the routine to call when an error is received.This function defines a procedure to be called when an extension
error needs to be converted from wire format to host format.
The error number defines which protocol error code to install
the conversion routine for.
This procedure returns any previously defined procedure.Use this function for extension errors that contain additional error values
beyond those in a core X error, when multiple wire errors must be combined
into a single Xlib error, or when it is necessary to intercept an
X error before it is otherwise examined.When Xlib needs to convert an error from wire format to host format, the
routine is called with these arguments:ID="SC-1002-C-25"Bool (*proc)(display, he, we)
    Display *display;
    XErrorEvent *he;
    xError *we;The he argument is a pointer to where the host format error should be stored.
The structure pointed at by he is guaranteed to be as large as an
ID="IX-1002-C-60"XEventXEvent
structure, and so can be cast to a type larger than an
ID="IX-1002-C-61"XErrorEventXErrorEvent(),
in order to store additional values.
If the error is to be completely ignored by Xlib
(for example, several protocol error structures will be combined into
one Xlib error),
then the function should return
ID="IX-1002-C-62"FalseFalse;
otherwise it should return
ID="IX-1002-C-63"TrueTrue.ID="S3-1002-C-11"XESetErrorID="IX-1002-C-64"XESetErrorID="SC-1002-C-26"int (*XESetError()(display, extension, proc))()

calling of the external error handling when an error occurs.
This allows status to be returned on a call at the cost of the call
being synchronous (though most such routines are query operations, in any
case, and are typically programmed to be synchronous).When Xlib detects a protocol error in
ID="IX-1002-C-65"_XReply_XReply(),
it calls your procedure with these arguments:ID="SC-1002-C-27"int (*proc)(display, err, codes, ret_code)

    XExtCodes *codes;
    int *ret_code;The err argument is a pointer to the 32-byte wire format error.
The codes argument is a pointer to the extension codes structure.
The ret_code argument is the return code you may want
_XReply
returned to.If your routine returns a zero value,
the error is not suppressed, and
the client's error handler is called.
(For further information, see Section 11.8.2.)
If your routine returns nonzero,
the error is suppressed, and
ID="IX-1002-C-66"_XReply_XReply
returns the value of ret_code.ID="S3-1002-C-12"XESetErrorStringID="IX-1002-C-67"XESetErrorStringID="SC-1002-C-28"char  *(*XESetErrorString()(display, extension, proc))()

is called when a GC cache needs to be updated in the server.ID="S2-1002-C-7"Hooks onto Xlib Data StructuresVarious Xlib data structures have provisions for extension routines
to chain extension supplied data onto a list.
These structures are
ID="IX-1002-C-78"graphics contextID="IX-1002-C-79"GCgraphics contextGC,
ID="IX-1002-C-80"VisualVisual,
ID="IX-1002-C-81"ScreenScreen,

ID="IX-1002-C-83"Display structureDisplay,
and
ID="IX-1002-C-84"XFontStructXFontStruct.
Because the list pointer is always the first member in the structure,
a single set of routines can be used to manipulate the data
on these lists.The following structure is used in the routines in this section
and is defined in
ID="IX-1002-C-85"Xlib.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-86"include filesXlib.h
<Xlib.h>:
ID="IX-1002-C-87"XExtDataID="SC-1002-C-33"typedef struct _XExtData {

    int (*free_private)();   /* if defined,  called to free private */
    XPointer private_data;   /* data private to this extension. */
} XExtData;When any of the data structures listed above are freed,
the list is walked, and the structure's free routine (if any) is called.
If free is NULL,
then the library frees both the data pointed to by the private_data member
and the structure itself.ID="SC-1002-C-34"union {    Display *display;

It is expected that an extension will add at most one extension
data structure to any single data structure's extension data list.
There is no way to find additional structures.ID="S3-1002-C-18"XAllocIDThe
ID="IX-1002-C-96"XAllocIDXAllocID()
macro, which allocates and returns a resource ID, is defined in

ID="IX-1002-C-100"Display structureDisplay
structure to the internal resource ID allocator.
It returns a resource ID that you can use when creating new resources.ID="S1-1002-C-3"GC CachingGCs are cached by the library to allow merging of independent change
requests to the same GC into single protocol requests.
This is typically called a write-back cache.
Any extension routine whose behavior depends on the contents of a GC must flush
the GC cache to make sure the server has up-to-date contents in its GC.The
ID="IX-1002-C-101"FlushGCFlushGC()
macro checks the dirty bits in the library's GC structure and calls
ID="IX-1002-C-102"_XFlushGC_XFlushGCCache
if any elements have changed.
The
FlushGC()
macro is defined as follows:ID="SC-1002-C-39"FlushGC(display, gc)
      Display *display;
      GC gc;displaySpecifies the connection to the X server.gcSpecifies the GC.Note that if you extend the GC to add additional resource ID components,
you should ensure that the library stub sends the change request immediately.
This is because a client can free a resource immediately after
using it, so if you only stored the value in the cache without
forcing a protocol request, the resource might be destroyed before being
set into the GC.
You can use the
ID="IX-1002-C-103"_XFlushGC_XFlushGCCache
procedure
to force the cache to be flushed.
The
_XFlushGCCache procedure is defined as follows:
ID="IX-1002-C-104"_XFlushGCCacheID="SC-1002-C-40"_XFlushGC()Cache(display, gc)
      Display *display;
      GC gc;displaySpecifies the connection to the X server.gcSpecifies the GC.ID="S1-1002-C-4"Graphics BatchingIf you extend X to add more poly graphics primitives, you may be able to
take advantage of facilities in the library to allow back-to-back
single calls to be transformed into poly requests.
This may dramatically improve performance of programs that are not
written using poly requests.
A pointer to an
ID="IX-1002-C-105"xReqxReq(),
called last_req in the display structure, is the last request being processed.
By checking that the last request
type, drawable, gc, and other options are the same as the new one
and that there is enough space left in the buffer, you may be able
to just extend the previous graphics request by extending the length
field of the request and appending the data to the buffer.
This can improve performance by five times or more in naive programs.
For example, here is the source for the
ID="IX-1002-C-106"XDrawPointXDrawPoint()
stub.
(Writing extension stubs is discussed in the next section.)ID="SC-1002-C-41"#include "copyright.h"

}To keep clients from generating very long requests that may monopolize the
server,
there is a symbol defined in
ID="IX-1002-C-107"Xlibint.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-108"include filesXlibint.h
<Xlibint.h>of EPERBATCH on the number of requests batched.
Most of the performance benefit occurs in the first few merged requests.
Note that
ID="IX-1002-C-109"FlushGCFlushGC()
is called before picking up the value of last_req,
because it may modify this field.ID="S1-1002-C-5"Writing Extension StubsAll X requests always contain the length of the request,
expressed as a 16-bit quantity of 32 bits.
This means that a single request can be no more than 256K bytes in
length.
Some servers may not support single requests of such a length.
The value of dpy->max_request_size contains the maximum length as
defined by the server implementation.

<Xproto.h>file contains three sets of definitions that

request names, request structures, and reply structures.You need to generate a file equivalent to
ID="IX-1002-C-112"Xproto.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-113"include filesXproto.h
<Xproto.h>for your extension and need to include it in your stub routine.

<Xlibint.h>.The identifiers are deliberately chosen in such a way that, if the

xDoSomethingReq, and its reply is xDoSomethingReply.
The GetReq family of macros, defined in
ID="IX-1002-C-116"Xlibint.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-117"include filesXlibint.h

<Xproto.h>that looks similar to this:ID="SC-1002-C-42"#define X_DoSomething   42In your extension header file this will be a minor opcode,
rather than a major opcode.ID="S2-1002-C-9"Request FormatEvery request contains an 8-bit major opcode and a 16-bit length field
expressed in units of four bytes.
Every request consists of four bytes of header
(containing the major opcode, the length field, and a data byte) followed by
zero or more additional bytes of data.
The length field defines the total length of the request, including the header.
The length field in a request must equal the minimum length required to contain
the request.
If the specified length is smaller or larger than the required length,
the server should generate a
ID="IX-1002-C-120"BadLengthBadLength
error.
Unused bytes in a request are not required to be zero.
Extensions should be designed in such a way that long protocol requests
can be split up into smaller requests,
if it is possible to exceed the maximum request size of the server.
The protocol guarantees the maximum request size to be no smaller than
4096 units (16384 bytes).Major opcodes 128 through 255 are reserved for extensions.
Extensions are intended to contain multiple requests,
so extension requests typically have an additional minor opcode encoded
in the "spare" data byte in the request header,
but the placement and interpretation of this minor opcode as well as all
other fields in extension requests are not defined by the core protocol.
Every request is implicitly assigned a sequence number (starting with one)
used in replies, errors, and events.To help but not cure portability problems to certain machines, the
ID="IX-1002-C-121"B16B16
and
ID="IX-1002-C-122"B32B32
macros have been defined so that they can become bitfield specifications
on some machines.
For example, on a Cray,
these should be used for all 16-bit and 32-bit quantities, as discussed below.Most protocol requests have a corresponding structure typedef in
ID="IX-1002-C-123"Xproto.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-124"include filesXproto.h
<Xproto.h>,
which looks like:
ID="IX-1002-C-125"xDoSomethingReqID="SC-1002-C-43"typedef struct _DoSomethingReq {
    CARD8 reqType;        /* X_DoSomething */
    CARD8 someDatum;      /* used differently in different requests */
    CARD16 length B16;    /* total # of bytes in request, divided by 4 */
    ...
    /* request-specific data */
    ...
} xDoSomethingReq;If a core protocol request has a single 32-bit argument,
you need not declare a request structure in your extension header file.
Instead, such requests use
<Xproto.h>'s
ID="IX-1002-C-126"xResourceReqxResourceReq
structure.
This structure is used for any request whose single argument is a
ID="IX-1002-C-127"WindowWindow,
ID="IX-1002-C-128"Pixmap typePixmap,
ID="IX-1002-C-129"Drawable data typeDrawable,

ID="IX-1002-C-134"AtomAtom,
or
ID="IX-1002-C-135"VisualIDVisualID.
ID="IX-1002-C-136"xResourceReqID="SC-1002-C-44"typedef struct _ResourceReq {
    CARD8 reqType;     /* the request type, e.g., X_DoSomething */
    BYTE pad;          /* not used */
    CARD16 length B16; /* 2 (= total # of bytes in request, divided by 4) */
    CARD32 id B32;     /* the Window, Drawable, Font, GContext, etc. */
} xResourceReq;If convenient,
you can do something similar in your extension header file.In both of these structures,
the reqType field identifies the type of the request (for example,
X_MapWindow or X_CreatePixmap).
The length field tells how long the request is
in units of 4-byte longwords.
This length includes both the request structure itself and any
variable length data, such as strings or lists, that follow the
request structure.
Request structures come in different sizes,
but all requests are padded to be multiples of four bytes long.A few protocol requests take no arguments at all.
Instead, they use
<Xproto.h>'s
ID="IX-1002-C-137"xReqxReq
structure, which contains only a reqType and a length (and a pad byte).If the protocol request requires a reply,
then
ID="IX-1002-C-138"Xproto.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-139"include filesXproto.h
<Xproto.h>also contains a reply structure typedef:
ID="IX-1002-C-140"xDoSomethingReplyID="SC-1002-C-45"typedef struct _DoSomethingReply {
    BYTE type;                 /* always X_Reply */
    BYTE someDatum;            /* used differently in different requests */
    CARD16 sequenceNumber B16; /* # of requests sent so far */
    CARD32 length B32;         /* # of additional bytes, divided by 4 */
    ...
    /* request-specific data */
    ...
} xDoSomethingReply;Most of these reply structures are 32 bytes long.
If there are not that many reply values,
then they contain a sufficient number of pad fields
to bring them up to 32 bytes.
The length field is the total number of bytes in the request minus 32,
divided by 4.
This length will be nonzero only if:MARK="BULLET"The reply structure is followed by variable length
data such as a list or string.The reply structure is longer than 32 bytes.Only

and
ID="IX-1002-C-144"XGetKeyboardControlXGetKeyboardControl
have reply structures longer than 32 bytes in the core protocol.A few protocol requests return replies that contain no data.
ID="IX-1002-C-145"Xproto.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-146"include filesXproto.h
<Xproto.h>does not define reply structures for these.
Instead, they use the
ID="IX-1002-C-147"xGenericReplyxGenericReply
structure, which contains only a type, length,
and sequence number (and sufficient padding to make it 32 bytes long).ID="S2-1002-C-10"Starting to Write a Stub RoutineAn Xlib stub routine should always start like this:ID="SC-1002-C-46"#include "Xlibint.h"
XDoSomething (arguments, ... )
/* argument declarations */
{
register XDoSomethingReq *req;If the protocol request has a reply,
then the variable declarations should include the reply structure for the request.
The following is an example:ID="SC-1002-C-47"xDoSomethingReply rep;ID="S2-1002-C-11"Locking Data StructuresTo lock the display structure for systems that
want to support multithreaded access to a single display connection,
each stub will need to lock its critical section.
Generally, this section is the point from just before the appropriate GetReq
call until all arguments to the call have been stored into the buffer.
The precise instructions needed for this locking depend upon the machine
architecture.
Two calls, which are generally implemented as macros, have been provided.
ID="IX-1002-C-148"LockDisplayID="SC-1002-C-48"LockDisplay(display)
      Display *display;ID="IX-1002-C-149"UnlockDisplayID="SC-1002-C-49"UnlockDisplay(display)
      Display *display;displaySpecifies the connection to the X server.ID="S2-1002-C-12"Sending the Protocol Request and ArgumentsAfter the variable declarations,
a stub routine should call one of four macros defined in
ID="IX-1002-C-150"Xlibint.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-151"include filesXlibint.h
<Xlibint.h>:
ID="IX-1002-C-152"GetReqGetReq(),
ID="IX-1002-C-153"GetReqExtraGetReqExtra(),
ID="IX-1002-C-154"GetResReqGetResReq(),
or
ID="IX-1002-C-155"GetEmptyReqGetEmptyReq().
All of these macros take, as their first argument,
the name of the protocol request as declared in
ID="IX-1002-C-156"Xproto.h include fileID="IX-1002-C-157"include filesXproto.h
<Xproto.h>except with X_ removed.
Each one declares a
ID="IX-1002-C-158"Display structureDisplay
structure pointer,
called dpy, and a pointer to a request structure, called req,
which is of the appropriate type.
The macro then appends the request structure to the output buffer,
fills in its type and length field, and sets req to point to it.If the protocol request has no arguments (for instance, X_GrabServer),
then use
ID="IX-1002-C-159"GetEmptyReqGetEmptyReq().ID="SC-1002-C-50"GetEmptyReq (DoSomething, req);If the protocol request has a single 32-bit argument (such as a
ID="IX-1002-C-160"Pixmap typePixmap,
ID="IX-1002-C-161"WindowWindow,
ID="IX-1002-C-162"Drawable data typeDrawable,
ID="IX-1002-C-163"AtomAtom,
and so on),
then use
ID="IX-1002-C-164"GetResReqGetResReq().
The second argument to the macro is the 32-bit object.
ID="IX-1002-C-165"X_MapWindow
X_MapWindow
is a good example.ID="SC-1002-C-51"GetResReq (DoSomething, rid, req);The rid argument is the
ID="IX-1002-C-166"Pixmap typePixmap,
ID="IX-1002-C-167"WindowWindow,
or other resource ID.If the protocol request takes any other argument list,
then call
ID="IX-1002-C-168"GetReqGetReq().
After the
ID="IX-1002-C-169"GetReqGetReq(),
you need to set all the other fields in the request structure,
usually from arguments to the stub routine.ID="SC-1002-C-52"GetReq (DoSomething, req);
/* fill in arguments here */
req->arg1 = arg1;
req->arg2 = arg2;A few stub routines (such as
ID="IX-1002-C-170"XCreateGCXCreateGC()
and
ID="IX-1002-C-171"XCreatePixmapXCreatePixmap())
return a resource ID to the caller but pass a resource ID as an argument
to the protocol request.
Such routines use the macro
ID="IX-1002-C-172"XAllocIDXAllocID
to allocate a resource ID from the range of IDs
that were assigned to this client when it opened the connection.ID="SC-1002-C-53"rid = req->rid = XAllocID();
return (rid);Finally, some stub routines transmit a fixed amount of variable length
data after the request.
Typically, these routines (such as
ID="IX-1002-C-173"XMoveWindowXMoveWindow()
and
ID="IX-1002-C-174"XSetBackgroundXSetBackground())
are special cases of more general functions like
ID="IX-1002-C-175"XMoveResizeWindowXMoveResizeWindow()
and
ID="IX-1002-C-176"XChangeGCXChangeGC().
These special case routines use
ID="IX-1002-C-177"GetReqExtraGetReqExtra(),
which is the same as
ID="IX-1002-C-178"GetReqGetReq
except that it takes an additional argument (the number of
extra bytes to allocate in the output buffer after the request structure).
This number should always be a multiple of four.ID="S2-1002-C-13"Variable Length ArgumentsSome protocol requests take additional variable length data that
follow the
ID="IX-1002-C-179"xDoSomethingReqxDoSomethingReq
structure.
The format of this data varies from request to request.
Some requests require a sequence of 8-bit bytes,
others a sequence of 16-bit or 32-bit entities,
and still others a sequence of structures.It is necessary to add the length of any variable length data to the
length field of the request structure.
That length field is in units of 32-bit longwords.
If the data is a string or other sequence of 8-bit bytes,
then you must round the length up and shift it before adding:ID="SC-1002-C-54"req->length += (nbytes+3)>>2;To transmit variable length data, use the
ID="IX-1002-C-180"DataData
macros.
If the data fits into the output buffer,
then this macro copies it to the buffer.
If it does not fit, however,
the
ID="IX-1002-C-181"DataData
macro calls
ID="IX-1002-C-182"_XSend_XSend(),
which transmits first the contents of the buffer and then your data.
The
ID="IX-1002-C-183"DataData
macros take three arguments:
the Display, a pointer to the beginning of the data,
and the number of bytes to be sent.ID="SC-1002-C-55"Data(display, (char *) data, nbytes);
Data16(display, (short *) data, nbytes);
Data32(display, (long *) data, nbytes);ID="IX-1002-C-184"DataData(),
ID="IX-1002-C-185"Data16Data16(),
and
ID="IX-1002-C-186"Data32Data32()
are macros that may use their last argument
more than once, so that argument should be a variable rather than
an expression such as "nitems*sizeof(item)".
You should do that kind of computation in a separate statement before calling
them.
Use the appropriate macro when sending byte, short, or long data.If the protocol request requires a reply,
then call the procedure
ID="IX-1002-C-187"_XSend_XSend
instead of the
ID="IX-1002-C-188"DataData
macro.
_XSend
takes the same arguments, but because it sends your data immediately instead of
copying it into the output buffer (which would later be flushed
anyway by the following call on
ID="IX-1002-C-189"_XReply_XReply()),
it is faster.ID="S2-1002-C-14"RepliesIf the protocol request has a reply,
then call
_XReply
after you have finished dealing with
all the fixed and variable length arguments.
_XReply
flushes the output buffer and waits for an
ID="IX-1002-C-190"xReplyxReply
packet to arrive.
If any events arrive in the meantime,
_XReply
places them in the queue for later use.ID="SC-1002-C-56"Status _XReply(display, rep, extra, discard)

specified rep.
_XReply
handles error and event packets that occur before the reply is received.
_XReply
takes four arguments:MARK="BULLET"A
ID="IX-1002-C-191"Display structureDisplay
* structureA pointer to a reply structure (which must be cast to an
ID="IX-1002-C-192"xReplyxReply *)The number of additional 32-bit words (beyond

sizeof(xReply)
= 32 bytes)
in the reply structureA Boolean that indicates whether
ID="IX-1002-C-194"_XReply_XReply
is to discard any additional bytes
beyond those it was told to readBecause most reply structures are 32 bytes long,
the third argument is usually 0.
The only core protocol exceptions are the replies to
ID="IX-1002-C-195"XGetWindowAttributesXGetWindowAttributes(),
ID="IX-1002-C-196"XQueryFontXQueryFont(),
ID="IX-1002-C-197"XQueryKeymapXQueryKeymap(),
and
ID="IX-1002-C-198"XGetKeyboardControlXGetKeyboardControl(),
which have longer replies.The last argument should be
ID="IX-1002-C-199"FalseFalse
if the reply structure is followed
by additional variable length data (such as a list or string).
It should be
ID="IX-1002-C-200"TrueTrue
if there is not any variable length data.This last argument is provided for upward-compatibility reasons
to allow a client to communicate properly with a hypothetical later
version of the server that sends more data than the client expected.
For example, some later version of
ID="IX-1002-C-201"GetWindowAttributesXGetWindowAttributes
might use a
larger, but compatible,
ID="IX-1002-C-202"xGetWindowAttributesReplyxGetWindowAttributesReply
that contains additional attribute data at the end.ID="IX-1002-C-203"_XReply_XReplyreturns
ID="IX-1002-C-204"TrueTrue
if it received a reply successfully or
ID="IX-1002-C-205"FalseFalse
if it received any sort of error.For a request with a reply that is not followed by variable length
data, you write something like:ID="SC-1002-C-57"_XReply(display, (xReply *)&rep, 0, True);
*ret1 = rep.ret1;
*ret2 = rep.ret2;
*ret3 = rep.ret3;
UnlockDisplay()(dpy);
SyncHandle();
return (rep.ret4);
}If there is variable length data after the reply,
change the

For further information,
see the Xlib sources for examples.ID="S2-1002-C-15"Synchronous CallingTo ease debugging,
each routine should have a call, just before returning to the user,
to a routine called
ID="IX-1002-C-214"SyncHandleSyncHandle().
This routine generally is implemented as a macro.
If synchronous mode is enabled (see
ID="IX-1002-C-215"XSynchronizeXSynchronize()),
the request is sent immediately.
The library, however, waits until any error the routine could generate
at the server has been handled.ID="S2-1002-C-16"Allocating and Deallocating MemoryTo support the possible reentry of these routines,
you must observe several conventions when allocating and deallocating memory,
most often done when returning data to the user from the window
system of a size the caller could not know in advance
(for example, a list of fonts or a list of extensions).
The standard C library routines on many systems
are not protected against signals or other multithreaded uses.
The following analogies to standard I/O library routines
have been defined:Xmalloc()Replaces malloc().XFree()Replaces free().Xcalloc()Replaces calloc().These should be used in place of any calls you would make to the normal
C library routines.If you need a single scratch buffer inside a critical section
(for example, to pack and unpack data to and from the wire protocol),
the general memory allocators
may be too expensive to use (particularly in output routines, which
are performance critical).
The routine below returns a scratch buffer for your use:
ID="IX-1002-C-216"_XAllocScratchID="SC-1002-C-63"char *_XAllocScratch(display, nbytes)
      Display *display;
      unsigned long nbytes;displaySpecifies the connection to the X server.nbytesSpecifies the number of bytes required.This storage must only be used inside of the critical section of your
stub.ID="S2-1002-C-17"Portability ConsiderationsMany machine architectures,
including many of the more recent RISC architectures,
do not correctly access data at unaligned locations;
their compilers pad out structures to preserve this characteristic.
Many other machines capable of unaligned references pad inside of structures
as well to preserve alignment, because accessing aligned data is
usually much faster.
Because the library and the server use structures to access data at
arbitrary points in a byte stream,
all data in request and reply packets must be naturally aligned;
that is, 16-bit data starts on 16-bit boundaries in the request
and 32-bit data on 32-bit boundaries.
All requests must be a multiple of 32 bits in length to preserve
the natural alignment in the data stream.
You must pad structures out to 32-bit boundaries.
Pad information does not have to be zeroed unless you want to
preserve such fields for future use in your protocol requests.
Floating point varies radically between machines and should be
avoided completely if at all possible.This code may run on machines with 16-bit ints.
So, if any integer argument, variable, or return value either can take
only nonnegative values or is declared as a CARD16 in the protocol,
be sure to declare it as unsigned int and not as int.
(This, of course, does not apply to Booleans or enumerations.)Similarly,
if any integer argument or return value is declared CARD32 in the protocol,
declare it as an unsigned long and not as int or long.
This also goes for any internal variables that may
take on values larger than the maximum 16-bit unsigned int.The library currently assumes that a char is 8 bits,
a short is 16 bits, an int is 16 or 32 bits, and a long is 32 bits.
The
ID="IX-1002-C-217"PackDataPackData
macro is a half-hearted attempt to deal with the possibility of 32 bit shorts.
However, much more work is needed to make this work properly.ID="S2-1002-C-18"Deriving the Correct Extension OpcodeThe remaining problem a writer of an extension stub routine faces that
the core protocol does not face is to map from the call to the proper
major and minor opcodes.
While there are a number of strategies,
the simplest and fastest is outlined below.NUMERATION="ARABIC"Declare an array of pointers, _NFILE long (this is normally found
in
ID="IX-1002-C-218"stdio.h
<stdio.h>and is the number of file descriptors supported on the system)
of type
ID="IX-1002-C-219"XExtCodesXExtCodes().
Make sure these are all initialized to NULL.When your stub is entered, your initialization test is just to use
the display pointer passed in to access the file descriptor and an index
into the array.
If the entry is NULL, then this is the first time you
are entering the routine for this display.
Call your initialization routine and pass it to the display pointer.Once in your initialization routine, call
ID="IX-1002-C-220"XInitExtensionXInitExtension();
if it succeeds, store the pointer returned into this array.
Make sure to establish a close display handler to allow you to zero the entry.
Do whatever other initialization your extension requires.
(For example, install event handlers and so on.)
Your initialization routine would normally return a pointer to the
ID="IX-1002-C-221"XExtCodesXExtCodes
structure for this extension, which is what would normally
be found in your array of pointers.After returning from your initialization routine,
the stub can now continue normally, because it has its major opcode safely
in its hand in the
ID="IX-1002-C-222"XExtCodesXExtCodes
structure.ID="AX-1002-D-1" NUMBER="D"The basecalc ApplicationAppendix D: The basecalc ApplicationThis appendix lists the complete source code for the basecalc

described here before we go into the event-specific members (see also 
Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual, LINKEND="S2-1002-8-2"Section 8.2.2, "Event Types and XEvent Union").

} XAnyEvent;The first member of the XEvent union is the type of event.
When an event is received (with XNextEvent, for example),
the application checks the type member in the XEvent 
union.  Then the specific event type is known and the specific event 
structure (such as xbutton) is used to access information 
specific to that event type.ID="IX-1002-E-3"event membersBefore the branching depending on the event type, only the XEvent
union is used.  After the branching, only the event structure which 
contains the specific information for each event type should be used 
in each branch.  For example, if the XEvent union were called 
report, the report.xexpose structure should be used 
within the branch for Expose events.You will notice that each event structure also begins with a type 
member.  This member is rarely used, since it is an identical copy of the 
type member in the XEvent union.Most event structures also have a window member.  The only
ones that do not are certain selection events 
(SelectionNotify and SelectionRequest) and events 
selected by the graphics_exposures member of the GC
(GraphicsExpose and NoExpose).  The windowID="IX-1002-E-4"eventsstructure
member indicates the event window that selected and received the event.
This is the window where the event arrives if it has propagated through 
the hierarchy as described in 
LINKEND="S2-1002-8-9"Section 8.3.2, "Propagation of Device Events", of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual.  
One event type may have two different meanings to an application, 
depending on which window it appears in.Many of the event structures also have a display and/or 
root member.  The display member identifies the 
connection to the server that is active.  The root member 
indicates which screen the window that received the event is linked 
to in the hierarchy.  Most programs only use a single screen and therefore 
do not need to worry about the root member.  The display 
member can be useful, since you can pass the display variable into routines 
by simply passing a pointer to the event structure, eliminating the need 
for a separate display argument.  All event structures include a serial member that gives the 
number of the last protocol request processed by the server.  This is 
useful in debugging, since an error can be detected by the server but 
not reported to the user (or programmer) until the next routine that 
gets an event.  That means several routines may execute successfully 
after the error occurs.  The last request processed will often indicate
the request that contained the error.All event structures also include a send_event flag, which, if 
True, indicates that the event was sent by XSendEvent 
(i.e., by another client rather than by the server).The following pages describe each event type in detail.  The events
are presented in alphabetical order, each on a separate page.  Each
page describes the circumstances under which the event is generated,
the mask used to select it, the structure itself, its members, and
useful programming notes.  Note that the description of the structure
members does not include those members common to many structures.  If
you need more information on these members, please refer to this

Time is declared as unsignedlong, so it 
wraps around when it reaches the maximum value of a 32-bit number 
(every 49.7 days).x, yIf the receiving window is on the same screen as the root window specified 
by root, then x and y are the pointer coordinates 
relative to the receiving window's origin.  Otherwise, x and 
y are zero.
When active button grabs and pointer grabs are in effect 
(see 9.4 of Volume One, Xlib Programming Manual), the coordinates relative 
to the receiving window may not be within the 
window (they may be negative or greater than window height or width).x_root, y_rootThe pointer coordinates relative to the root window which is an ancestor
of the event window.  If the pointer was on a different screen, these are zero.stateThe state of all the buttons and modifier keys just before the 
event, represented by a mask of the button and modifier key 
symbols:  Button1Mask, Button2Mask, Button3Mask, 
Button4Mask, Button5Mask, ControlMask, 
LockMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, 
Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask, and ShiftMask.  
If a modifier key is pressed and released when no other modifier keys 
are held, the ButtonPress will have a state member of 
0 and the ButtonRelease will have a non-zero state member 
indicating that itself was held just before the event.buttonA value indicating which button changed state to trigger this event.  
One of the constants:  Button1, Button2, Button3, 
Button4, or Button5.same_screenIndicates whether the pointer is currently on the same screen as this 
window.  This is always True unless the pointer was actively 
grabbed before the automatic grab could take place.ID="R1-1002-BUTTONPRESS-6"NotesUnless an active grab already exists or a passive grab on the button 
combination that was pressed already exists at a higher level in the 
hierarchy than where the ButtonPress occurred, an automatic 
active grab of the pointer takes place when a ButtonPress occurs.  
Because of the automatic grab, the matching ButtonRelease is 
sent to the same application that received the ButtonPress event.  
If OwnerGrabButtonMask has been selected, the ButtonRelease 
event is delivered to the window which contained the pointer when the 
button was released, as long as that window belongs to the same client 
as the window in which the ButtonPress event occurred.  If the 
ButtonRelease occurs outside of the client's windows or
OwnerGrabButtonMask was not selected, the ButtonRelease 
is delivered to the window in which the ButtonPress occurred.
The grab is terminated when all buttons are released.  During the grab, 
the cursor associated with the grabbing window will track the pointer 
anywhere on the screen.If the application has invoked a passive button grab on an ancestor of 
the window in which the ButtonPress event occurs, then that grab 
takes precedence over the automatic grab, and the ButtonRelease 
will go to that window, or it will be handled normally by that client 
depending on the owner_events flag in the XGrabButton call.ID="RE-1002-CIRCULATENOTIFY-1"CirculateNotifyxcirculateID="RN-1002-CIRCULATENOTIFY-1"CirculateNotify(generated event).ID="RS-1002-CIRCULATENOTIFY-1"ID="R1-1002-CIRCULATENOTIFY-1"When GeneratedID="IX-1002-CIRCULATENOTIFY-1"CirculateNotify eventID="IX-1002-CIRCULATENOTIFY-2"eventsCirculateNotify

mode NotifyNormal, events caused by a grab have mode 
NotifyGrab, and events caused by a released grab have 
mode NotifyUngrab.detailThe value of the detail member depends on the hierarchical 
relationship between the origin and destination windows and the 
direction of pointer transfer.  Determining which windows receive
events and with which detail members is quite complicated.
This topic is described in the next section.same_screenIndicates whether the pointer is currently on the same screen as 
this window.  This is always True unless the pointer was 
actively grabbed before the automatic grab could take place.focusIf the receiving window is the focus window or a descendant of the

Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask, and ShiftMask. ID="R1-1002-ENTERNOTIFY-6"Virtual Crossing and the detail MemberVirtual crossing occurs when the pointer moves between two 
windows that do not have a parent-child relationship.  Windows 
between the origin and destination windows in the hierarchy 
receive EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events.
The detail member of each of these events depends on
the hierarchical relationship of the origin and destination 
windows and the direction of pointer transfer.  Virtual crossing is an advanced topic that you should not spend 
time figuring out unless you have an important reason to use it.
We have never seen an application that uses this feature, and we 
know of no reason for its extreme complexity.  With that word of 
warning, proceed.Let's say the pointer has moved from one window, the origin, to 
another, the destination.  First, we'll specify what types of events 
each window gets and then the detail member of each of those events.The window of origin receives a LeaveNotify event and the 
destination window receives an EnterNotify event, if they 
have requested this type of event.  If one is an inferior of the 
other, the detail member of the event received by the 
inferior is NotifyAncestor and the detail of the event 
received by the superior is NotifyInferior.  If the crossing 
is between parent and child, these are the only events generated.However, if the origin and destination windows are not parent and 
child, other windows are virtually crossed and also receive 
ID="IX-1002-ENTERNOTIFY-7"virtual crossing
events.  If neither window is an ancestor of the other, ancestors 
of each window, up to but not including the least common ancestor,
receive LeaveNotify events, if they are in the same branch 
of the hierarchy as the origin, and EnterNotify events, if 
they are in the same branch as the destination.  These events can 
be used to track the motion of the pointer through the hierarchy.∑In the case of a crossing between a parent and a child of a child, 
the middle child receives a LeaveNotify with detail
NotifyVirtual.∑In the case of a crossing between a child and the parent of its 
parent, the middle child receives an EnterNotify with 
detail NotifyVirtual.∑In a crossing between windows whose least common ancestor is two or 
more windows away, both the origin and destination windows receive 
events with detail NotifyNonlinear.  The windows between 
the origin and the destination in the hierarchy, up to but not 
including their least common ancestor, receive events with detail 
NotifyNonlinearVirtual.  The least common ancestor is the 
lowest window from which both are descendants.∑If the origin and destination windows are on separate screens, the
events and details generated are the same as for two windows not
parent and child, except that the root windows of the two screens
are considered the least common ancestor.  Both root windows also 
receive events.LINKEND="TB-1002-E-1"Table E-1 shows the event types generated by a pointer crossing from

generate several exposure events on one window or on several windows.
The server guarantees that all exposure events generated from a single 
action will be sent contiguously, so that they can all be handled 
before moving on to other event types.  This allows an application 
to keep track of the rectangles specified in contiguous Expose 
events, set the clip_mask in a GC to the areas specified in 
the rectangle using XSetRegion or XSetClipRectangles, 
and then finally redraw the window clipped with the GC in a single 
operation after all the Expose events have arrived.  The last 
event to arrive is indicated by a count of 0.  In Release 2, 
XUnionRectWithRegion can be used to add the rectangle in 
Expose events to a region before calling XSetRegion.If your application is able to redraw partial windows, you can also 
read each exposure event in turn and redraw each area.

window that receives the event and the origin and destination windows.
It will be described in detail after the description of which windows 
get what types of events.ID="R1-1002-FOCUSIN-6"NotesThe keyboard focus is a window that has been designated as the 
one to receive all keyboard input irrespective of the pointer position.  
Only the keyboard focus window and its descendants receive keyboard 
events.  By default, the focus window is the root window.  Since all 
windows are descendants of the root, the pointer controls the window 
that receives input.Most window managers allow the user to set a focus window to avoid 
the problem where the pointer sometimes gets bumped into the wrong 
window and your typing does not go to the intended window.  If the 
pointer is pointing at the root window, all typing is usually lost, 
since there is no application for this input to propagate to.  Some 
applications may set the keyboard focus so that they can get all 
keyboard input for a given period of time, but this practice is 
not encouraged.Focus events are used when an application wants to act differently
when the keyboard focus is set to another window or to itself.
FocusChangeMask is used to select FocusIn and 
FocusOut events.
ID="IX-1002-FOCUSIN-7"XSetInputFocusWhen a focus change occurs, a FocusOut event is delivered 
to the old focus window and a FocusIn event is delivered 
to the window which receives the focus.  Windows in between in the 
hierarchy are virtually crossed and receive one focus change event 
each depending on the relationship and direction of transfer between 
the origin and destination windows.  Some or all of the windows 
between the window containing the pointer at the time of the focus
change and that window's root window can also receive focus change 
events.  By checking the detail member of FocusIn 
and FocusOut events, an application can tell which of its 
windows can receive input.The detail member gives clues about the relationship 
of the event receiving window to the origin and destination 
of the focus.  The detail member of FocusIn 
and FocusOut events is analogous to the detail 
member of EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events 
but with even more permutations to make life complicated.ID="R1-1002-FOCUSIN-7"Virtual Focus Crossing and the detail MemberWe will now embark on specifying the types of events sent to each 
window and the detail member in each event, depending on 
the relative position in the hierarchy of the origin window (old 
focus), destination window (new focus), and the pointer window 
(window containing pointer at time of focus change).  Don't even 
try to figure this out unless you have to.E-3 shows the event types generated by a focus transition

functions in useful ways.  This appendix summarizes the available
functions.  See Appendix J of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual,
for detailed reference pages for each function.
(After mid-1992, these reference pages may
be moved to a new volume, Extensions and Utilities.)ID="IX-1002-F-1" SPAN="START"Xmu libraryID="IX-1002-F-2"Xmu librarydescriptionThe Xmu Library is a collection of miscellaneous (some might say random)
utility functions that have been useful in building various applications
and Xt Toolkit widgets.  Though not defined by any X Consortium standard,
this library is written and supported by MIT in the core distribution
and therefore should be available on most machines.The functions in Xmu are briefly described here in several
categories:  atom manipulation, error handlers, system utilities,
window utilities, cursor utilities, color utilities, pixmap
utilities, graphics
functions, selection
functions, character set functions, compound text functions, close
display functions, event queue functions, and standard colormap
functions.  For detailed calling sequences for these functions,
see Appendix J, The Xmu Library, of Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual.At each release, the number and variety of functions in this library
have increased dramatically.  Even if you are familiar with
the contents of Xmu in an earlier release, it is worthwhile skimming
this appendix.Each of the groups of functions listed below has its own header file.
The Xmu header files are located (by default on
UNIX-based systems) in /usr/include/X11/Xmu.ID="S1-1002-F-1"Atom FunctionsID="IX-1002-F-3" SPAN="START"Xmu libraryatom functionsID="IX-1002-F-4" SPAN="START"atomsfunctions in Xmu libraryThese functions allow an application to use various properties that do
not have predefined atoms, without having to maintain a global variable
to store the atom.  Instead Xmu handles calling XInternAtom() on
the first reference and caches the value for all further references.
For example, after initializing Xmu's atom-caching facility (with the
arcane invocation XmuInternAtom(display, XmuMakeAtom("NULL"))),
you can get the atom for any property that Xmu knows about, such as
CLIPBOARD, simply by using the phrase XA_CLIPBOARD(display).

default error message for protocol errors.  It returns a nonzero value
if the caller should consider exiting; otherwise, it returns 0.  This
function can be used when you need to write your own error handler but
need to print out an error from within that handler.XmuSimpleErrorHandler() is an error handler function you can
use in place of the default protocol error handler.  It ignores
BadWindow errors for XQueryTree() and
XGetWindowAttributes() and ignores BadDrawable errors
for XGetGeometry(); it returns 0 in those cases.  Otherwise,
it prints the default error message and returns a nonzero value if
the caller should consider exiting and 0 if the caller should not exit.

window which has a WM_STATE property.  If such a window is
found, it is returned; otherwise, the argument window is returned.
This is used by window managers.XmuUpdateMapHints() is a convenience routine for setting
ID="IX-1002-F-18"Xmu libraryXmuUpdateMapHints
(by applications) and reading (by the window manager) the
XA_WM_NORMAL_HINTS property.  It clears the PPosition
and PSize flags and sets the USPosition and
USSize flags in the hints structure and then stores the
hints for the window using XSetWMNormalHints() and returns
True.  If NULL is passed for the hints structure,
then the current hints are read back from the window using
XGetWMNormalHints() and are used instead and True
is returned; otherwise, False is returned.

exception of read-only allocations of colors, which fail to return
the expected pixel value, and these are individually defined as
read/write allocations.  This is done so that all the cells defined
in the colormap are contiguous, for use in image processing.  This

and about X in general, including other books on the subject and the
various ways to get the source code for X.This appendix lists a few of the official and unofficial sources for
information about the X Window System and associated software.Note that some of this detailed information may become dated rather quickly.
The best source of current information is the comp.windows.x network
news group, described later in this appendix.ID="S1-1002-G-1"Getting the X SoftwareAt this writing, the current public release level is Release 5.  This book
documents Release 4 and Release 5.  Many people will continue to use
R4 for a while, since there is a considerable lag time between the
date that MIT distributes a new release and the date by which vendors
integrate that release into their
own products and issue updates.  All changes to Xlib in R5 are backwards
compatible, although there are many new interfaces that provide
additional capabilities.You can get the X software directly from MIT on three 9-track 1600-BPI
magtapes written in UNIX tar format or on one 9-track 6250-BPI
magtape, along with printed copies of MIT's manuals, by sending a check

the price is $500.  The manual set alone is $125, including U.S. shipping,
or $175, including overseas shipping.Other distribution media or formats are not available from the MIT
Software Distribution Center but are from other independent vendors
such as ICS, mentioned later.  The Release tape comes with source code
for sample servers for Apollo, DEC, HP, IBM, Sony, Sun, and several other
workstations, source code for clients written by MIT, sources for the
toolkits Xt, XView, Interviews, and Andrew, contributed software
written outside MIT, and sources and Postscript files for all MIT's
documentation.  Note that the servers supplied are sample servers only;
commercial vendors typically release optimized (faster) servers for the
same machines.Sites that have access to the Internet can retrieve the distribution from

are available from the archive server xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu.
Electronic mail sent to this address is forwarded to a program which
responds with the requested information.  The rest of this section and
the two sections that follow it explain how to use xstuff.ID="IX-1002-G-2" SPAN="START"xstuff serverThe xstuff server is a mail-response program.  This means that you
mail it a request and it mails back the response.The xstuff server is a very dumb program.  It does not have much
error checking.  If you do not send it commands that it understands, it
will just answer "I don't understand you."The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything,
so you can have several different commands in a single message.  It treats
the "Subject:" header line just like any other line of the message.  You
can use any combination of upper and lowercase letters in the commands.The archives are organized into a series of directories and
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory
has an index.  The top-level index gives you an overview of what is
in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you
what it contains.If you are bored with reading documentation and just want to try
something, then send the server a message containing the line:ID="SC-1002-G-1"send index fixesWhen you get the index back, it will contain the numbers of all of
the fixes and batches of fixes in the archive.  Then you can send the
server another message asking it to send you the fixes that you want:ID="SC-1002-G-2"send fixes 1 5 9 11-20If you are using a mailer that understands "@" notation, send to
xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu.  If your mailer deals in "!" notation,
try sending to {someplace}!eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.
For other mailers, you're on your own.The server has four commands.  Each command must be the first word on a line.helpThe command help or send help causes the server to send
you the help file.  No other commands are honored in a message that
asks for help (the server figures that you had better read the help
message before you do anything else).indexIf your message contains a line whose first word is index, then
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the
archive.  If there are other words on that line that match the names
of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent
instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say:ID="SC-1002-G-3"indexor:ID="SC-1002-G-4"index fixesYou can then send back another message to the xstuff server,
using a send command (see below) to ask it to send you the
files whose names you learned from that list.index fixes and send
index fixes mean the same thing:  you
can use send instead of index for getting an index.If your message
has an index or a send index command, then
all other send commands will be ignored.  This means that you cannot
get an index and data in the same request.  This is so that index requests
can be given high priority.sendIf your message contains a line whose first word is send, then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the
line.  To name an item, you give its directory and its name.  For example:ID="SC-1002-G-5"send fixes 1-10Once you have named a category, you can put as many names as you like
on the rest of the line.  They will all be taken from that category.
For example:ID="SC-1002-G-6"send fixes 1-10 11-20 21-30Each send command can reference only one directory.  If you
would like to get one fix and one of something else, you must use
two send commands.You may put as many send commands as you like into one message
to the server, but the more you ask for, the longer it will take to
receive.  See LINKEND="S3-1002-G-2"Section G.1.1.2, "Fairness"" for an explanation.  Actually,
it is not strictly true that you can put as many send commands
as you want into one message.  If the server must use UUCP mail to send
your files, then it cannot send more than 100K bytes in one message.
If you ask for more than it can send, then it will send as much as it
can and ignore the rest.pathThe path command exists to help in case you do not get responses
from the server when you mail to it.Sometimes the server is unable to return mail over the incoming path.
There are dozens of reasons why this might happen, and if you are a
true wizard, you already know what those reasons are.  If you are an
apprentice wizard, you might not know all the reasons, but you might
know a way to circumvent them.If you
put in a path command, then everything that the server
mails to you will be mailed to that address rather than to the return
address on your mail.  The server
host expo.lcs.mit.edu does
not have a direct UUCP connection to anywhere; you must go through
mit-eddie (the UUCP
name of eddie.mit.edu) or somewhere else.ID="S3-1002-G-1"NotesThe xstuff server
acknowledges every request by return mail.
If you do not get a message back in a day or two, you should assume
that something is going wrong and perhaps
try a path command.The xstuff server
does not respond to requests from users named
root, system, daemon, or mailer.  This is to
prevent mail loops.  If your
name is "Bruce Root" or "Jane Daemon"and you can document this, we will happily rewrite the server to remove
this restriction.  Yes, we know about Norman Mailer and Waverley Root.
Norman doesn't use netmail and Waverley is dead.ID="S3-1002-G-2"FairnessThe xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not
monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data.  The mailer is set
up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day.  If
the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent
files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is
run to send its day's quota, it sends the shortest requests out first.If you have a request waiting in the work queue and you send in another
request, the new request is added to the old one (thereby increasing its
size) rather than being filed anew.  This prevents you from being able to
send in a large number of small requests as a way of beating the system.The reason for all of these quotas and limitations is that the delivery
resources are finite, and there are many people who would like to make
use of the archive.

It should
not be long before many different products are available that support X.ID="S1-1002-G-5"Finding Out for YourselfID="IX-1002-G-11"serversguide to server codeX is unusual in that the source code is freely copyable by anyone as
long as the copyright notices are observed.  It should
be possible for most X programmers to get a copy of the X source code
from the sources listed above.  Once you understand how the code is
organized, you can look up certain details about how X works as long as
you have a good knowledge of C and a little persistence.  In "Star Wars,"the saying was "Use the Force, Luke."  In X, it is "Use the Source, Luke."Xlib and the server are two distinct chunks of code.  Each contains code
for sending and receiving information to and from the other over the
network using protocol requests, replies, events, and errors.  The source
tree as supplied on the X distribution tape places the Xlib source in the
directory base/lib/X, where base is the top of the entire
source tree.  Their server source is placed in base/server.The procedure for finding out something about an Xlib routine is
normally to search for the routine in the Xlib code and then figure
out what it does.  Sometimes the answer can be found there.  Many of
the routines, however, simply place their arguments in a protocol
request and send it to the server.  Then you will have to look in the
server code for the answer.  To find the correct place in the server
code, you will need the symbol for the protocol request, which is the
first argument in the GetReq call.The server code is much more involved than Xlib itself.  The
device-dependent portions are in base/server/ddx, and the
device-independent portions are in base/server/dix.  The
device-independent code should be your first stop, because it is here
that protocol requests from Xlib arrive and are dispatched to the
appropriate code.  Search for the protocol request symbol you found
in Xlib.  It will appear in several source files.  Start with the
occurrence in dispatch.c, and try to figure out what the code
does.  This will require following leads to other routines.If you do not find a routine in base/server/dix, then it must be
in the device-dependent code.  base/server/ddx has one directory
in it for each brand of hardware to which a sample server has been
ported.  It also contains the directories /cfb, /mfb,
/mi, and /snf, which contain routines used in writing the
sample server device-dependent code.  Note that servers may
include code ostensibly for other machines.  For example, the Sun sample server
appears to use code in several of the directories for other servers
such as dec and hp.Xlib and the X protocol are both defined by specification documents, not
by any particular implementation.  Never depend on the implementation
details of the Xlib or server code.  If you do, your code may not run on
a machine that has optimized X software.  This manual documents only those
features of Xlib and X in general that are governed by X Consortium standard
specifications.  If you follow the guidance you find in this volume and the
details in Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual, you will be in good shape.ID="AX-1002-H-1" NUMBER="H"Release NotesAppendix H: Release NotesThis appendix describes the changes between recent releases of X
Version 11.  It begins with the changes in the most recent version
and works back.
There were no changes in the underlying X protocol.ID="S1-1002-H-1"Changes from Release 4 to Release 5ID="IX-1002-H-1" SPAN="START"R5conventions, compared to R4ID="IX-1002-H-2" SPAN="START"conventionsR5 compared to R4ID="IX-1002-H-3" SPAN="START"communicationchanges between R4 and R5The major additions in Release 5 were support for
internationalization and support for device-independent color
(the X Color Management System).
There were also a few new resource management functions added
mainly to support the R5 changes in the Xt Intrinsics.ID="S2-1002-H-1"InternationalizationThe largest new part of X11R5 is the support for
writing internationalized programs.  An
internationalized application is one that runs, without
changes to the binary, in any given "locale."  Among
other things, this means that a program must display
all text in the user's language, accept input of all
text in that same language, and display times, dates,
and numbers in the user's accustomed format.The internationalization of terminal-based programs is
a problem that has been
satisfactorily solved where terminals exist that can
display and accept input for a particular language.
The ANSI-C library contains mechanisms for
this terminal-based
internationalization, and X11R5
internationalization is based on these
mechanisms.  Internationalized text input is based on
the concept of an "input method," which is a specialized program
that allows user input of a particular language.  Input methods
are essential for Asian languages where there are more symbols than
can appear on a keyboard.Before beginning, note that the internationalization
features of X11R5 are not self contained, and therefore
may not work on all systems.  If your system does not have the
ANSI-C internationalization features, you may be
able to make do with alternatives provided with the Xlib sample
distribution and by contributed libraries, but these have not been
thoroughly tested and you may encounter
difficulties.  In ANSI-C internationalization,
the C library reads a "localization
database" customized for each
locale.  Many systems (systems sold in the U.S., at least)
support ANSI-C internationalization, but do not
ship databases for any but a default locale.Xlib now provides:MARK="BULLET"Simple locale management functions.Routines for internationalized text-drawing.MARK="DASH"Font set handling functions.Font set metric and string measuring functions.String drawing functions.Respecification of many Xlib functions to clarify
their handling of strings in
internationalized applications.New functions to support internationalized window manager and text
properties for interclient communication.New resource manager functions to support localized databases.Respecifications of many resource manager functions to
make their behavior in internationalized
applications clear.New support for internationalized text input through
input methods.Two sample implementations of all the new Xlib
internationalization functions.The X11R5 distribution provides
two different implementations of the new
internationalization functions.  The default
implementation is named
"Xsi" and is from the OMRON Corporation; the MIT
distribution builds Xsi by default on all but Sony
machines.  Sony systems build the "Ximp" implementation
from Fujitsu, Sony, and others.
Both "Xsi" and "Ximp" implement the same specification, LINKEND="FN-1002-H-1"ID="FN-1002-H-1"These names probably stand for "X sample
implementation" and "X input method protocol."
but
are mutually incompatible.  In particular, the
localization files they read are in very different
formats.ID="S2-1002-H-2"X Color Management SystemXcms defines a new syntax for the color strings used
throughout Xlib, and provides a programming interface that allows
extremely precise control over the allocation of colors.
One feature of Xcms is the provision for a database that maps color
names to device-independent color specifications.  This database
is read by Xlib rather than by the X server.  No sample Xlib-side
database is provided in the MIT distribution.
There is also a new part of the ICCCM, the X Device Color
Characterization Conventions (XDCCC), which are a standard format for
new root window properties that contains the information about the
physical characteristics of the screen necessary to
support the conversion of device-independent color specifications
into device-dependent
ID="IX-1002-H-4"xcmsdb
values.Several existing Xlib functions were modified to
support this new standard syntax for color strings.
The syntax allows color specification in several international standard
color spaces including CIElab, CIEluv, and a simple color space called
TEKhvc.  RGB is also still supported.ID="S2-1002-H-3"Resource ManagementThe character ? may now be used in resource files to
wildcard a single component of a resource name.  This

resources.Resource files may now include other files with a

handling of XListFonts(), XLoadFont(), and
XLoadQueryFont() was changed to allow pattern matching
for scalable fonts.ID="S1-1002-H-2"Miscellaneous Xlib ChangesID="IX-1002-H-18"XPointerID="IX-1002-H-19"caddr_tA new type, XPointer, has been defined to
replace caddr_t, which is not a standard type
and is therefore not necessarily portable.  (The type
XtPointer was added to the X11R4 X Toolkit for
the same reason.)  An
XPointer is a typedef for a char *,
and occurs most noticeably in the XrmValue and
XrmOptionDescRec structures.ID="IX-1002-H-20"XKeysymDB fileID="IX-1002-H-21"keysymsnames
The X11R5 distribution installs the file
XKeysymDB in /usr/lib/X11.
This file contains a list of vendor-private keysyms
names and their corresponding values.  It is required
for the correct operation of many Motif applications
and any application that wants to make use of
vendor-specific keys on a keyboard.  This file was in
the X11R4 distribution, but was not installed by
default.ID="IX-1002-H-22"XFlushGCID="IX-1002-H-23"graphics contextchanges, writing to X server
A new function, XFlushGC(), forces Xlib to write
its cached GC changes to the X server.  For efficiency,
Xlib combines multiple GC changes into a single
server request whenever multiple changes to a GC occur
before a use of that GC.  It is possible for extensions
to X to use GCs in ways that Xlib is not aware of, and
this can mean that requests made by the extension
client library may not operate with the expected
contents of the GC.  XFlushGC() is provided to
address this problem.ID="IX-1002-H-24"XErrorEventThe XErrorEvent structure used by Xlib contains
only 32 bits of data specific to the error, which is
usually used to return a resource ID.  This is
sufficient for all core X errors, but may not be enough
for extensions (notably PEX).
There is plenty of room in the protocol error
structure that is transmitted between server and
client, but Xlib truncates this information when
converting the protocol error into an XErrorEvent
structure.  Since the XErrorEvent structure is smaller
than the XEvent union of which it is a part, an
XErrorEvent can be cast into a larger structure with
more room for error values, and the workaround provided
by X11R5 takes advantage of this fact.  X11R5 provides
two new functions, XESetWireToError() and
XESetPrintErrorValues(), which allow an extension
library to register a function to convert a
protocol error into some type longer than an
XErrorEvent, and to
display an error message
that makes use of the additional data in the special
error message.

required window manager properties.  This function now sets the
WM_HINTS and WM_CLASS properties, in addition to
the properties set under R3 by XSetStandardProperties().
Furthermore, the window name and icon name arguments are now
XTextProperty structures that can be filled with the
new function XStringListToTextProperty(), described below.All string properties to be set for the window manager have been
changed to use XTextProperty structures so that they can
use non-Western encodings (which require more than the eight bits
of data provided in the R3 STRING property).  For this reason,

XGetWMName() replaces XFetchName(), and
XSetWMName() replaces XStoreName().XGetCommand() was added to make it easier for window
managers to read the XA_WM_COMMAND property.  In R3,
XSetCommand() was provided but no XGetCommand().ID="IX-1002-H-40"XSizeHints structureID="IX-1002-H-41"structuresXSizeHints
Three new fields have been added to the XSizeHints structure.
Two, base_width and base_height, basically supercede
the min_width and min_height fields.  The x,
y, width, and height fields of XSizeHints
are no longer used.  Instead these values are simply set when creating
the top-level window (and the window manager gets these values through
substructure redirection in CreateNotify and MapNotify
events). The other new field, win_gravity, allows an application
to specify that some other portion of the window is to be placed when
the window manager allows the user to place windows.  The purpose of
this, for example, is to allow users that display languages that read
from right to left to position the top-right corner of these terminals
instead of their top-left corner.ID="IX-1002-H-42"XWMGeometryID="IX-1002-H-43"XGeometryXWMGeometry replaces XGeometry.  XWMGeometry
calculates geometry values for the top-level window, given a possibly
incomplete user-specified geometry string and a complete application
default geometry specified using an XSizeHints structure.
XWMGeometry also returns a win_gravity value based on
which corner of the top-level window the user or application specified,
suitable for setting into the XSizeHints structure.ID="IX-1002-H-44"XStandardColormap structureID="IX-1002-H-45"structuresXStandardColormap
New fields have been added to the XStandardColormap structure
to return the visual associated with the colormap and also to provide
information about who is allowed to delete the colormap.  To use the
new fields, XGetStandardColormap() is superceded by
XGetRGBColormaps() and XSetStandardColormap()
is superceded by XSetRGBColormaps().The following routines are completely new in R4.ID="IX-1002-H-46"XSetWMClientMachineID="IX-1002-H-47"XGetWMClientMachineXSetWMClientMachine() is used by clients to set a new property
to be read with XGetWMClientMachine() by window or session
managers.  The property stores the name of the machine on which
the client is running, as seen from the server, so that the session
manager can stop and restart the client on the right machine.
See LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."ID="IX-1002-H-48"XSetWMProtocolsID="IX-1002-H-49"XGetWMProtocolsXSetWMProtocols() is used by clients to set a new property
to be read with XGetWMProtocols() by the window manager.
This property indicates which of a number of window manager-client
protocols the client would like to take part in.  Under these protocols,
the window manager sends synthetic events to the client to notify the
client of certain impending conditions, such as that the client has
been granted the keyboard focus or is about to have one of its
windows destroyed or that the entire client is about to be killed.
See LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."ID="IX-1002-H-50"XSetWMColormapWindowsID="IX-1002-H-51"XGetWMColormapWindowsXSetWMColormapWindows() is used by clients to set a new property

fields of structures used in setting the window manager
hints:  XAllocClassHint(), XAllocIconSize(),
XAllocSizeHints(), XAllocStandardColormap(), and
XAllocWMHints().  When using these routines, an application
declares only a pointer to the structure and then uses one of
these routines to allocate the memory.  The purpose of doing this
is to avoid having compiled-in structure sizes, so that fields can
be added to these structures in later releases without causing
binary incompatibility.  See LINKEND="CH-1002-12-1"Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."ID="IX-1002-H-57"XGetGCValuesID="IX-1002-H-58"XIconifyWindowID="IX-1002-H-59"XWithdrawWindowID="IX-1002-H-60"XReconfigureWMWindowXGetGCValues() reads most GC component values out of Xlib's

See LINKEND="CH-1002-5-1"Chapter 5, "The Graphics Context."XIconifyWindow() is to be called by the client to tell the
window manager to iconify a window.  Similarly, XWithdrawWindow()
tells the window manager to unmap a window without iconifying it.
These two routines were added to simplify compliance with the new
ICCCM.  XReconfigureWMWindow() is used by clients to reconfigure

that the set of keysyms that are available in this manner and the
mechanisms by which Xlib obtains them is implementation-dependent.
(In the MIT sample implementation, the resource file

XLookupString() implements new semantics to support keyboard
groups.  Keyboard groups support having two complete sets of keysyms
for a keyboard.  Which set will be used can be toggled using a
particular key.  This is implemented by using the first two keysyms
in the list for a key as one set and the next two keysyms as the
second set.ID="IX-1002-H-92"KeyPress eventID="IX-1002-H-93"eventsKeyPressID="IX-1002-H-94"keysymsand keyboard groups
The standard rules for obtaining a keysym from a KeyPress event
make use of only the Group 1 and Group 2 keysyms; no interpretation of
other keysyms in the list is given here.  Which group to use is determined
by modifier state.  Switching between groups is controlled by the keysym
named MODE SWITCH, by attaching that keysym to some keycode and attaching
that keycode to any one of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5.  This modifier
is called the "group modifier."  For any keycode, Group 1 is used when the
group modifier is off and Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on.Within a group, which keysym to use is also determined by modifier state.
The first keysym is used when the Shift and Lock modifiers are off.  The
second keysym is used when the Shift modifier is on, when the Lock modifier
is on and the second keysym is uppercase alphabetic, or when the Lock
modifier is on and is interpreted as Shift Lock.  Otherwise, when the
Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as Caps Lock, the state of the
Shift modifier is applied first to select a keysym, but if that keysym
is lowercase alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase keysym is
used instead.If the list of Keysyms (ignoring trailing NoSymbol entries)
is a single keysym "K," then the list is treated as if it were
the list "K NoSymbol KNoSymbol."  If the list
(ignoring trailing NoSymbol entries) is a pair of keysyms
"K1 K2," then the list is treated as if it were the list
"K1 K2 K1 K2."  If the list (ignoring trailing NoSymbol
entries) is a triple of keysyms "K1 K2 K3," then the list is
treated as if it were the list "K1 K2 K3NoSymbol."When an explicit "void" element is desired in the list, the value
VoidSymbol can be used.The first four elements of the list are split into two groups of
keysyms.  Group 1 contains the first and second keysyms; Group 2
contains the third and fourth keysyms.  Within each group, if the
second element of the group is NoSymbol, then the group
should be treated as if the second element were the same as the
first element, except when the first element is an alphabetic
keysym "K" for which both lowercase and uppercase forms
are defined.  In that case, the group should be treated as if
the first element were the lowercase form of "K" and the
second element were the uppercase form of "K."No spatial geometry of the symbols on the key is defined by their
order in the keysym list, although a geometry might be defined on
a vendor-specific basis.  The X server does not use the mapping
ID="IX-1002-H-95"mappingkeycodes to keysyms
between keycodes and keysyms.  Rather it stores it merely for
reading and writing by clients.The modifier named Lock is intended to be mapped to either a Caps Lock
or a Shift Lock key, but which one is left as application-specific
and/or user-specific.  However, it is suggested that the determination
be made according to the associated keysym(s) of the corresponding keycode.
ID="IX-1002-H-96" SPAN="END"keyboardgroupsID="IX-1002-H-97" SPAN="END"R4 conventionscompared to R3GlossaryGlossaryX uses many common terms in unique ways.  A good example is
"children."  While most, if not all, of these terms are defined where
they are first used in this book, you will undoubtedly find it easier
to refresh your memory by looking for them here.This glossary is an expanded version of the glossary in
the Xlib-C Language X Interface, by
Jim Gettys, Ron Newman, and Bob Scheifler.access control listID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-1"access control listdefinition
X maintains lists of hosts that are allowed access to each server controlling a display.  By default, only the local host may use the display, plus any hosts specified in the access control list
for that display.  This access control list can be changed by clients on the local host.  Some server implementations may implement other authorization mechanisms in addition to or instead of this one.  The list can currently be found in /etc/X#.hosts, where # is the number of the display.  The access control list is also known as the host access list.active grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-2"active grabdefinition
Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer, and the server can be grabbed for exclusive use by a client, usually for a short time period.  An active grab causes pointer and keyboard events to be sent to the grabbing window regardless of the current position of the pointer.  See passive grab. ancestorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-3"ancestordefinition
If window W is an inferior of window A, then A is an ancestor of W.  The parent window, the parent's parent window, and so on are all ancestors of the given window.  The root window is the ancestor of all windows on a given screen.association tableID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-4"association tablesdefinitionAssociation tables provide a fast lookup table for data that must be searched frequently.  Association tables associate arbitrary information with resource IDs.  This is similar to the context manager, but the resource IDs used with association tables are existing resources, not created for the purpose of storing data for later retrieval.atomID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-5"atomsdefinition
An atom is a unique numeric ID corresponding to a string name. Atoms are used to identify properties, types, and selections in order to avoid the overhead of passing arbitrary length property name strings.backgroundID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-6"backgrounddefinition
The background member of a GC defines a window's background, which consists of either a solid color or a tile pattern.  If a window has a background, it will be repainted automatically by the server whenever there is an Expose event on the window.  If a window does not have a background, it will be transparent.  background
can be set using the GCBackground mask, when the GC is created, or by a call to XSetBackground().  Default is 1. See also foreground. backing storeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-7"backing storedefinition
When a server maintains the contents of a window, the off-screen saved pixels are known as a backing store.  This feature is not available on all servers.  Use the DoesBackingStore()s macro to determine if this feature is supported.base font nameID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-8"base font namedefinition
A font name used to select a family of fonts whose members may be encoded in various charsets. The CharSetRegistry and CharSetEncoding
fields of an XLFD name identify the charset of the font. A base font name may be a full XLFD name, with all fourteen '-' delimiters, or an abbreviated XLFD name containing only the first 13 fields of an  XLFD name, up to but not including CharSetRegistry, with or without the thirteenth '-', or a non-XLFD name. Any XLFD fields may contain wild cards. When creating an XFontSet, Xlib accepts from the client a list of one or more base font names which select one or more font families. They are combined with charset names obtained from the encoding of the locale to load the fonts required to render text.bit gravityID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-9"bit gravitydefinition
When a window is resized, the contents of the window are not necessarily discarded.  It is possible to request the server (though no guarantees are made) to relocate the previous contents to some region of the resized window.  This attraction of window contents for some location of a window is known as bit gravity.  For example, an application that draws a graph might request that the contents be moved into the lower-left corner, so that the origin of the graph will still appear in the lower-left corner.bit planeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-10"bit planedefinition
On a color or gray-scale display, each pixel has more than one bit defined. Data in display memory can be thought of either as pixels (multiple bits per pixel) or as bit planes (one bit plane for each usable bit in the pixel).  The bit plane is an array of bits the size of the screen. bitmapID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-11"bitmapsdefinition
A bitmap is a pixmap with a depth of one bit.  There is no bitmap type in X11.  Instead use a pixmap of depth 1.borderID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-12"bordersdefinition
A window can have a border that is zero or more pixels wide.  If a window has a border, the border can have a solid color or a tile pattern, and it will be repainted automatically by the server whenever its color or pattern is changed or an Expose event occurs on the window. button grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-13"button grabdefinition
Specifies a pointer grab that occurs only when a specified set of keys and/or buttons is held down.  This is analogous to a key grab. See mouse grab. byte orderID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-14"byte orderdefinition
The order in which bytes of data are stored in memory is hardware-dependent. For pixmaps and bitmaps, byte order is defined by the server, and clients with different native byte ordering must swap bytes as necessary. For all other parts of the protocol, the byte order is defined by the client, and the server swaps bytes as necessary.characterID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-15"charactersdefinition
A member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or representation of text (ISO2022, as adapted by XPG3). Note that in ISO2022 terms, a character is not bound to a coded value until it is identified as part of a coded character set.character glyphID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-16"character glyphdefinition
The abstract graphical symbol for a character. Character glyphs may or may not map one-to-one to font glyphs, and may be context-dependent, varying with the adjacent characters. Multiple characters may map to a single character glyph.character setID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-17"character setdefinition
A collection of characters. charsetID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-18"charsetdefinition
An encoding with a uniform, state-independent mapping from characters to codepoints. In the ISO2022 framework, this means a coded character set that does not use any shift sequences. (An encoding which uses single shifts is state-independent, but is not uniform.) For display in X, there can be a direct mapping from a charset to one font, if the width of all characters in the charset is either one or two bytes. A text string encoded in an encoding such as Shift-JIS cannot be passed directly to the X server, because the text imaging requests accept only single-width charsets (either 8 or 16 bits). Charsets which meet these restrictions can serve as "font charsets". Font charsets strictly speaking map font indices to font glyphs, not characters to character glyphs. Note that a single font charset is sometimes used as the encoding of a locale, for example, ISO8859-1.childrenID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-19"childrendefinition
The children of a window are its first-level subwindows.  All of these windows were created with the same window as parent.  A client creates its top-level window as a child of the root window.classID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-20"classdefinition
There are two uses of the term class in X:  window class and visual class.  The window class specifies whether a window is InputOnly or InputOutput. See LINKEND="CH-1002-2-1"Chapter 2, "X Concepts," for details.  The visual class specifies the color model that is used by a window. See LINKEND="CH-1002-7-1"Chapter 7, "Color," for details. clientID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-21"clientdefinition
An application program connects to the window system server by an interprocess communication (IPC) path such as a TCP connection or a shared memory buffer.  This program is referred to as a client
of the window system server.  More precisely, the client is the IPC path itself; a program with multiple paths open to the server is viewed as multiple clients by the protocol.  Server resources survive only as long as the connection remains intact, not as long as a client program remains running.  Normally the connection and the program terminate concurrently, but the client's resources may live on if
XChangeCloseDownMode has been called. clip maskID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-22"clip maskdefinition
In many graphics routines, a bitmap or list of rectangles can be specified to restrict output to a particular region of the window.  The image defined by the bitmap or rectangles is called a clip mask or clipping region.  Output to child windows is automatically clipped to the borders of the parent unless subwindow_mode of the GC is IncludeInferiors.  Therefore, the borders of the parent can be thought of as a clip mask or clipping region.clipping regionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-23"clipping regiondefinition
See clip mask. coded characterID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-24"coded characterdefinition
A character bound to a codepoint. coded character setID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-25"coded character setdefinition
A set of unambiguous rules that establishes a character set and the one-to-one relationship between each character of the set and its bit representation. (ISO2022, as adapted by XPG3) A definition of a one-to-one mapping of a set of characters to a set of codepoints. Some encodings, such as Compound Text, have more than one bit representation for a given character, and thus are not considered coded character sets.codepointID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-26"codepointdefinition
The coded representation of a single character in a coded character set. colorcellID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-27"colorcellsdefinition
An entry in a colormap is known as a colorcell.  An entry contains three values specifying red, green, and blue intensities.  These values are always 16-bit unsigned numbers, with zero being minimum intensity. The values are truncated or scaled by the server to match the display hardware.  See also colormap. colormapID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-28"colormapsdefinition
A colormap consists of a set of colorcells.  A pixel value indexes into the colormap to produce intensities of red, green, and blue to be displayed.  Depending on hardware limitations, one or more colormaps may be installed at one time, such that windows associated with those maps display with true colors.  Regardless of the number of installable colormaps, any number of virtual colormaps can be created.  When needed, a virtual colormap can be installed and the existing installed colormap might have to be deinstalled.  The colormap on most systems is a limited resource that should be conserved by allocating read-only colorcells whenever possible and by selecting RGB values from the predefined color database.  Read-only cells may be shared between clients. See also colorcell, DirectColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor, StaticColor, StaticGray, and TrueColor. connectionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-29"connection with serverdefinition
The IPC path between the server and client is known as a connection.  A client usually (but not necessarily) has one connection to the server over which requests and events are sent.containmentID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-30"containmentdefinition
A window contains the pointer if the window is viewable and the hotspot of the cursor is within a visible region of the window or a visible region of one of its inferiors.  The border of the window is included as part of the window for containment.  The pointer is in a window if the window contains the pointer but no inferior contains the pointer.coordinate systemID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-31"coordinate systemdefinition
The coordinate system has X horizontal and Y vertical pixels, with the origin (0,0) at the upper left.  Coordinates are discrete. Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate system.  For a window with a border, the origin is inside the border.cursorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-32"cursordefinition
A cursor is the visible shape of the pointer on a screen.  It consists of a hotspot, a shape bitmap, a mask bitmap, and a pair of pixel values.  The cursor defined for a window controls the visible appearance of the pointer when the pointer is in that window.cut bufferID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-33"cut buffersdefinitionCut buffers are a simple but limited method of client communication, sometimes used instead of the selection mechanism.  Cut buffers are properties of the root window of screen 0 of a display.  They rely on a prior agreement between the two clients regarding the format of the data to be placed in the cut buffers.  The data that can be placed in a single cut buffer is limited to the maximum size of a single property. See selection. depthID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-34"depthdefinition
The depth of a window or pixmap is the number of planes that are to be used to represent gray scales or color within a window.descendantsID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-35"descendantsdefinition
See inferiors. deviceID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-36"devicedefinition
Keyboards, mice, tablets, track-balls, button boxes, etc. are all collectively known as input devices. DirectColorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-37"DirectColor visual classdefinitionDirectColor is a visual class in which a pixel value is decomposed into three separate subfields for colormap indexing. One subfield indexes an array to produce red intensity values; the second subfield indexes a second array to produce blue intensity values; and the third subfield indexes a third array to produce green intensity values.  The RGB (red, green, and blue) values in the colormap entry can be changed dynamically.  This visual class is normally found on high performance color workstations. (XGetVisualInfo(), XMatchVisualInfo()) displayID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-38"displaydefinition
A display is a set of one or more screens that are driven by a single X server.  The Xlib Display structure contains all ID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-39"data structuresdisplay
information about the particular display and its screens as well as the state that Xlib needs to communicate with the display over a particular connection.display functionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-40"display functionsdefinition
See logical function. drawableID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-41"drawabledefinition
Both windows and pixmaps may be used as destinations in graphics operations.  These are collectively known as drawables. encodingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-42"encodingsdefinition
A set of unambiguous rules that establishes a character set and a relationship between the characters and their bit representations. The character set does not have to be fixed to a finite pre-defined set of characters. Examples are an ISO2022 graphic set, a state-independent or state-dependent combination of graphic sets, possibly including control sets, and the X Compound Text encoding. In X, encodings are identified by a string which appears as: the
CharSetRegistry
and CharSetEncoding
components of an XLFD name; the name of a charset of the locale for which a font could not be found; or an atom which identifies the encoding of a text property or which names an encoding for a text selection target type. Encoding names should be composed of characters from the X Portable Character Set.escapementID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-43"escapementdefinition
The escapement of a string is the distance in pixels in the primary draw direction from the drawing origin to the origin of the next character (that is, the one following the given string) to be drawn.eventID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-44"eventsdefinition
Clients are informed of device input or client request side effects asynchronously via events.  Events are grouped into types; events are never sent to a client by the server unless the client has specifically asked to be informed of that type of event.  However, other clients can force events of any type to be sent to any clients. Events are typically reported relative to a window.event maskID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-45"event maskdefinition
Events are requested relative to a window.  The set of event types a client requests relative to a window is described using an
event mask.  See do_not_propagate_mask and event_mask. event propagationID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-46"event propagationdefinition
Device-related events propagate from the source window to ancestor windows until a window that has selected that type of event is reached or until the event is discarded explicitly in a do_not_propagate_mask attribute. event sourceID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-47"event sourcedefinition
The smallest window containing the pointer is the source
of a device-related event. event windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-48"event windowdefinition
An event window specifies the ID of the window in which an event appears to have occurred.  See source window. exposureID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-49"exposuredefinition
Window exposure occurs when a window is first mapped or when another window that obscures it is unmapped, resized, or moved. Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows when windows are obscured or reconfigured.  Expose events are sent to clients to inform them when contents of regions of windows have been lost and need to be regenerated.extensionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-50"extensionsdefinition
Named extensions to the core protocol can be defined to extend the system.  Extension to output requests, resources, and event types are all possible and expected.  Extensions can perform at the same level as the core Xlib.fontID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-51"fontsdefinition
The font member of a GC specifies which font to use in graphics requests.  A font is an array of characters or other bitmap shapes such as cursors.  font can be set using the GCFont mask, when the GC is created, or by a call to XSetFont().  The default font is installation dependent. font glyphID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-52"font glyphdefinition
The abstract graphical symbol for an index into a font. foregroundID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-53"foregrounddefinition
The foreground member of a GC defines the pixel value that will actually be used for drawing pictures or text.  foreground

Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer, and the server can be grabbed for exclusive use by a client, usually for a short time period.  In general, these facilities are not intended to be used by normal applications but are intended for various input and window managers to implement various styles of user interfaces.  See active grab and passive grab. graphics contextID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-59"graphics contextdefinition
Various information for graphics output is stored in a graphics context
(GC), such as foreground pixel, background pixel, line width, clipping region, etc.  Everything drawn to a window or pixmap is modified by the GC used in the drawing request.  GCs are created or altered with XChangeGC(), XCopyGC(), and XCreateGC(). gravityID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-60"gravitydefinition
Controls the repositioning of a resized window's contents (bit gravity) or of a resized parent window's subwindows (window gravity). See bit gravity and window gravity. GrayScaleID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-61"GrayScale visual classdefinitionGrayScale is a visual class in which the red, green, and blue values in any given colormap entry are equal, thus producing shades of gray.  The gray values can be changed dynamically.  GrayScale
can be viewed as a degenerate case of PseudoColor. (XGetVisualInfo(), XMatchVisualInfo()) hintID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-62"hintsdefinition
Certain properties, such as the preferred size of a window, are referred to as hints, since the window manager makes no guarantee that it will honor them.  See XA_WM_HINTS, XA_WM_NORMAL_HINTS, XA_WM_SIZE_HINTS, and XA_WM_ZOOM_HINTS. host access listID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-63"host access listdefinition
See access control list. host portable character encodingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-64"Host Portable Character Encodingdefinition
The encoding of the X Portable Character Set on the host. The encoding itself is not defined by this standard, but the encoding must be the same in all locales supported by Xlib on the host. If a string is said to be in the Host Portable Character Encoding, then it only contains characters from the X Portable Character Set, in the host encoding.hotspotID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-65"hotspotdefinition
A cursor has an associated hotspot that defines the point in the cursor which corresponds to the coordinates reported for the pointer.iconID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-66"iconsdefinition

Each resource has an identifier or ID, a unique value that clients use to name the resource.  Any client can use a resource if it knows the resource ID.inferiorsID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-68"inferiorsdefinition
The inferiors of a window are all of the subwindows nested below it:  the children, the children's children, etc.  The term descendants
is a synonym. input focusID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-69"input focusdefinition
See keyboard focus. input managerID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-70"input managerdefinition
Control over keyboard input may be provided by an input manager
client.  This job may also be done by the window manager. InputOnly windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-71"InputOnly windowdefinition
A window that cannot be used for graphics requests is called an InputOnly window.  InputOnly windows are invisible and can be used to control such things as cursors, input event generation, and grabbing.  InputOnly windows cannot have InputOutput
windows as inferiors. InputOutput windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-72"InputOutput windowdefinition
The normal kind of window that is used for both input and output is called an InputOutput window.  It usually has a background. InputOutput windows can have both InputOutput
and InputOnly windows as inferiors. internationalizationID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-73"internationalizationdefinition

The international environment of a computer program defining the "localized"behavior of that program at run-time. This information can be established from one or more sets of localization data. ANSI C defines locale-specific processing by C system library calls. See ANSI C and the X/Open Portability Guide specifications for more details. In this specification, on implementations that conform to the ANSI C library, the "current locale" is the current setting of the LC_CTYPE setlocale
category. Associated with each locale is a text encoding.  When text is processed in the context of a locale, the text must be in the encoding of the locale. The current locale affects Xlib in its encoding and processing of input method text, encoding of resource files and values, encoding and imaging of text strings, and encoding and decoding for interclient text communication.localizationID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-78"localizationdefinition
The process of establishing information within a computer system specific to the operation of particular native languages, local customs and coded character sets. (XPG3)locale nameID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-79"locale namedefinition
The identifier used to select the desired locale for the host C library and X library functions. On ANSI C library compliant systems, the locale argument to the
setlocale
function. key grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-80"key grabdefinition
Specifies a keyboard grab that occurs only when a certain key or key combination is pressed.  This is analogous to a button grab. See keyboard grab. keyboard focusID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-81"keyboard focusdefinition
The keyboard focus is the window that receives main keyboard input.  By default, the focus is the root window, which has the effect of sending input to the window that is being pointed to by the mouse. It is possible to attach the keyboard input to a specific window with XSetInputFocus().  Events are then sent to the window independent of the pointer position or, if the owner_events
argument is True, to the window containing the pointer if it is owned by the same client as the focus window.keyboard grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-82"keyboard grabdefinition
All keyboard input is sent to a specific window (or client, depending on owner_events) when the keyboard is grabbed.  This is analogous to a mouse grab.  This is very much like a temporary keyboard focus window.keyboard vectorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-83"keyboard vectordefinition
A keyboard vector represents, in the event structure, the state of the keyboard; the vector consists of 32 bytes of data, with one bit for each keyboard key.keycodeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-84"keycodedefinition
A keycode is a code in the range [8,255], inclusive, that represents a physical or logical key on the keyboard.  The mapping between keys and keycodes cannot be changed.  A list of keysyms is associated with each keycode.keysymID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-85"keysymsdefinition
A keysym is a #defined symbol which is a portable representation of the symbol on the cap of a key.  Each key may have several keysyms, corresponding to the key when various modifier keys are pressed.  You should interpret key events according to the keysym returned by XLookupString() or XLookupKeysym(), since this translates server-dependent keycodes into portable keysyms. See keycode. listenerID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-86"listener window managerdefinitionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-87"listener window managerID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-88"window managerlistener
A listener-style window manager sets the keyboard focus to a particular window when that window is clicked on with a pointer button. This is the window manager style used with the Apple Macintosh‘. logical functionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-89"logical functionsdefinitionLogical functions control how the source pixel values generated by a graphics request are combined with the old destination pixel values already present on the screen or drawable to result in the final destination pixel values.  A logical function can be changed by a call to XSetFunction().  Sometimes called raster operations, raster ops, or display functions.mappingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-90"mappingdefinition
A window is said to be mapped if a XMapWindow() or XMapRaised() call has been performed on it.  Unmapped windows are never viewable.  Mapping makes a window eligible for display.  The window will actually be displayed if the following conditions are met:  (1) all its ancestors are mapped and (2) it is not obscured by siblings.maskID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-91"masksdefinition
A mask specifies which values in a specified structure should be read when updating the resource values.  One bit in the mask is assigned to every member of its corresponding structure.  For example,
CWBackgroundPixmap mask is used to indicate that the background_pixmap member of the specified window attributes structure is to be read and the corresponding member in the resource changed.  See structure. modifier keyID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-92"modifier keysdefinition
A key such as Shift or Control that can modify the meaning of a key event.  Shift, Control, Meta, Super, Hyper, Alt, Compose, Apple, Caps Lock, Shift Lock, and similar keys are called modifier keys. monochromeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-93"monochrome displaydefinition
A monochrome screen has only two colors:  black and white. Monochrome is a special case of the StaticGray visual class, in which there!!! are only two colormap entries.mouse grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-94"mouse grabdefinition
All mouse input is sent to a specific window (or client, depending on owner_events) when the mouse is grabbed.  This is analogous to a keyboard grab.multibyteID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-95"multi-bytedefinition
A character whose codepoint is stored in more than one byte; any encoding which can contain multibyte characters; text in a multibyte encoding. The "char *" null-terminated string datatype in ANSI C. Note that references in this document to multibyte strings imply only that the strings may contain multibyte characters. obscuresID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-96"obscuresdefinition
Window Aobscures window B if A is higher in the global stacking order and the rectangle defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B. occludesID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-97"occludesdefinition
Window Aoccludes window B if both are mapped, if A
is higher in the global stacking order, and if the rectangle defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B.  The (fine) distinction between the terms obscures
and occludes is that for obscures, the windows have to be mapped, while for occludes, they do not.  Also note that window borders are included in the calculation.  Note that InputOnly windows never obscure other windows but can occlude other windows.owner clientID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-98"owner clientdefinition
Selections transfer arbitrary information between two clients. An owner client owns the data representing the value of a selection, and a requestor client wants it.  See selection. paddingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-99"paddingdefinition
Some bytes are inserted in the data stream to maintain alignment of the protocol requests on natural boundaries.  This padding
increases ease of portability to some machine architectures. parent windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-100"parent windowdefinition
Each new window is created with reference to another previously created window.  The new window is referred to as the child, and the reference window as the parent.  If C is a child of P, then P is the parent of C.  Only the portion of the child that overlaps the parent is viewable.passive grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-101"passive grabdefinition
Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer, and the server can be grabbed for exclusive use by a client, usually for a short time period.  A passive grab causes an active grab to begin when a certain key or button combination is pressed.  The grab becomes active when the key or button is actually pressed.  Before the active grab takes place, nothing has changed.  See active grab. pixel valueID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-102"pixel valuedefinition
A pixel value is an N-bit value, where N is the number of bit planes used in a particular window or pixmap.  For a window, a pixel value indexes a colormap to derive an actual color to be displayed.  For a pixmap, a pixel value will be interpreted as a color in the same way when it is copied into a  window.pixmapID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-103"pixmapsdefinition
A pixmap is a three-dimensional array of bits.  A pixmap is normally thought of as a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel can be a value from 0 to (2N-1), where N is the depth (z-axis) of the pixmap.  A pixmap can also be thought of as a stack of
N bitmaps. planeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-104"planesdefinition
When a pixmap or a window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps, each bitmap is called a plane. ID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-105"plane bit planeplane_maskID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-106"plane_mask GC componentdefinition
Graphics operations can be restricted to affect only a subset of bit planes in a drawable.  The plane_mask member of a GC is a bit mask describing which planes are to be modified.  Default is all ones.
plane_mask can be set using the GCPlaneMask mask, when the GC is created, or it can be changed by a call to XSetPlaneMask(). pointerID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-107"pointersdefinition
The pointer is the pointing device currently attached to the cursor and tracked on the screens.  This may be a mouse, tablet, track-ball, or joystick, among other things.pointer grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-108"pointer grabdefinition
A client can actively grab control of the pointer, causing button and motion events to be sent to the grabbing client rather than to the client indicated by the pointer.pointing deviceID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-109"pointing devicedefinition
A pointing device is typically a mouse or tablet or some other device with effective two-dimensional motion.  There is only one visible cursor defined by the core protocol, and it tracks whatever pointing device is currently attached as the pointer.positionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-110"positiondefinition
A window has a position, which locates its upper-left corner relative to its parent's corner.POSIXID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-111"POSIXdefinition
Portable Operating System Interface, ISO/IEC 9945-1 (IEEE Std 1003.1). POSIX Portable Filename Character SetID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-112"POSIX Portable Filename Character Setdefinition

ISO2022 defines control characters and escape sequences which temporarily (single shift) or permanently (locking shift) cause a different character set to be in effect ("invoking" a character set). propertyID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-114"propertiesdefinition
Windows may have associated properties, each consisting of a name, a type, a data format, and some data.  The protocol places no interpretation on properties; they are intended as a general purpose data storage and intercommunication mechanism for clients.  There is, however, a list of predefined properties and property types so that clients might share information such as resize hints, program names, and icon formats with a window manager via properties.  In order to avoid passing arbitrary length property name strings, each property name is associated with a corresponding integer value known as an atom.  See also atom. property listID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-115"property listdefinition
The property list of a window is the list of properties that have been defined for that window.PseudoColorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-116"PseudoColor visual classdefinitionPseudoColor is a visual class in which a pixel value indexes the colormap entry to produce independent red, green, and blue values.  That is, the colormap is viewed as an array of triples (RGB values).  The RGB values can be changed dynamically. (XGetVisualInfo(), XMatchVisualInfo()) quarkID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-117"quarksdefinition
A quark is an integer ID that identifies a name, class, or type string for the resource manager.  Like atoms and resource IDs, quarks eliminate the need to pass strings of arbitrary length over the network. The quark type is XrmQuark, and the types XrmName, XrmClass, and XrmRepresentation are also defined to be XrmQuark. raiseID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-118"raisedefinition
Changing the stacking order of a window so as to occlude all sibling windows is to raise that window. raster operationID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-119"raster operationsdefinition

A window management style characterized by the input being sent to whichever window the pointer is in.  This is the most common style of input management used in X.rectangleID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-121"rectanglesdefinition
A rectangle specified by [x,y,w,h] has an (infinitely thin) outline path with corners at [x,y], [x+w,y], [x+w,y+h] and [x,y+h].  When a rectangle is filled, the lower-right edges are not drawn.  For example, if w=h=0, nothing would be drawn.  For w=h=1, a single pixel would be drawn. redirectID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-122"redirectiondefinition
Window managers (or other clients) may wish to enforce window layout policy in various ways.  When a client attempts to change the size or position of a window, the operation may be redirected to the window manager, rather than actually being performed.  Then the window manager (or other client that redirected the input) is expected to decide whether to allow, modify, or deny the requested operation before making the call itself.reparentingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-123"reparentingdefinition
The window manager often reparents the top-level windows of each application in order to add a titlebar and perhaps resize boxes.  In other words, a window with a titlebar is inserted between the root window and each top-level window.  See also save-set. replyID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-124"replydefinition
Information requested by a client, by routines whose names include the word Query, is sent back to the client with a reply. Both events and replies are multiplexed on the same connection. Requests that require replies are known as round-trip requests. Most requests do not generate replies.  Some requests generate multiple replies.  See round-trip request. requestID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-125"requestsdefinition
A command to the server is called a request.  It is a single block of data sent over the connection to the server.requestor clientID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-126"requestor clientdefinition
Selections transfer arbitrary information between two clients.  An owner client owns the data representing the value of a selection, and a requestor client wants it.  See selection. resourceID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-127"resourcesdefinition
Windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, graphics contexts, and colormaps are known as resources.  They all have unique identifiers (IDs) associated with them for naming purposes.  The lifetime of a resource is bounded by the lifetime of the connection over which the resource was created.resource managerID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-128"resource managerdefinition
Every application should provide command line options that allow users to set colors or patterns for the window border and background; set foreground colors for drawing; start the application at a desired size, position, and configuration; select fonts; and so on.  An application must also allow users to specify their own default values (user preferences) for each of these options.  There are three and sometimes four sets of options that need to be read and merged:  the program's defaults, the user's defaults stored in the root window's
XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property or in the user's .Xdefaults
file, and the command line arguments.  The order in which the various options are merged is important.  A value for an option in the user's defaults should override the program's default for that option, but a value on the command line would override both the program's and the user's default value.  The routines and database structures used for managing user preferences are collectively referred to as the
resource manager. RGB valuesID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-129"RGBvalues
Red, green, and blue intensity values are used to define a color. These values are always represented as 16-bit unsigned numbers, with 0 the minimum intensity and 65535 the maximum intensity. The X server scales these values to match the display hardware.rootID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-130"root windowdefinition
The root of a window, pixmap, or graphics context (GC) is the same as the root of whatever drawable was used when the window, pixmap, or GC was created.  These resources can be used only on the screen indicated by this window.  See root window. root windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-131"root windowdefinition
Each screen has a root window covering it.  It cannot be reconfigured or unmapped but otherwise acts as a full-fledged window.  A root window has no parent.round-trip requestID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-132"round-trip requestdefinition
A request to the server that generates a reply is known as a round-trip request.  Requests that require replies should be avoided when possible since they introduce network delays.  See reply. save-setID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-133"save-setdefinition
The save-set of a client is a list of other clients' windows which, if they are inferiors of one of the client's windows at connection close, should not be destroyed and which should be reparented and remapped if the client is unmapped.  Save-sets are typically used by window managers to avoid lost windows if the manager should terminate abnormally.  See reparenting for more background information. scan lineID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-134"scan linedefinition
A scan line is a list of pixel or bit values viewed as a horizontal row (all values having the same Y coordinate) of an image, with the values ordered by increasing X coordinate values.scan line orderID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-135"scan line orderdefinition
An image represented in scan line order contains scan lines ordered by increasing Y coordinate values.screenID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-136"screensdefinition
A server may provide several independent screens, which may or may not have physically independent monitors.  For instance, it is possible to treat a color monitor as if it were two screens, one color and the other black and white.  There is only a single keyboard and pointer shared among the screens.  A Screen structure ID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-137"data structuresstructures
contains the information about that screen and is a member of the Display structure. ID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-138"data structuresdisplayselectionID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-139"selectionsdefinitionSelections are a means of communication between clients using properties and events.  From the user's perspective, a selection is an item of data which can be highlighted in one instance of an application and pasted into another instance of the same or a different application. The client that highlights the data is the owner, and the client into which the data is pasted is the requestor.  Properties are used to store the selection data and the type of the data, while events are used to synchronize the transaction and to allow the requestor to indicate the type it prefers for the data and to allow the owner to convert the data to the indicated type if possible.  See cut buffer. serverID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-140"serversdefinition
The server provides the basic windowing mechanism.  It handles IPC connections from clients, demultiplexes graphics requests onto the screens, and multiplexes input back to the appropriate clients.  It controls a single keyboard and pointer and one or more screens that make up a single display.server grabID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-141"server grabbingdefinition
The server can be grabbed by a single client for exclusive use. This prevents processing of any requests from other client connections until the grab is complete.  This is typically a transient state to perform such tasks as rubber-banding and pop-up menus or to execute requests indivisibly.siblingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-142"siblingdefinition
Children of the same parent window are known as sibling windows. source windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-143"source windowdefinition
A source window specifies the ID of the window in which an event originally happens.  See event window. stacking orderID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-144"stacking orderdefinition
Sibling windows may stack on top of each other, obscuring lower windows. This is similar to papers on a desk.  The relationship between sibling windows is known as the stacking order.  The first window in the stacking order is the window on top.state-dependent encodingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-145"state-dependent encodingsdefinition
An encoding in which an invocation of a charset can apply to multiple characters in sequence. A state-dependent encoding begins in an "initial state"and enters other "shift states" when specific "shift sequences"are encountered in the byte sequence. In ISO2022 terms, this means use of locking shifts, not single shifts.state-independent encodingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-146"state-independent encodingsdefinition
Any encoding in which the invocations of the charsets are fixed, or span only a single character. In ISO2022 terms, this means use of at most single shifts, not locking shifts.STRING encodingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-147"STRING encodingdefinition
Latin-1, plus tab and newline. StaticColorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-148"StaticColor visual classdefinitionStaticColor is a visual class which represents a multiplane color screen with a predefined and read-only hardware colormap. It can be viewed as a degenerate case of PseudoColor. (XGetVisualInfo(), XMatchVisualInfo()) StaticGrayID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-149"StaticGray visual classdefinitionStaticGray is a visual class which represents a multiplane monochrome screen with a predefined and read-only hardware colormap. It can be viewed as a degenerate case of GrayScale, in which the gray values are predefined and read-only.  Typically, the values are linearly increasing ramps. (XGetVisualInfo(), XMatchVisualInfo()) StatusID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-150"statusdefinition
Many Xlib functions return a Status of zero if it fails and nonzero if it succeeds.  If the function does not succeed, its arguments are not changed.stippleID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-151"stippledefinition
The stipple member of a GC defines a single-plane pixmap that is used to tile a region.  Bits set to 1 in the stipple are drawn with the foreground pixel value; bits set to 0, with the background pixel value.  stipple can be set using the GCStipple mask, when the GC is created, or by a call to XSetStipple().  Default is the pixmap filled with ones. See tile. STRING encodingID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-152"STRING encodingdefinition
Latin-1, plus tab and newline. structureID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-153"structuresdefinition
Pointers to structures are the major way of specifying data to and returning data from Xlib routines.  If the routine returns data, the returned value will be a pointer to the data structure, unless the routine returns more then one structure, in which case one or all of the structures will be arguments.  When setting the characteristics of an X resource, such as a set of window attributes or a graphics context, both a structure and a mask are specified as arguments.  See mask. subwindow_modeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-154"subwindow_modeGC component
The subwindow_mode member of a GC controls whether subwindows obscure their parent.  subwindow_mode can be set using the GCSubwindowMode mask, when the GC is created, or by a call to XSetSubwindowMode().  Possible values are ClipByChildren
(the default) or IncludeInferiors. tileID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-155"tilesdefinition
The tile member of a GC defines a pixmap used for patterning an area.  A tile has the same depth as the drawable it is used to pattern.
tile can be set using the GCTile mask, when the GC is created, or by a call to XSetTile().  Default is the pixmap is filled with the foreground pixel.  See stipple. timeID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-156"timedefinition
A time value in X is expressed in milliseconds, typically since the last server reset.  Time values wrap around (after about 49.7 days). One time value, represented by the constant CurrentTime, is used by clients to represent the current server time.top-level windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-157"top-level windowsdefinition
A child of the root window is referred to as a top-level window. TrueColorID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-158"TrueColor visual classdefinitionTrueColor is a visual class which represents a high performance multiplane display with predefined and read-only RGB values in its hardware colormap.  It can be viewed as a degenerate case of DirectColor, in which the subfields in the pixel value directly encode the corresponding RGB values.  Typically, the values are linearly increasing ramps. (XGetVisualInfo(), XMatchVisualInfo()) type propertyID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-159"type propertydefinition
A type property is used to identify the interpretation of property data.  Types are completely uninterpreted by the server; they are solely for the benefit of clients.viewableID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-160"viewabledefinition
A window is viewable if it and all of its ancestors are mapped. This does not imply that any portion of the window is actually visible, since it may be obscured by other windows.visibleID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-161"visibledefinition
A region of a window is visible if someone looking at the screen can actually see it; that is, the window is viewable and the region is not obscured by any other window.visualID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-162"visualsdefinition
The specifications for color handling for a drawable, including visual class, depth, RGB/pixel, etc., are collectively referred to as a
visual and are stored in a structure of type Visual. The visual accounts for the differences between various types of hardware in determining the way pixel values are translated into visible colors within a window.  A screen may support only one of several types of visuals.visual classID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-163"visual classdefinition
This attribute accounts for the differences between various types of display hardware in determining the way in which pixel values are translated into visible colors within a particular window. See DirectColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor, StaticColor, StaticGray, and TrueColor. whitespaceID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-164"whitespacedefinition
Any spacing character. On implementations that conform to the ANSI C library, whitespace is any character for which
isspace
returns True. windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-165"windowdefinition
An X server controls a bitmapped screen.  In order to make it easier to view and control many different tasks at the same time, this screen can be divided up into smaller areas called windows.  A window is a rectangular area of any size that works in several ways like a miniature screen. Windows in the screen can be arranged so they all are visible or so they cover each other completely or partially.  Each window can be involved in a different activity, and the windows currently in use are placed so they are at least partially visible.window gravityID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-166"window gravitydefinition
When windows are resized, subwindows may be repositioned automatically relative to an edge, a corner, or the center of the window.  This attraction of a subwindow to some part of its parent is known as window gravity. window managerID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-167"window managerdefinition
Manipulation of windows on the screen is provided by a window manager client.  The window manager has authority over the arrangement of windows on the screen and the user interface for selecting which window receives input.  See also redirect. X Portable Character SetID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-168"X Portable Character Setdefinition
A basic set of 97 characters which are assumed to exist in all locales supported by Xlib.  This set contains the following characters:    a..z A..Z 0..9   !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~   <space>, <tab>, and <newline>
This is the left/lower half (also called the G0 set) of the graphic character set of ISO8859-1 plus <space>, <tab>, and <newline>. It is also the set of graphic characters in 7-bit ASCII plus the same three control characters. The actual encoding of these characters on the host is system dependent; see the Host Portable Character Encoding.XLFDID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-169"XLFDdefinition
The X Logical Font Description Conventions that define a standard syntax for structured font names.XYPixmapID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-170"XYPixmap format imagedefinitionXYPixmap specifies the format for an image.  The data for an image is said to be in XYPixmap format if it is organized as a set of bitmaps representing individual bit planes. (XCreateImage(), XGetImage(), XPutImage()) zoomed windowID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-171"zoomed windowdefinition
Some applications not only have a normal size for their top-level window and an icon but also have a zoomed window size.  This could be used in a painting program (similar to the MacPaint‘ fat bits).  The zoomed window size preferences can be specified in the window manager hints.ZPixmapID="IX-1002-GLOSSARY-172"ZPixmap format imagedefinitionZPixmap specifies the format for an image.  The data for an image is said to be in ZPixmap format if it is organized as a set of pixel values in scan line order.
