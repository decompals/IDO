readltc: longitudinal timecode parser
-------------------------------------

LTC (longitudinal time code) is a scheme for encoding SMPTE time code 
information in an audio signal. LTC is the format used to stripe 
SMPTE timecode onto an audio tape or onto a longitudinal audio track on 
a video tape. 

"readltc" reads and decodes a sampled LTC signal stored in 
a 16-bit mono AIFF-C input file.  To run the example, type 
"readltc smpte.aifc". The program will display approximately 30 sec of time 
code information encoded in the sample file "smpte.aifc" (16-bit mono 
22050 kHz AIFF-C file).

"readltc" doesn't require audio hardware. It would be a straightforward 
exercise to modify this program so that it uses the Audio Library 
to read a live audio input signal.

These timecode fields are displayed in the output from "readltc":

	forward/reverse:
		indicates direction of tape movement

	hours : minutes : seconds : frames

	ug:	user group bits 

                There are 8 user groups in an LTC time-
                code, each 4 bits long. User group bits are displayed
                in the order ug0 ... ug7.

	df:	drop flag bit value

	cf:	color lock flag bit value

	ua:    	unassigned bits from positions 27, 43, 58, 59 in the
                80-bit LTC timecode word
