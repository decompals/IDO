This directory contains a sample MIDI file player, written in 
Viewkit.  It requires C++, Viewkit and Motif development systems
to compile and use.

Before using it, copy the resource file Mfp to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.

This program is intended as an example of how to use the MIDI library,
and some of its more subtle quirks.
