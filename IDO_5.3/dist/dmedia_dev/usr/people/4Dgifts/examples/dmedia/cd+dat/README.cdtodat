CDTODAT: A simple CD-to-DAT copying example

cdtodat serves as a simple example of how to record to an audio DAT. 
It takes an entire CD and digitally transfers the data to DAT, providing
correct program numbers, index numbers, program-time, absolute-time,
copy-protect bits, and lead-in and lead-out areas on the tape. cdtodat 
should produce tapes that conform to the DAT specification.

cdtodat does not provide any user-interface. It has two modes: quiet
and verbose. In quiet mode, the program will perform the entire copy
without printing anything except errors. In quiet mode, which is 
invoked with the '-q' option, the program will not indicate which program
and index it is currently copying.

If cdtodat has problems on your machine, you may want to clean the
heads on the DAT drive using a head-cleaner DAT. The DAT drives are 
notoriously sensitive to dirty heads.

Please don't use cdtodat to reproduce copyrighted material except where 
permitted by law.

Requirements:

cdtodat requires a CDROM drive capable of reading audio over the SCSI
bus. The Toshiba models shipped by SGI have this capability. It also
requires an audio-capable DAT drive which is compatible with the 
ARDAT Python. The standard DAT drives from SGI provide this. Further,
cdtodat must be run as root, because access to the CD drive requires
root privileges. The media to be recorded to/from must be present in both
drives before the program is executed.

cdtodat is provided as-is and without warranty -- please see the notice in the
source code.

I welcome any feedback about cdtodat, as well as enhancements that you
may make.
