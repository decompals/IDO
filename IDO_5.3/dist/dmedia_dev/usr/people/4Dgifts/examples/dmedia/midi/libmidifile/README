This directory contains a simple and not terribly complete MIDI file
library as an example for the MIDI library.  The program "playfile.c++"
in examples/dmedia/midi/player uses this library, and is known to work 
within its limits.  Any bug reports may or may not get fixed, but submissions
will often be welcome.
