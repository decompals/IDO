README for soundfile programming examples

These programs use the Audio File Library.  The 
programs do not record or play back audio, and 
will run on any IRIS system.

aifcinfo:    
--------

Parses an AIFF or AIFF-C file and prints out a 
detailed description of the audio data and header
information inside the file.

aiff2aifc, aifc2aiff, aifccompress, aifcdecompress:
---------------------------------------------------

These sample programs are all generated from the same
source file:   aifcconvert.c

aiff2aifc: 
    Converts an AIFF file to the newer AIFF-C standard
    format. Preserves all header and auxiliary information
    (strings, MIDI exclusive data, etc) during the conversion.

aifc2aiff:
    Converts an AIFF-C file to the older AIFF format.
    Preserves all header and auxiliary data chunks (strings,
    MIDI exclusive data, etc) common to both formats.

    Provides backward compatability for applications which
    do not support the newer AIFF-C format. Applications 
    linked with the SGI Audio File Library can automatically
    parse files in either format. 

aifccompress:
    Converts an AIFF-C file which contains uncompressed audio data to
    an AIFF-C file which contains compressed data. Nonaudio and 
    auxiliary header information is preserved.

    Compression algorithms supported by the SGI Audio File Library are:
    CCITT G.722 ADPCM, CCITT G.711 mu-law, CCITT G.722 A-law, and
    Aware MPEG and MultiRate algorithms.
    The SGI Audio File Library does not support Apple proprietary
    compression schemes. 

aifcdecompress:
    Converts an AIFF-C file which contains compressed audio data to
    an AIFF-C file which contains uncompressed data. Nonaudio and
    auxiliary header information is preserved.
