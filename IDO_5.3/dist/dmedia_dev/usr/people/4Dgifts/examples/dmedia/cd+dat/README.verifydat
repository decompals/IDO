VERIFYDAT: A simple DAT checking program

verifydat will read an entire DAT tape, from lead-in to lead-out areas,
and verify the timecode contents of the DAT. In particular, it tests
for discontinuities in a-time or p-time, and verifies that the p-time
is correctly recorded according to the DAT spec. This is useful
for checking the output of cdtodat and dodat; for some 
commands (writes following reads, writes following seeks) older DAT 
firmware is not frame-accurate.

With the -t option, verifydat will also test the audio data on the
DAT, assuming that it has been written with the 'testpat' command
under 'dodat'. This will verify that the audio data on the tape is
perfect.
