              Explanation of the contents of ~4Dgifts/examples 
              ------------------------------------------------


     This subtree is populated with various GL implementations as well as
     some X, fontmanager, network, UNIX and video examples.


     "Fortran" contains GL programs and an implementation of shared memory
     all written in Fortran.

     "X11" contains clients, widgets, and toolkits subtrees.  The clients
     subtree provides basic "pure" X programming examples (including only
     Xlib/Xt libraries), as well as some X-GL "combo" programs.

     "devices" contains Dial and Buttons, digitizer (tablet) C code, a
     printer test program, as well as a subdir of generic SCSI driver 
     programs, and a subdir containing sample source for StereoView;

     "fontmanager" illustrates some basic examples of how to use the 
     IRIS Font Library.  For more info on this, refer to Chapter 4, 
     "Using the IRIS Font Library" in the "Graphics Library Windowing
     and Font Library Programming Guide".

     "glpg" contains all on-line versions of all the source code examples
     contained in the "Graphics Library Programming Guide", Version 2.0.
     They are ordered by chapter number in subdirectories under glpg. 

     "grafix" contains modified, on-line examples from the old IRIS USER's 
     GUIDE, Volume 1, plus some extra programs including:  creating an 
     object file in the spin format;  implementing multiple cursors;  use 
     of the overlay bitplanes;  another picking example;  a single-line 
     textport;  a program which illustrates a technique for rotating an 
     object about a fixed set of axes,  as well as how backface removal 
     can be computed in software;  and 3 zbuffer programs both in RGB as 
     well as color-map mode.

     "hllapi"--there used to be a directory by this name which contained
     example source for people involved in ibm-link procedures.  Now it
     lives on the 3270  software option tape and the on-line examples are
     loaded into two directories:  /usr/3270/example/{CASE1, CASE2}.

     "intl" contains examples of internationalization, particularly how
     to support code sets other than ASCII.

     "light" contains on-line versions of the four examples from chapter 9
     on Lighting in the "Graphics Library Programming Guide" (GLPG),  
     Version 1.0, & 1.1.  NOTE:  These examples are no longer included in 
     the GLPG, Version 2.0.

     "nurbs" has C, Fortran, and Pascal examples illustrating 
     implementation of the new addition of Silicon Graphics' GL interface 
     for the display of trimmed Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) 
     surfaces.

     "network" has some sample network programs using Internet (TCP/UDP) 
     and UNIX domain sockets, as discussed in Chapter 3 of the Network 
     Communications Guide.  This directory was "tcp" in previous releases.

     "pl1" demonstrates GL programing examples rewritten in the pl1
     language.

     "skywriter" includes an example demonstrating the newest addition to 
     the 4D family line of IRIS machines.

     "trackball" provides a virtual trackball implementation in C with 
     event-queue handling, and user-interface routines.

     "unix" contains UNIX system programming code in C including programs 
     that spawn children, communicate between two different processes via 
     IPC, pipes, signal handling and shared memory.   Also included are 
     IRIX specific programs either exclusively mips-based or contain SGI
     dependent system calls;

     "vgx" contains 5 sudirectories of various new programs demonstrating 
     the new GL routines available only on machines with VGX capability. 
     SkyWriter machines have the full feature set as well. Indigo machines
     have most of the VGX feature set available.  These include texture 
     mapping, motion blurring, arbitrary clip planes, new light features, 
     and a program using the stencil planes.

     "video" provides an initial set of demonstration programs for setting
     up/moving among the various video modes.
