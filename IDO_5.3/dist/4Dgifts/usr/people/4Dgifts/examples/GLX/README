            Explanation of the contents of ~4Dgifts/examples/GLX
            ----------------------------------------------------


     This subtree is populated with various GL-X mixed model examples
     for your edification, and to provide the kind of example templates
     for which there is no better substitute when it comes to learning
     about a new way of programming something.



     "glxwdiget" contains an implementation of the GlxDraw and GlxMDraw
     widget for drawing GL inside of an Xt based program is the "widget"
     subdir.  GlxDraw is widget set independent, while GlxMDraw is 
     specifically set up for Motif users.  There is also a "demos" 
     subdir which contains various demos showing off implementations of
     mixed model programming using the GlxDraw and GlxMDraw widgets.  
     Some of the programs are revisited versions of GL C graphics 
     examples taken from ~4Dgifts/examples/grafix.  Others are new.



     "gl-Xlib" contains mixed model programs which combine SGI's GL with
     Xlib, the lowest layer of X functionality for creating and 
     manipulating windows.  In each of the programs included here, the 
     "magic" happening is that an X window is created and then GL drawing
     is enabled to be directed into this X-created window.  WINOPEN(3G)
     is never called.  Thus programmers are now enabled full access to
     the features provided by the native window system.
