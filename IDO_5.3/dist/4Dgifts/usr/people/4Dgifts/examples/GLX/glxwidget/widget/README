     Explanation of the contents of ~4Dgifts/examples/GLX/glxwidget/widget
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     This directory contains the GlxDraw and GlxMDraw widget for drawing GL
     inside of an Xt based program.  GlxDraw is widget set independent,
     while GlxMDraw is specifically set up for Motif users.  Both
     widgets are based on the same source file (GlxDraw.c) and the
     differences are controlled by #ifdef __GLX_MOTIF.
     
     The purpose of this directory is for users interested in
     examining the source of these widgets, or who wish to modify
     their behavior.  However, users should normally link against the
     version of this widget included in the Xirisw library.

     These files are for informational purposes and can demonstrate how
     to write your own mixed-mode GL-based widgets.  However SGI does not
     guarantee that this source code absolutely matches the GLxDraw
     widget that is shipped as part of the system.
