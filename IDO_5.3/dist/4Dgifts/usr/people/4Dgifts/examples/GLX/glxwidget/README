        Explanation of the contents of ~4Dgifts/examples/GLX/glxwidget
        --------------------------------------------------------------

     The widget directory contains the GlxDraw and GlxMDraw widget for 
     drawing GL inside of an Xt based program.  GlxDraw is widget set 
     independent, while GlxMDraw is specifically set up for Motif 
     users.
     
     The subtree directory structure is as follows:
     
     	widget contains the widget code itself.
     
     	demos contains various demos.
     
     Although the widget directory contains the source to the widget,
     it is not necessary to build it in order to build the demos, as
     they link directly against the Xirisw library.  The widget code
     is provided only for reference.
     
     The README file in the demos directory describes what the various 
     programs included here demonstrate.  The original programs in 
     ~4Dgifts/examples/grafix/{scrn_rotate, zrgb, zcmapmenu, zrgbmenu}
     were used to show the difference as to how they would look if there
     implemented athena widgets (azrgbinput.c), or motif widgets (mscrn*, 
     mzcmapmenu.c, mzrgb*).  The others are new.
 
     Be sure to study the README.TransG-chp5, an on-line, "ascii-
     viewable" copy of chapter 5 of the "IRIX 4D1-4.0 Transition Guide, 
     Programming Environment".  It was felt a copy of this chapter 
     focusing on GL rendering applications implementing GL Widgets was 
     important to include here to achieve the widest possible 
     accessibility by programmers.
