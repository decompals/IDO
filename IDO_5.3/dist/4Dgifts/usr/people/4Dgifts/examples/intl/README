   README for ~4Dgifts/examples/intl source code programming examples in C 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------


       These files provide an example of displaying non-English language
   text using the new GL commands deflfont, lcharstr and lstrwidth.
   They are installed as part of the full gifts package.  

       The files consist of:

		jisraster.c  jistools.c   pcftogl.c	hpcf.h


  -->  jisraster.c       A program adapted from
			 4Dgifts/examples/glpg/ch03/rasterchars2.c,
			 except this one displays labels in Japanese
			 Kanji characters.

  -->  jistools.c        A tool for displaying a string encoded in
			 Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) encoding.
			 This is not a separate executable, only a
			 support module for jisraster.c.

  -->  pcftogl.c         A tool for loading a .pcf file into
			 structures which the GL can understand.
			 This is not a separate executable, only a
			 support module for jisraster.c.

  -->  hpcf.h		 Public interface and documentation
			 for utilities in pcftogl.c.


       In order to compile and run the 'jisraster' program, you must 
   have the X development system (gl_x_dev.sw) installed as well as the 
   X Asian fonts option (eoe2.sw.Xasianfonts), and the basic X fonts 
   (eoe2.sw.Xfonts).

       If the only file in this directory is the 'README' file, and you 
   wish to see this demo, you must install dev.sw.giftsfull.
