	"hollowcube-vgx" demonstrates an implementation of the section
	of the article "The Hidden Charms of the Z-Buffer", from the
	"IRIS Universe", Issue Number Eleven, that discusses "Outlined
	Polygons and Hidden Lines."  This program uses hollow polygons
	to draw an outlined cube.  Pressing MIDDLEMOUSE removes the 
	hidden lines (by filling the cube's faces with background color).


	"cap" is a very swank program written by Mr. GL himself, Kurt 
	Akeley.   This is an experiment with capping alogrithms the 
	results of which are marvelously illustrated by enabling any one
	of the 6 arbitrary clipping planes (via the RIGHTMOUSE menu item)
	and then enabling and disabling the capping menu selection to
	view the difference.  The menu items (using RIGHTMOUSE) are
	farily self-explanatory.  Where indicated, the character in 
	parenthesis following a given item will produce the same results
	when pressed as explicitly selecting that menu item will do.

	NOTE:  this program also understands the demo model files in
   	       /usr/demos/data/models, however the only one that is built 
	       of proper polygonal surfaces--such surfaces separate space
	       into inside and outside volumes--is martini.bin.  
	       Regretably, the others are sadly lacking.  To see the 
	       martini, execute 

        	< 102 ratmandu /vgx/stencil> cap martini.bin
