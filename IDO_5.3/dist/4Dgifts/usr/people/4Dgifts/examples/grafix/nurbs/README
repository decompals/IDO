    nurbs, fnurbs, pnurbs: 

      This directory contains 3 different language versions of a simple 
    program that uses Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces:  in
    C, (nurbs.c -> nurbs), in Fortran (nurbs.f -> fnurbs), and in Pascal 
    (nurbs.p -> pnurbs).  The program continuously rotates a single NURBS
    surface.  Optionally, this surface may be trimmed by a single 
    circular trim curve.  To trim the surface, press and release the 
    LEFTMOUSE button.  To reverse this action, press the LEFTMOUSE button 
    again.  Pressing the Escape key will cause the program to quit.

  
    model:
 
      model is included to aquaint the user with the trimmed NURBS surface
    rendering utilities in the GL.  Refer to the README.model file for 
    more details about this example.


    sgiflag:

      demonstrates using a trimmed NURBS surface to display a waving flag 
    with an SGI logo cut from its center.  README.sgiflag has more info.


    heart:

      demonstrates using both a non-uniform knot sequence and the rational
    component of NURBS.


    Makefile NOTE:  Because this directory contains Fortran and Pascal
		    language code, as well as C, the decision was made
		    to ship the Makefile with the "default" target only
		    set to automatically make the C code example 
		    programs--nurbs and model.  If you have the Fortran
		    and/or the Pascal option loaded, you will have to 
		    manually edit the Makefile and include "fnurbs" 
		    and/or "pnurbs" in the default target rule if you 
		    wish to have these programs built automatically as 
		    well as the C code examples.
