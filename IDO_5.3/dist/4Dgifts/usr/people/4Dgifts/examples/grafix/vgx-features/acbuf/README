	The "acbuf" directory shows a few simple uses of the 
	accumulation buffer. The programs require a VGX to run on.
	VGX machines that do not have a hardware accumulation buffer
	will perform these functions rather slowly. If you need to
	use the accumulation buffer, it is highly recommended to 
	get the hardware.

	"boxblur" demonstrates motion blurring using a box filter
	technique. With this method, each frame has the same weight
	as any other. After a given number of frames have been 
	rendered it is necessary to back track and remove old frames
	from the accumulation buffer. The effect is the same as in
	stroboscopic photographs.

	"geomblur" demonstrates motion blurring using a geometric
	filter. In this program, each old frame diminishes in its
	contribution to the blurring. To see this, open the window and 
	watch the vapors follow the torus, then press the LEFTMOUSE 
	button and watch the "vapor trail" catch up to the object. 

	"scene" demonstrates how to use the accumulation buffer to 
	antialias things drawn with a perspective projection. This
	requires multiple passes with a slight perturbation of the
	objects onto the pixels. To run this one, press the LEFTMOUSE
	to see how the object looks with without antialiasing. Release
	the mouse button and it will become antialiased again. Rotations
	are based upon the verticle position of the mouse on the 
	screen.
