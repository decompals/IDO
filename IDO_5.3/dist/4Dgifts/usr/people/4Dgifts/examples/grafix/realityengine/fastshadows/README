README for shad - ($Revision: 1.2 $)

shad demonstrates the real-time shadow casting capability of the
IRIS-4D RealityEngine (RE).

A man page for using shad exists.  See shad(6).

Shadows have been done before with the Iris GL.  Examples of
shadows cast onto flat surfaces are found in jello, insect, and flight.

The RE uses a technique based on shadow maps, which allow casting shadows
onto curved surfaces and self-shadowing.
A good reference for this is "Rendering Antialiased Shadows with Depth Maps"
by Reeves, Salesin and Cook from the 1987 SIGGRAPH Proceedings.
Also, some of the mathematical basis for why it works is described in
"Fast Shadows and Lighting Effects Using Texture Mapping" by Segal, Korobkin,
van Widenfelt, Foran and Haeberli from 1992 SIGGRAPH Proceedings.

The Iris GL support for shadows includes:

- new arguments to texdef
    - TX_I_16
    - TX_BILINEAR_LEQUAL, TX_BILINEAR_GEQUAL

- new argument to tevdef
    - TV_ALPHA

- new GL call
    - displacepolygon(float scalefactor)
