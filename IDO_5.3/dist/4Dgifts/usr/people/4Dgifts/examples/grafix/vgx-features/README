              Explanation of the contents of the VGX directory.
              -------------------------------------------------

     This subtree is populated with various new routines that are 
     available only on machins with the VGX feature set. These features 
     include texture mapping, motion blurring, arbitrary clip planes, 
     and new light features.

     "acbuf" contains examples of using the accumulation buffer for such
     affects as motion blurring (using both box and geometric filtering
     methods), and scene antialiasing.

     "clip" contains code that differentiates between objects moving
     through static arbitrary clipping planes and arbitrary clipping planes 
     moving through static objects. Also demonstrated is how to clip
     out a concave shapped object through a multiple pass technique.

     "light" has enhancements of code from the graphics programming
     guide that demonstrates spotlights, lighting models which light
     both sides, and an interactive program which demonstrates 
     attenuation, including the new square attenuation factor.

     "stencil" includes examples that demonstrate using the stencil
     planes as a way of exercising a "superior z-buffer test".

     "texture" has code which demonstrates reading in an SGI image
     file to use as a texture, allows the system to generate texture
     coordinates to simulate contouring, "wrapping paper", or to
     simulate reflecting surfaces, and adding textures to a nurbs surface.
