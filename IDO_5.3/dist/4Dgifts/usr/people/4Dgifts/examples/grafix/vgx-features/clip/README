    This directory contains an example of user defined clipping planes. 
    This feature is currently available on VGX systems only. Note 
    the difference in approach to static clipping planes as opposed
    to dynamic clipping planes. The position of the plane is determined
    at definition time rather than at bind time. Code that requires
    a moving plane must redefine the plane within the loop that is
    manipulation the transformation stack.
