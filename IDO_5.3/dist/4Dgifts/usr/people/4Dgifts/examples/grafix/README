     This subtree is populated with various GL and fontmanager
     implementations .


     "fontmanager" illustrates some basic examples of how to use the 
     IRIS Font Library.  For more info on this, refer to Chapter 4, 
     "Using the IRIS Font Library" in the "Graphics Library Windowing
     and Font Library Programming Guide".

     "misc" contains modified, on-line examples from the old IRIS USER's 
     GUIDE, Volume 1, plus some extra programs including:  creating an 
     object file in the spin format;  implementing multiple cursors;  use 
     of the overlay bitplanes;  another picking example;  a single-line 
     textport;  a program which illustrates a technique for rotating an 
     object about a fixed set of axes,  as well as how backface removal 
     can be computed in software;  and 3 zbuffer programs both in RGB as 
     well as color-map mode.

     "light" contains on-line versions of the four examples from chapter 9
     on Lighting in the "Graphics Library Programming Guide" (GLPG),  
     Version 1.0, & 1.1.  NOTE:  These examples are no longer included in 
     the GLPG, Version 2.0.

     "nurbs" has C, Fortran, and Pascal examples illustrating 
     implementation of the new addition of Silicon Graphics' GL interface 
     for the display of trimmed Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) 
     surfaces.

     "skywriter" includes an example demonstrating the newest addition to 
     the 4D family line of IRIS machines.

     "realityengine" demonstrates a few of the RealityEngine features,
     such as projective textures, fast shadows, stereo in a window,
     and texture sharpening.

     "vgx-features" contains 5 sudirectories of various new programs 
     demonstrating the new GL routines available only on machines with
     VGX capability. SkyWriter and RealityEngine machines have the full 
     feature set as well. Indigo machines have most of the VGX feature 
     set available. These include texture mapping, motion blurring,
     arbitrary clip planes, new light features, and a program using the 
     stencil planes.
