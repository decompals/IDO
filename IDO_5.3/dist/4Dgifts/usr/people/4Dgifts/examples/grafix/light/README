                   README for light programming examples.
		   --------------------------------------


  These programs  used  to live in the [GT] "Graphics Library User's Guide"
  and showed up once more in the "Graphics Library Programming Guide", 
  (GLPG) Version 1.0, but for reasons too complicated to explain here, they
  no longer exist in the GLPG, Version 2.0.   This does not mean they are
  any less useful or appropriate for inclusion here in the 4Dgifts subtree.

  NOTE:  the minimum hardware congfiguration required for these programs to
	 run correctly is 24 color bitplanes and a Z-buffer is needed for
	 the two cylinder programs.



  cylinder1.c:  illustrates how to use the Graphics Library to perform 
	        lighting for a cylinder

  cylinder2.c:  displays two intersecting cylinders, using a different 
		surface material for each cylinder.  In addition, each
                cylinder is lit with two light sources.


  localatten.c: draws a flat green plate at z = 0; -1.0 <= x, y <= 1.0.
                The eye is 6 units above, looking down.  A light bounces
		up and down in the range 0.1 <= z <= 1.5, and x = y = 0.
		The lighting model attenuates intensity with  distance,
		so the center of the plate gets brighter as the light 
		moves closer.  The character string printed at the lower
		left of the plate shows the height of the light.  
		Note that the color is set after the cmov() command--the
		cmov() actually sends a vertex through the transformation,
		and it will set the current color.  If you move the 
		cpack() command just above the cmov() command, the 
		character string will be lighted and will appear in 
		varying shades of green.  

  platelocal.c: draws a flat plate with a simple local light.  If the 
                line at the top of the file is left in, the light is 
		fixed, and the plate moves.  Thus the bright spot on the
		plate will appear to move around (on the plate).  
		Sometimes, the plate gets in front of the light, and 
		almost disappears, since only the back is lit.  It does
		not quite disappear, since there is a small ambient 
		component for the default material.
                If the top line is deleted, the light is effectively 
		attached to the moving plate, so the lighted portion of 
		the plate moves with the plate.
