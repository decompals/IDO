		README for new lighting features on VGX


   The VGX supports three new lighting features of interest. They
   are currently not available on other platforms. These features
   include spotlights, lighting for both sides of the materail, and
   a squared factor for calulating light attenuation.

   "attenuation" is a user interactive program for seeing the relation-
   ship between light, position, constant attenuation, linear attenuation, 
   and sqared attenuation. As the light bounces up and down, the user
   may alter the attenuation parameters through the use of the number
   pad. Keys 1 and 2 alter constant attenuation, 4 and 5 change linear
   attenuation, and finally 7 and 8 may be used to see the effects of
   the squared term. The UPARROWKEY and DOWNARROWKEY will change the
   number of polygons used to draw the plate. All variable parameters
   are displayed in the graphics window beneath the plate. "attenuation"
   is an enhancement of ~4Dgifts/examples/light/localatten.c

   "spotlight" is another user interactive program to investigate
   spotlights with. Spotlights should be used in conjunction with number
   of polygons in an object along with attenuation factors to achieve
   the desired results. "spotlight" alters attenuation factors just
   as in "attenuation" with the added ability to change the spot light
   direction through the use of the "x", "y", and "z" keys in conjunction
   with the UPARROWKEY and DOWNARROWKEY. Hold down either up or down 
   arrow key and then press one of the direction keys. The user may
   also alter the cone angle as well as fall off rate for the light
   similarly by pressing the "c" key for cone angle or "f" key for fall
   off rate.

   "twoside" is a direct variation off cyclinder1.c found in ~4Dgifts/
   examples/light. It has been enhanced to include lighting of both
   front facing and back facing sides. Starting the program will demon-
   strate two-sided lighting with a different materials  for the outside
   of the cylinder and the inside of the cylinder. Pressing the LEFTMOUSE
   button will show the default back facing material, which is the
   currently bound front facing material.
