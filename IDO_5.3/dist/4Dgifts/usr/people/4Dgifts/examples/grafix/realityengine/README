    The programs in this directory illustrate a few of the new features
    now available with the Reality Engine. Features shown include
    stereo on a "per window basis", 3Dtextures, detail textrues,
    sharpening textures, and projected textures.

    "projtex" demonstrates the Reality Engine's capability of
     processing projective (homogenous) texture coordinates.
     Shown is the simulation of a spotlight and a pinhole
     slide projector, represented as 2D texture maps, illuminating
     arbitrary surfaces in a texture mapped scene. The user
     may select between projecting the spotlight or the slide
     texture maps. In addition, the user may elect to draw
     the geometry of the "virtual texture camera" to further
     illustrate the concepts.

    "3Danim" defines a 3D texture which is a sequence of images.
    The "animation" is then performed by rendering a polygon 
    whose "r" coordinate varies through the texture cube.

    "detail" allows the user to see the relationship between
    the various parameters involved in a detail texture. The
    M,N values, the spline values and the magnification filters
    may all be changed by clicking on the values on the screen.

    "sharp" shows how the various magnification types affect the
    final "sharpened" image. The user may choose to sharpen just
    the color components of the texture, the alpha values, or both.
    The texture toggles between a tree image and a black and white 
    grid.

    "stereo" shows how to render stereo images on a per window 
    basis. To perform this, the Video Output Format must be
    changed to 960x680_108s. To do this, use the setmon command.
    It will be necessary to stop and restart the X server. Please
    see the man page for setmon.

    "simp_projtex" and "simp_shadows" are simpler examples
    of the "projtex" and "fastshadows/shad" demos.
