        README for ~4Dgifts/examples/fontmanager source code examples
        -------------------------------------------------------------

    This directory contains the source code for 13 C programs, a UNIX makefile 
    needed to compile and link these C programs, and this README file.  The
    main purpose of these programs is to show you how to use the IRIS Font 
    Library.

    To compile and link all 13 programs, enter the command:

        make

    on a UNIX prompt.

    To compile and link a particular program, specify the name of that
    program on the "make" command line.  For example, to compile and
    link the program "basic," enter the command:

        make basic

    To run a linked program, enter the name of that program.  If you see
    a usage message that refers to:

        fontname
        size

    you need to specify the name of a font family, followed by a point size.

    To get a list of valid font family names, execute the program:
  
        enum_families 

    Typical point sizes are 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24.


   basic.c:          prints a string using the specified font in the closest
		     size available to the "size" specified.

   enum_families.c:  enumerates by name all the fonts currently available on 
                     the IRIS machine this program is executed on.

   fineclip.c:       prints characters using the fine clipping feature.
 
   fntinfo.c:        get overall font information and print it out.

   glyphinfo.c:      print out all glyph information (x/y -size, -origin, 
		     etc.) pertaining to the specified font.

   leading.c:        shows the leading (spacing between lines) of a given 
		     font.

   matched.c:        draws a string using the printer matching set available
		     via the fmprintermatch function.

   mult_rotate.c:    writes a "moving" string cummulatively rotated 15 
		     degrees times the number of iterations.

   rosetta.c:        draws base lines and rotated text forming a "rosetta"
		     symbol.

   rotate.c:         prints a rotated string using fmrotatepagematrix by a 
		     specified number of degrees.

   showclip.c:       fine clipping example demonstrating manually calculating
		     the clipping region's bounds.

   showfont.c:       print all the characters in a specified font associating
                     each with its ASCII numeric index.

   speedtest.c:      benchmark test indicating time it takes to write out the
		     string in the font specified.
