      Explanation of ~4Dgifts/examples/vgx/texture for texturing on VGX
      -----------------------------------------------------------------


    These programs demonstrate just a few of the uses for texture mapping.
    The features demonstrated in this directory are reflecting an image
    from an object, contouring in one or two directions, linear mapping
    in one or two directions, lighting with textures, adding textures
    to a nurbs surface. All of the programs use the utility "longimagedata"
    to read in an SGI format image to use as a texture. Texturing
    is available only on machines with the VGX feature set. Use getgdesc()
    to test for texture cpability.


    "envmap" is the latest addition to this directory of examples.  It
    demonstrates a progression of drawing quality:  two versions of a 
    cylinder can be rendered using wireframe, flat lighting, texture
    mapping and reflections.  In this program, reflection (or environment)
    mapping is done using texture mapping.  The TEXGEN(3G) man page is 
    essential reading for understanding how this function is a lynchpin 
    of the implementation of texture mapping on SGI VGX machines.

    "nurbtext" is an enhancement of the program found in ~4Dgifts/examples
    /nurbs. "nurbtex" takes advantage of the "longimagedata" subroutine
    to read in a texture. To make this useful to a nurbssurface, VGX
    has an optional nurbssurface "type" that may be specified. By specify-
    ing type as " N_T2D" the surface is a texture surface which is mapped
    to a possitional data surface. Other enhancements to this nurbs
    program include specifying nurbs polygon fill properties, trimming
    with nurbscurves, piecewise linear curves, and curves comprised
    of both types. Fill properties are specified via menu selections. 
    Trimming is done by pressing the LEFTMOUSE button.

    "reflection" uses texgen(TG_SPHEREMAP) to simulate reflections from
    a chrome surface. Pressing the "g" key will give a deep gold illusion.
    Pressing the "a" key will also invoke alpha blending.

    "texture" lets the graphics library assign coordinates automatically.
    All features of this program, except axis of rotation, are done through
    menu selection. The user can choose which of two textures to display,
    whether to blend or not, select lighting, and how to map textures to
    the surface. Selecting LINEAR mapping in both directions gives the
    wrapping paper effect while CONTOUR in one or more direction gives
    a motion through a field effect. There is a known bug that interferes
    with selecting in the S direction. It will contour, however the direction
    oif the specified plane is incorrect. A bug report is filed. Axis
    about which to rotate are selected by pressing the "x", "y", and "z"
    keys.
