	   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FILES IN ~4Dgifts/examples/video:


cgmode.c:

	Interactive program for moving among the various video modes.
	Handles all the various modes for the video including the CG2
	genlocking configurations.

	Help menus are there. It is highly recommended that you are
	familiar with the document "Using the Composite Video/Genlock 
	Board" and/or the man pages on the various gl calls - "getvideo()",
	"setvideo()", etc.  (Document #007-5350-020)

	IMPORTANT: 

		The escape key (Esc) will always take you back to 
		60Hz, non-interlaced, non-genlocked video.



The following programs take the video subsystem directly to the mode 
described. Again, familiarity with the video options is highly recommended.


cg0.c: 
	set the graphics control register to RS170,genlocked and
	set the cg2 to mode 0, lock to incoming composite video
	color overlay active

cg1.c:
	set the graphcs control register to RS170, genlocked
	set the cg2 to mode 1, lock to composite sync or composite monochrome

cg2.c:
	set the graphics control register to RS 170, genlock
	set the cg2 to mode 2, standalone master

cg3.c:
	set the graphics control register to RS170, genlock
	set the cg2 to mode 3, lock to incoming composite video

de3.c:
	set the graphics control register to RS170, RGB output, sync on green
	do not set the cg2 ( a 0x7 can be sent to the cg2 to turn it off)

cg0.c:
	set the graphics control register to RS170,genlocked and
	set the cg2 to mode 0, lock to incoming composite video
	color overlay active


The following program is a diagnostic for checking the basic
functionality of the registers and boards.

video.c:
 	diag program for testing the CG2 and DE3 registers (video overlay)
 	in various Standalone video modes as well as Genlock vido modes.
