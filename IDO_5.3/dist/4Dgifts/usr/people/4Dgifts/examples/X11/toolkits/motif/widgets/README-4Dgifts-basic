This file is both a place holder for the install and a README.

If ~4Dgifts/examples/X11/toolkits/motif/widgets is currently
empty.  This is because only the giftsbasic subsystem is
currently loaded.  4Dgifts has grown to the point where it
must be split.

                       **** - ****

To get the remaining components of this subtree load the
giftsfull subsystem.  Refer to the ~4Dgifts/README.subsys
file for a complete run-down on these two subsystems.
