         README for ~4Dgifts/examples/X11/Xlib source code examples
         ----------------------------------------------------------

      This directory contains 10 X Windows programming examples which 
      implement X11 graphics capabilities.  These programs are designed 
      and commented in such a way as to aid beginning X Windows 
      programmers.

      These programs are set up in such a fashion as to introduce 
      concepts by building on the previous program.  Each program comes 
      complete with a program.README file explaining in more detail what
      has changed since the previous program, and why certain functions
      are being called.  The .README files will also state which 
      previous-in-complexity program is being built upon and its place 
      in the sequence.

      All of the programs in this subtree include a queuing construct 
      that will kill the program by pressing any key.  Later programs 
      like "mouse" and "draw" require pressing a mouse button rather than 
      a keyboard button.



      #1:  simplewin       Creates a window.  Nothing fancy.

      #2:  placewin        Brings up window in a specified position.

      #3:  colorwin        Brings up a window by using colors.

      #4:  font            Shows how to access fonts and display fonts.

      #5:  colorfont       Shows how to apply colors to fonts.

      #6:  cursor          Shows how to alter the appearance of the cursor.

      #7:  queue           Explains queuing concepts.

      #8:  mouse           Explains limiting queue events to mice events. 

      #9:  leftmouse       Refines queueing down to the leftmouse.

      #10: draw            Uses all the previous examples to create
                           one simple graphics program.
