              ------------------------------------------------
  
          The Athena widget set is a library package layered on top
          of the Intrinsics and Xlib.  This layer extends the basic
          abstractions provided by X and provides the next layer of
          functionality primarily by supplying a cohesive set of 
          sample widgets.

          This subtree contains very simple examples on how to
          program the widgets.  See the corresponding README files
          for each directory to get a more detail explanation for 
          each widget.
  
          The widgets in all subdirectories rely on application
          default resource file Demo.add.  You must copy this file
          to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Demo.  If you don't want
          to change the /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/ directory,
          then fold the content of this file into yer ~/.Xdefaults
          file.

          To compile all the examples, simply type "make" here.
