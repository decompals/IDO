             ---------------------------------------------------

      This directory contains example programs that introduce many of
      the basic Motif widgets and programming techniques.


     1) label.c  --  an example of using the XmLabel widget

        This program illustrates how to create and use a label widget.
        In addition, it introduces the notion of XmStrings, the Motif
        version of a character string.  This program is extensively
        commented to be used as a reference for the other programs.


     2) push_button.c  --  an example of an XmPushButton widget

        This program illustrates using a push button, and introduces
        the concept of callback.

     3) scroll_bar.c  --  an example of an XmScrollBar widget

        This program demonstrates a Motif scrollbar, and expands on 
        the use of callbacks as introduced in push_button.c

     4) text.c  --  an example of an XmText widget

        This program introduces a text editor widget, as well as 
        making use of callbacks, and setting resources inside a 
        program.

     5) list.c  --  an example of an XmList widget

        This program illustrates a list widget.  This widget is 
        capable of providing a list of objects (strings) that the 
        user can select from.  In addition, this program again uses 
        callbacks and XmStrings.

     6) start.c  --  a basic framework for a Motif type program

        "start.c" provides a simple starting point for a motif 
        program.  It demonstrates the bare minimum required for a 
        working program.  
        NOTE: "start.c" will not function without adding some widget 
               as a child of the toplevel, or setting some resources 
               to make both the height and width of the toplevel 
               widget to be non-zero.
