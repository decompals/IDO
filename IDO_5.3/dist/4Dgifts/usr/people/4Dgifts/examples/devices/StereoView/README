             README for StereoView Example set of Source Code
            **************************************************

    This directory contains source for the following programming examples:

    libstereo.a : contains a set of support routines for programming stereo
                  --built from onoffstereo.c, stereopersp.c, stereowin.c,
                  and stereo.h
          backg : creates a simple stereo background
           grid : draws a simple stereo diagnostic program grid (viewed w/a
                  closed left eye, a red grid and the word "RIGHT" is 
                  visible, viewed w/a closed right eye, a blue grid and the
                  word "LEFT" is visible)
    nestedcubes : a simple stereo application
 on/off -stereo : simple routines for turning on and off stereo mode.

    To compile--as 4Dgifts user--type 'make' in this directory.  If you 
    are doing this for the first time, make will first build libstereo.a 
    from onoffstereo.c, stereopersp.c, stereowin.c, and, stereo.h.


       If you want to see:           Then execute the command(s):
      ------------------------       ----------------------------
      if stereo works properly       grid
      a fullscreen application       nestedcubes
      a windowed application         backg; sleep 2; nestedcubes -w
      a normal display               offstereo

         | You will need IRIX 3.3 or later to run these demos. |

 Here's a short description of what is involved in stereo-izing an application:
    
    1) Your application must turn on stereo by issuing a 
        setmonitor(STR_RECT) command.  You should check to see if 
        STR_RECT mode is supported by issuing a getgdesc(GD_STEREO)
        command.  You should also constrain the mouse to the lower 
        half of the screen using a setvaluator() command.  (All 
        three of the above-mentioned calls come from the Graphics 
        Library (GL)--consult 3G-section (GL Reference Manual) man 
        pages.)  A routine called stereo_on() in libstereo.a does 
        all of this for you; see the code in onoffstereo.c, and the 
        comments in stereo.h.
    
    2) You must decide if the application should take over the 
        entire screen, or if it should run in (user-resizeable) 
        windows.  If it takes over the entire screen, you should 
        set up two viewports (one for each eye) in the upper and 
        lower halves of the screen.  If it should run in a window,
        you will have to open two windows, one in the upper and 
        one in the lower half of the screen.  If it runs in 
        windows, you will also probably want to put up an 
        appropriate background to cover up all of the regular, 
        non-stereo windows;  see the code in backg for an example.  
        See the code in nestedcubes for an example application, 
        and see stereo.h for some simple support routines for 
        doing stereo in windows.
    
    3) A stereo application must draw its scene twice, once for the
        left-eye view, and once for the right-eye view.  The 
        'stereopersp' command in libstereo.a can be very useful for 
        generating correct perspective stereo images.  For more 
        information, see the Summer 1989 issue of the "Iris 
        Universe," (pp. 16-18, 20-22) which has a very informative
        article by Thant Tessman about stereo projections.  Again, 
        see the code in nestedcubes for an example using 
        stereopersp().
