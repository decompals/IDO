NOTE:  prior to the IRIX 4D1-3.3 Software Release, there existed in this
       directory a copy of the tabletd.c source file for the tablet daemon.
       This was included so that users could modify it to accommodate their
       need to map more of the tablet's physical area to the full graphics
       console screen.  we have since changed tabletd to accept an extra
       argument which is this square (same for X and Y) aspect ratio 
       previously accessible manually by recompiling the source and 
       inserting the new tabletd daemon in /etc/gl.  please refer to 
       TABLETD(1M) for more information.



                                  SUBDIRS:
                                  --------

    1). Spaceball:
    --------------
        contains source code (2 "simple", 2 complex programs) to 
        familiarize the user with the basic concepts involved with 
        programming the Spaceball input device.

    2). StereoView:
    ---------------
        contains source code demonstrating GL programs that implement 
        stereo mode programming.  Includes files (onoffstereo.c, 
        stereopersp.c, stereowin.c, and stereo.h) which are used to 
        construct a stereo library (libstereo.a) which is used to 
        compile programs which 

             1.) create a simple stereo background (backg),
             2.) draws a simple stereo diagnostic program grid (grid),
             3.) demonstrate a simple stereo application (nestedcubes),
             4.) a set of utilities for turning on & off stereo mode 
                 (onstereo, offstereo),

    3). devscsi:
    ------------
        contains source code which builds 2 generic SCSI device example 
        programs.

    4). input:
    ----------
        contains the source for the streams modules which replace the
	previous device daemons in the new world of X.  These convert a 
        device-specific data-stream into a device-independent format 
	that the X server reads.  This is exactly what the old device 
	daemons used to do.  The only difference is that now they are 
	"in-line" (i.e. now there's no need to do context switching, 
	etc.--everything happens in streams).




    See the README files in each of these 3 subdirs for more info/details.




                                   PROGRAMS:
                                   ---------

    1). bpex - simple program to test/demo the bitpad's functionality.

    2). dialtest - simple program to test the Dials box functionality.

    3). dialbuttons - line drawing program done via the dials.  buttons 
        are used to change the noise value.  A useful program to confirm 
        that the dial & button box is hooked up/installed correctly.

    4). printtest - is helpful for those just starting out with the 
        machine who have something like a Tektronics RGB color printer 
        that can hook directly into the back the console where there are 
        RGB cable output lines that one can tie directly into the 
        printer itself.


    5). knobs - demo "etch-a-sketch" program using the dial & button box.
   
        The purpose of knobs is two-fold: 
   
        1. To exercise all the dials and all the buttons on the boxes as 
           well as the text display and the leds for each of the buttons.
   
        2. To show a simple example of interfacing to the Dial & Button 
           Box using the graphics library.
   
      The program is basically an enhanced version of "etch-a-sketch".  
      The dials are used in pairs (one for X movement, one for Y 
      movement). 
 
      Program start up:
      ================
 
      When the program starts it clears the screen to a neutral 
      "etch-a-sketch grey" and then proceeds to light up all of the leds
      in the button array one at a time.  It starts out with the led in 
      the top left hand corner, goes across the row to the right, goes 
      to the left side of the next row, and procedes until it gets to 
      the bottom right hand corner, and then starts all over again.  
      While this is happening, the text display should read "PRESS 31".
 
      To stop this process, press the button on the right end of the 
      bottom row (button 31).
 
      Dial pair selection:
      ===================
 
      There are four pairs of valuators (dials) available to move and 
      draw on the screen.  Only one of the pairs is available at any one 
      time.  Which pair is active is determined by the four buttons on 
      the left-most column of the button array.  The top button of the 
      column selects the top pair, the next button selects the next pair 
      down, and so on.  The left dial of the pair controls the X 
      movement while the right one controls the Y movement.
 
      Choosing a pair will cause the led for the appropriate button to 
      light up.
 
      Drawing color selection:
      =======================
 
      Lines can be drawn on the screen in any of 7 different colors.  
      There are two ways to change the current line drawing color.  One 
      is to press one of the color selection buttons in the button array
      (the four buttons on the top row of the array and the three 
      left-most buttons on the bottom row).
 
      Clearing the screen:
      ===================
 
      To clear the screen, press the right-most button of the bottom row.
 
 
      Drawing circles and squares using the buttons:
      =============================================
 
      The remaining buttons which have not been described draw circles 
      or squares of predetermined sizes and colors centered at the 
      current screen position. 
 
      The five buttons in the 2nd row from the top draw circles in 
      various sizes.  The five buttons in the third row draw filled 
      circles of various sizes.  The five buttons in the fourth row 
      draw squares of various sizes.  The five buttons in the fifth 
      row draw filled squares of various sizes.  
 
      For each of these rows, the buttons on the left draw the larger 
      objects, while the buttons on the right draw the smaller objects.
 
      Each time any of these buttons is pressed, the text display will 
      show either "CIRCLE" or "SQUARE" depending on the button you 
      pushed.
 
      Summary of button functions:
      ===========================
 
      Switch (button) numbers are shown in each location.
