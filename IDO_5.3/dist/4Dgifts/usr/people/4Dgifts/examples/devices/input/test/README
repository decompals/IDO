The code in this directory makes it possible to test
device streams modules without linking them into the
kernel.   To use this test code, place the code to your
streams module in ../io and add your module to the list
of modules in Makefile.   Modify inputtest.c (as described
in comments in the file) to use your device and run:
     % make
in this directory.   Next, link the tty device to which your
device is connected to /dev/input/<name> where <name> is the
name of your streams module.  Now simply run:
     % inputtest <name>
where name is the name of your streams module.    inputtest
should print messages whenever a valuator or button on your
device changes.
