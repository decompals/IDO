This directory contains example programs which use the X
input extension.   The file "IEUtils.c" contains some utility
functions which make it a little easier to use the input
extension.  Feel free to use them.

To build the programs in this directory, use the command:
% xmkmf
To create a Makefile and then just:
% make

The make should complete without errors and produce the following
programs:
    setptr -- Usage: setptr <device_name>
	      Changes the core X pointer device to a named extension device.
    setkbd -- Usage: setkbd <device_name>
	      Changes the core X keyboard device to a named extension device.
   devctrl -- Usage: devctrl <device_name> <control> <value> [+]
	      Issues an SGI Device control.   Appends a CR to the request
	      if '+' is specified.
  devquery -- Usage: devquery <device_name> <query>
	      Queries a device for the value named by <query>.  Prints
	      the returned to stdout and exits with status 0 if successful.
	      If neither the server nor the device recognize the query,
	      devquery exits with status -1.
     xlist -- Usage: xlist
	      Prints a description of all of the devices connected to the X
	      server (including core devices).
 xselinput -- Usage: xselinput [options]
              Opens all extension devices and reads events of types specified
	      on the command line.  Run xselinput without options for a list
	      of options with brief descriptions.
