        ---------------------------------------------------------


        Currently there are two generic SCSI device example programs:

  
   1. iisc - a simple program that uses the /dev/scsi generic scsi
      driver to send .im8 bitmap images to the Apple LaserWriter II SC
      over the SCSI bus.
   
   2. inquire - a very simple program that uses the /dev/scsi generic scsi
      driver that returns inquiry information about the devices on
      the command line.
   
   NOTE1: iisc and inquiry require that you have the 'ds' driver in your
	kernel.  This driver is not normally included on some hardware.

	If /usr/sysgen/system file contains a "USE: ds" line
	the driver is included.

	If /usr/sysgen/system file has a line "*INCLUDE: ds" the driver
	is not included and the comment character '*' should be 
	removed.

	Edit the /usr/sysgen/system file and uncomment the line

		*INCLUDE: ds

	to look like.

		INCLUDE: ds

	Then relinking the kernel by invoking "autoconfig".  	
	"/etc/autoconfig is a link to /etc/init.d/autoconfig  
	a shell script with correctly invokes "lboot".

	It is also possible to check a kernel for symbols 
	involved in this driver:

	nm /unix | egrep "dsinit|dsopen|dsclose"


   NOTE2: always keep a system note book of changes to kernel
   configuration files.
