   A quick plotting package demonstrating FORTRAN grafix.


The purpose of this quick plotting package is two-fold:
 
   - give a new user a useful two dimensional display of their 
             data in the transition period from the traditional 
             terminal--mainframe scientific workplace to the 
             workstation distributed computing environment. 

   - give a complete, simple, FORTRAN-based application in 
             graphics to be used as an example.



To run this program, type "make", and, when complete:

% quick < test.data


Each subroutine can be expanded upon and used as a templete 
for use in other graphics programs.  The main graphics loop 
is the place to start.

New graphics library v commands (in this case, the v2f formats
2 dimensions, floating point representation) are used in 
contrast to the more traditional move and draw as these take 
greater performance advantage of Silicon Graphics architecture.

Common problems with ORDER of commands can be avoided by 
following the pattern set in setwin.f which configures a 
window and ties the graphics options to that window.

The graphics identifier GID of the window is passed to allow
for expansion to multiple windows.

Recommended modifications:

first
change colors of background, title, labels
change length of above
change number and color of grid lines
change thickness of graph 

next
add multiple windows: multiple dependent functions 
add dynamic data sets


A showcase full screen slide show file is included with
more details.  This includes three slides.  Use the "Page Up" 
and "Page Down" buttons on the keyboard.

To run this:  % showcase quick.slide.show


The source of create.f is included to provide data for testing.

Data sets included: cos,sin,test,untitled.
