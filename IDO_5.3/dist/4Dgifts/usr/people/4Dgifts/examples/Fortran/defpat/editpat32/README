   -------------------------------------------------------------------------


     editpat32 implements a DEFPATTERN(3G) 32X32 editor.

       The program can be started with an empty or previously defined 32X32
     pattern input file or an already existant file and a new output 
     filename.  This program has its own popup menu--accessible via 
     RIGHTMOUSE--allowing you to quit or save the pattern output to a file.

       An example 32X32 pattern file is included:

             example.pattern

       To invoke the program with the above file execute:

             editpat32 example.pattern

       To save the above example file to another filename execute:

             editpat32 example.pattern example.sav

       NOTE:  if you do not explicitly specify an output filename, and
	      execute the save option from the popup menu, the input file
	      you invoked the program with will be overwritten with the
	      new pattern you have created or modified.

       LEFTMOUSE toggles the color ("on" to "off" or vice versa) of 
     whichever pixel the mouse is currently on top of.

       Besides showing how to make DEFPATTERN(3G) designs, the program 
     shows how to build popup menus, display lists, use MAPW2(3G), and 
     implement picking mode on user-stated orthographic projects.  Also
     basic file I/O and usage of getarg/iargc is demonstrated.  This 
     program can be easily ported to older SGI machines of the 3000/2000 
     family.
