 README for ~4Dgifts/examples/Fortran/defpat source code programming examples
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


      This subtree contains 2 programs--each in its own directory--called
    editpat32 and showpat32 which implement a 32X32 pixel pattern editor 
    and viewer respectively.  Both of these programs revolve around the
    DEFPATTERN(3G) GL call which defines patterns.  The size of such 
    patterns is not limited to 32X32--they can also be square areas of
    16 or 64 bit patterns as well as 32.  The choice here is arbitrary.
