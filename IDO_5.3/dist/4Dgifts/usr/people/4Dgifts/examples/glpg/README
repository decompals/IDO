        Explanation of the contents of ~4Dgifts/examples/glpg subtree 
        -------------------------------------------------------------


    ~4Dgifts/examples/glpg contains 16 subdirectories that contain the 
    on-line source copy versions of the hard-copy listings found in the
    chapters of the  "Graphics Library Programming Guide", Version 2.0,
    (GLPG) itself:
    

    ch01:  Introduction  
             1 program, that clears the graphics window to color GREEN.

    ch02:  Drawing
             16 programs demonstrating subroutines that draw many of
             the basic geometric figures: points, lines, polygons,
             rectangles, circles, arcs, and meshes.

    ch03:  Characters and Fonts
             3 programs demonstrating ways to display textual information.
             (These programs do not demonstrate usage of the font manager
             that is described in the 4Sight Users guide.)

    ch04:  Display and Color Modes
             11 programs covering using the colormap as well as straight
             RGB color, smooth shading, defining a gammaramp, multimap
             mode, and blinking colors.

    ch05:  Input
	     1 program that demostrates the proper use of polling and
	     queuing.

    ch06:  Animation
             1 program that implements doublebuffering which is the method
             used to create graphics that appear to change smoothly.

    ch07:  Coordinate Transformations
             5 programs demonstrating ways to manipulate geometric
             figures and viewpoints in 3-D space in very general ways.

    ch08:  Hidden Surface Removal    
             2 programs that demonstrate ways to perform hidden surface
             removal using zbuffering.  

    ch09:  Lighting
	     1 simple program that demostrates use of the GL lighting 
	     routines.

    ch10:  Pixels
	     1 simple program using rectcopy to implement zoom.

    ch11:  Drawing Modes
	     3 programs: 2 implementing writemasks, and 1 showing how
	     to implement a multiple-color cursor.

    ch12:  Picking and Selecting
	     2 programs:  1 demonstrating picking and 1 program showing
	     the use of gselect.

    ch13:  Depth-Cueing
	     1 program implementing depth cueing.

    ch14:  Curves and Surfaces
	     4 programs: 3 demonstrating curves, and 1 showing an 
	     implementation of a patch.

    ch15:  Smooth Lines, Smooth Points, and Alpha Blending
	     10 programs: 1 using the accumulation buffer for anti-aliasing,
	     1 demonstrating using blendfunction to implement alphablending,
	     1 showing yer basic, GL line-drawing program *without* anti-
	     aliasing, 1 color-map and 1 RGB line-drawing anti-aliasing 
	     program, 1 color-map and 1 RGB point-drawing anti-aliasing 
	     program, and 3 RGB polygon programs showing progressively more 
	     complex examples of doing polygon anti-aliasing.

    ch17:  Feedback
	     1 program demonstrating the use of feedback.

    ch18:  Textures
	     1 program demonstrating the use of textures implementing a 
	     brick pattern mapped onto a planar surface.
