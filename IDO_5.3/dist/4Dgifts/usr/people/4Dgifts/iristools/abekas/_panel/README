Abekas A60 Control Panel

Acp creates an Abekas keyboard on your SGI 4D.  The keyboard functions
in the same manner as the actual Abekas keyboard.  In addition, some
functions of the A60 menus are provided in pop-up menus.

Acp consists of the files:
	drive.c - main & user interaction
	button.c - nifty "3D buttons"
	a60comm.c - ethernet communication to the A60
	a60.h - definitions
	Makefile - the makefile

Acp works by establishing an ethernet connection to your a60.  The name acp
uses to establish the connection is "a60".  This name must be in your 
workstation's "/etc/hosts" file, as the name or alias for the a60.

To operate the keyboard simply press any mouse button over the desired key.
See your A60 operations manual for further details on key functions.
The following keys do not work:
	menu
	record
	trim
	enter
	field
The record, trim, and field keys will be working in a later release.
The menu and enter keys don't seem to have a purpose in this keyboard.
(Acp has no effect on the A60 menu monitor.)

The Mousepad.
This is the area to the right of the keyboard where the trackball on the
real keyboard is.  This area allows you access to play/stop/rewind functions
without having to look back at the workstation to position the mouse.
When the mouse is over this area:
			"PLAY" pad	"JOG" pad
	left button	reverse		jog + 1
	middle button	stop
		stop	right button	play
		jog - 1
If you continue to hold the button down, the function will repeat.


Menus.
A pop-up menu appears when the right button is pressed over the gray
background.
	enable/disable - performs this function on the real keyboard.
	frame mode - A60 displays frames
	field mode - A60 displays fields
	601 input #1 - video in comes from source #1
	601 input #2 - video in comes from source #2
	clearsegs - remove all defined segments from the segment list.
	record lockout - protects or unprotects the segment defined by
		the current in and out values.
	patterns - writes test patterns into the A60 framestore. Note that
		the pattern is not put on the disk.
	makemap - remake the color palette (after it has been destroyed
		by model or preview).
	trigger - set the timecode trigger.
	exit

Acp opens an ethernet connection when run, so it will be unsuccessful if
another connection (rlogin) is already open.  If acp is closed (or "stowed")
the connection is closed, then reopened when the icon is reopened.



*****************************************************************
* IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE FRAME NUMBER DISPLAY			*
*****************************************************************

The display of the current disk location in the top right hand corner
is a new feature.  However, it is possible for this display to be
incorrect!

	a) any play,jog, or goto by someone using the normal control panel
	   will not be reflected on the workstation!
	b) due to a mysterious bug, the display will sometimes be
	   one frame off after using the jog button several times in
	   a row.  I would love to hear from anyone who can solve this
	   problem.  A kludge in the code has reduced the frequency that
	   this pops up.

To make sure that the display is correct, press stop (or the middle button
over the play/jog pad).  This will cause the correct frame number to be
displayed.



*****************************************************************
* ACP Icon							*
*****************************************************************

An icon is provided for when the program is "stowed".  The file "acp.icon"
must be copied to "/usr/NeWS/icons".
