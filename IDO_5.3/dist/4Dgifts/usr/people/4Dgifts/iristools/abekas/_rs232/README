                              Abekas RS-232

                           Abekas Video Systems
                            Simon Carter - 1991


The two .c files contain routines which form the basis of an RS-232 serial
control interface for the A60 or A64 from an SGI 4D.  As there is no 'main()',
the files are not standalone and a Makefile is not included.

BUGS: For reasons which I haven't yet investigated the current response is
      always for the previous command. (Presumably read doesn't wait for very
      long before returning.)     - a sleep might fix it!


a60_rep.c -
          This file contains the reply function which will parse a reponse
          packet from an A60 or A64, most respones are skipped.  The normal
          length is a response is four bytes, execptions are noted.  The A60
          generally supports a subset of the A64 commands and responses.
          Conditional compilation is used to resolve irreconcilable differences.

responses.h -
            This is the header file for a60_rep.c.  It contains definitions
            required for parsing the responses from an A60 or A64.

serial.c -
         This file contains functions for opening, formatting, sending, and
         receiving data to/from the A60 or A64.  Also included are a few
         pre-built machine commands; stop, play freeze, etc..  More may be
         created from data found in the A60 External Protocol Manual 74-M053-00.
