	abekas   - device-specific tools for Abekas digital video
        images   - some images that can be "ipaste"d to the screen 
        imgtools - a collection of tools for dealing with images
        include  - files defining various data structures
        libgutil - a utility library
        libimage - a library for reading and writing images
        tools    - a collection of tools that use the window manager

    You probably should put iristools/imgtools and iristools/tools
    in your path to make it easier to get at these goodies. . .
    in c-shell you will type something like:

    % set path=( /usr/people/4Dgifts/iristools/imgtools \
                /usr/people/4Dgifts/iristools/tools $path)

    Do a make in this directory, /usr/people/4Dgifts/iristools, 
    and wait for it to finish.  This will make libimage.a and 
    libgutil.a, a bunch of image processing tools, and a collection
    of general purpose screen tools.  However, all the executables
    that will be built in imgtools and tools will consume quite a 
    bit of diskspace.  Some of these exectuables--most all of those
    programs inside tools--already have been built and live in /usr/sbin.

    NOTEs:  YOUR UID MUST BE SET TO 4Dgifts (or guest depending on which 
            line comes first in /etc/passwd).  This is essential because 
            of the need for the shell to recognize that ~4Dgifts/bin is 
            in its path so it can find ~4Dgifts/bin/ranlib when it goes
            to make a symbol definition file in the archives being built 
            for the two libraries libimage.a and libgutil.a.  ~/bin/ranlib
            is a script to enable these libraries to be built on 2000/3000
            as well as 4D machines.  The idea here is that the iristools
            subtree was designed to able to be copied in its entirety from
            a 4D to a 2000/3000 machine, and be compiled/run on this 
            family of machine as well.


                Good Luck !!
