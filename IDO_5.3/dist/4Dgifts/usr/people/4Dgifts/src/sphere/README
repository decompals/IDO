************************* README for Sphere Directory **************************


    The sphere library provides a sphere rendering 
	    utility with internal data management
	    that provides an immediate-mode-style interface, while
	    maintainig an internal cache of sphere data.
    The compiled library, libsphere.a, is in /usr/lib and the
    header file, sphere.h, is in /usr/include.

    In this directory we have placed the source code for the molecule demo,
    mview.  This is to give a realistic example of using the different
    functions of the sphere library.

	    source files: mview.c mview.h menu.c 
			  light.c light.h fileio.c filio.h

	    to run: mview -n molecule
		molecule = file where the
			file.bonds is in the directory /usr/demos/data/atom
			or in the current directory.
		-I dir
			specifies an additional directory
			to have molecule files.

		-?
			prints a usage statement

	    m_mview is a buttonfly file of command lines so you can
		also run /usr/demos/buttonfly m_mview
