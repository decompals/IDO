			      -----------------

     There is a very swank program called DGLFAX(1) which is useful for
     sending an electronic fax (a piece of your workstation's screen) 
     from your screen to a remote host system.  The account on the remote 
     host must be equivalent--accessible directly by/to you--or have no 
     password.

     We have included the source to this program in the 4Dgifts account
     under ~4Dgifts/src/dglfax so that you have a genuine utilitarian
     source example demonstrating DGL usage in a qualified way.

     To enable this program to run, you will need to configure your two 
     systems--the local and the remote machines--by performing the 
     following steps on each as root user:  (for more info, refer to 
     section 6.2.1, "DGL Service", in the "Using the GL/DGL Interfaces" 
     part of the "4Sight Programmer's Guide".)



     1. check the entry (near the bottom) for "sgi-dgl" in /etc/services
        and uncomment this if it is (i.e. has a leading "#" character).
	NOTE: if running YP for the services data-base, then you want to
	      change the services data-base on the yp-master.

     2. check the entry for "sgi-dgl" in /usr/etc/inetd.conf and uncomment
	it if if is (i.e. has a leading "#" character).

     3. Now execute the following command line to force inetd to reread its
	configuration file.

            killall 1 inetd

     You can verify that inetd is listening by running

	    /usr/etc/netstat -a 

     and look for a line containing "*.sgi.dgl".  If this entry is active
     you should be all ready to proceed with dglfax across the appropriate
     systems.
