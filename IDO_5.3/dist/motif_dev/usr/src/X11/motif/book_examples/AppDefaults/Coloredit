! NOTE: this defaults file does not match the one in the book.
!	The reason is that after the book went to press, the author found
!       the one in the book insufficiently general in real use.  This file
!	is the one supplied in the on-line version you can get from the book's
!	publisher.  If you want one just like the book's, you will have to
!	enter it yourself.
