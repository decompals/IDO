These examples are similar to those in the original version of the book, "X
Window Systems Programming and Applications with Xt", which used the HP
widget set. However, these examples now use the Motif widget set entirely.
In many cases, you can probably follow along from the old book. However,
I've not made any attempt to keep the examples exactly as in the original
book. In some cases the examples are identical, except for the use of
Motif. In other cases, the examples had to be altered drastically to
accommodate Motif. In still other cases, I simple decided to try a
different, hopefully better way to do things. And then a few examples are
all new for this edition.

Note that these programs are examples used to illustrate various aspects of
X, Xt, and Motif for the book. They don't necessarily represent the best
way to write certain tools, nor are the programs necessarily useful in
their own right (though I hope some are). Each program was intended to
illustrate some point, and therefore the programs are often somewhat
contrived in order to do just that and also to fit into the space allotment
within a chapter.  It's not that any example is necessary the wrong way to
do something, but the goal was to demonstrate a particular feature of Xt or
Motif, not necessary to show the best way to design a graphics editor, or a
file viewer, or whatever.  I hope the examples are useful for the purpose
they were intended to serve.

I've caught a few bugs and made minor changes to a few of the programs
since the book went to press many months ago. These are noted in the
programs where they occur, with the old code ifdef'd as

#ifdef JUST_LIKE_BOOK
 /* Code described in book */
#else
 /* Fixed or improved version */
#endif

There are also a few extra programs, variations of examples that didn't
make it into the book for one reason or another.


=====  SGI NOTES  =====

>>  These example programs are unsupported at this time.  SGI has
>>  fixed some bugs in them.  It is known that bugs remain; bug reports
>>  are welcome, but fixing the bugs is not guaranteed.  See the Release
>>  Notes for a current list of example program bugs.

To build the book programs:

1. If you have installed a new version of Motif over an old one, we suggest
   that you first:

	cd /usr/src/X11/motif/book
	make clean

   This is because the installation process will not delete any object files
   which were built from the previously installed version.

2. Application default files -- you can either:

   Copy all of the default files to the standard public place:
	% su
	% cp /usr/src/X11/motif/book/AppDefaults/* /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults

    Or else, each time you want to run the examples, let X11 know where they
    are.  To do that, you should append ":%N" to your $XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.
    If you do not have $XUSERFILESEARCHPATH set, then set $XAPPLRESDIR to ".".


3. Building example programs & Size -- the book examples tree requires about
   1.5 megabytes as shipped.  With all examples fully built, it requires about
   32 megabytes.  To build the demos, you can either:

    make all of the example programs:
	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/book	# Top of the example programs tree
	% make all			# Build all of the demos

    or else, to conserve space, just make those you care about:
	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/book/lib
	% make all			# Examples need the library
	% cd /usr/src/X11/motif/book/XXX	# XXX is the example you want
	% make all			# Build all examples in that directory

4. README's -- read the README file, if any, in the directory of any example
   you want to run.  It will give any non-standard information.
