			MOTIF SOURCE DIRECTORY NOTES

Each sub-directory contains demonstration software, and has in it a
README file that:

	* tells about the software under that directory
	* tells how to build and run that software
	
The sub-directories are:

	 * book_examples -- the source to the example programs from the book
		The X Window System
		Programming and Applications with Xt
		OSF/Motif Edition

	 * osf_demos -- the official OSF/Motif demonstration program sources

	 * overlay_demos -- versions of the official OSF/Motif demonstration
			program sources, modified to show how to use
			overlay and popup planes.

	* Sgm -- demo software corresponding to libSgm

/usr/src/X11/motif also contains two files:

	* README -- this file

	* mmkmf (Motif make Makefile) -- a symbolic link to
		/usr/bin/X11/mmkmf.  The symlink is just forf backwards
		compatibility.

		"mmkmf" is a script to ease making an initial
	 	Makefile from an Imakefile.  This is used to build the
		demonstration programs; it is also generally useful.
		
		To use mmkmf in your own source tree:

			* Set up your Imakefile(s)
			* cd to the top directory in your source tree
			* give the command "mmkmf"
			
		This will make your initial Makefile.  Then the command "Make
		Makefiles will make any other Makefiles in your source tree.
