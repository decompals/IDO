.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LMrmInitialize\*O
function must be called to prepare an application to use MRM
widget-fetching facilities.
You must call this function prior to fetching a widget.
However, it is good programming practice to call
\*LMrmInitialize\*O
prior to performing any
MRM operations.
.PP 
\*LMrmInitialize\*O
initializes
.iX "MrmInitialize" "description"
the internal data structures that MRM needs to
successfully perform type
conversion on arguments and to successfully access widget creation
facilities.
An application must call
\*LMrmInitialize\*O
before it uses other
MRM functions.
